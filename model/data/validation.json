[{"text": "Brothers and sisters, as I stand here in this inspiring worldwide general conference and feel your strength and your spirits, I cannot help but think of the words of the Apostle Peter: \u201c[Lord], it is good for us to be here.\u201d1\nThat is not exactly what Alma said after preaching to the people in Ammonihah. Alma left the city due to the wickedness of the people. Soon an angel appeared to Alma and called him to \u201creturn to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city.\u201d2\nAlma did so \u201cspeedily,\u201d entering \u201cthe city by another way.\u201d3\n\u201cAs he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?\n\u201cAnd the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.\u201d4\nThe man was Amulek.\nNow, did Alma just happen upon Amulek? No, it was no coincidence that he went into the city by the way that would lead him to this faithful man who would become his missionary companion.\nElder Neal\u00a0A. Maxwell once explained: \u201cNone of us ever fully utilizes the people-opportunities allocated to us within our circles of friendship. You and I may call these intersectings \u2018coincidence.\u2019 This word is understandable for mortals to use, but coincidence is not an appropriate word to describe the workings of an omniscient God. He does not do things by \u2018coincidence\u2019 but \u2026 by \u2018divine design.\u2019\u201d5\nOur lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another\u2014if we are responsive to spiritual promptings. Looking back, we can see His hand in our lives.\nWe can see such heavenly intervention when Nephi returns to get the plates from Laban. He \u201cwas led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things [that he] should do.\u201d6 Laban was soon before him in a drunken stupor, and Nephi slew him, retrieved the plates, and fled back to his brothers. Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by \u201cdivine design\u201d?\nSignificant events unfold in the gospel and in the Church that further the kingdom of God on earth. They are not by accident but by God\u2019s plan. He who fashioned this world can calm the seas with His word and can steer both Alma and Amulek and Nephi and Laban to be at the right place at precisely the right time.\nLikewise, events and associations unfold in each of our lives that further God\u2019s work on earth.\nDear Elder Joseph\u00a0B. Wirthlin spoke of an occasion when President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson said to him: \u201cThere is a guiding hand above all things. Often when things happen, it\u2019s not by accident. One day, when we look back at the seeming coincidences of our lives, we will realize that perhaps they weren\u2019t so coincidental after all.\u201d7\nMost often, our good works are known to only a few. They are, however, recorded in heaven. One day, we will stand as a witness of our whole-souled devotion to works of righteousness. No trial or calamity can derail God\u2019s plan of happiness. Indeed, by \u201cdivine design,\u201d \u201cjoy cometh in the morning.\u201d8 \u201cI came into the world to do the will of [the] Father,\u201d9 Jesus taught. Dear brothers and sisters, so have we.\nThrough the experience of my own life\u2019s journey, I know that the Lord will move us on that seeming chessboard to do His work. What may appear to be a random chance is, in fact, overseen by a loving Father in Heaven, who can number the hairs of every head.10 Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father\u2019s notice.11 The Lord is in the small details of our lives, and those incidents and opportunities are to prepare us to lift our families and others as we build the kingdom of God on earth. Remember, as the Lord said to Abraham, \u201cI know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee.\u201d12\nThe Lord placed me in a home with loving parents. By the world\u2019s standards, they were very ordinary people; my father, a devoted man, was a truck driver; my angel mother, a stay-at-home mom. The Lord helped me find my lovely wife, Melanie; He prompted a businessman, who became a dear friend, to give me an employment opportunity. The Lord called me to serve in the mission field, both as a young man and as a mission president; He called me to the Quorum of the Seventy; and now He has called me as an Apostle. Looking back, I realize I did not orchestrate any of those moves; the Lord did, just as He is orchestrating important moves for you and for those you love.\nWhat should you be looking for in your own life? What are God\u2019s miracles that remind you that He is close, saying, \u201cI am right here\u201d? Think of those times, some daily, when the Lord has acted in your life\u2014and then acted again. Treasure them as moments the Lord has shown confidence in you and in your choices. But allow Him to make more of you than you can make of yourself on your own. Treasure His involvement. Sometimes we consider changes in our plans as missteps on our journey. Think of them more as first steps to being \u201con the Lord\u2019s errand.\u201d13\nSome months ago our granddaughter joined a youth group to tour several Church history sites. The final itinerary noted that she would be passing through the very area where her missionary brother, our grandson, was serving. Our granddaughter had no intention of seeing her brother on his mission. However, as the bus entered the town where her brother was serving, two missionaries could be seen walking down the street. One of the missionaries was her brother.\nAnticipation filled the bus as the youth asked the bus driver to pull over so she could greet her brother. In less than one minute, after tears and sweet words, her brother was back on his way to fulfill his missionary duties. We later learned that her brother had been on that street for less than five minutes, walking from an appointment to his car.\nHeavenly Father can put us in situations with specific intent in mind. He has done so in my life, and He is doing so in yours, as He did in the lives of our dear grandchildren.\nEach of us is precious and loved by the Lord, who cares, who whispers, and who watches over us in ways unique to each of us. He is infinitely wiser and more powerful than mortal men and women. He knows our challenges, our triumphs, and the righteous desires of our hearts.\nOver a year ago, as I was walking through Temple Square, one of the sister missionaries approached me and asked, \u201cDo you remember me? I am from Florida.\u201d She told me her name, Sister Aida Chilan. Yes, I remembered meeting her and her family. Her stake president had suggested we visit her family. It became apparent that we were there for their daughter Aida, who had not been baptized. After our visit and more than a year of teaching and fellowshipping, Aida was baptized.\nAfter we visited on Temple Square, she wrote me a letter. She said: \u201cI know with all my heart that Heavenly Father knows each of us and that He continues to place us in each other\u2019s paths for a reason. Thank you for being one of my missionaries, for reaching out to me and finding me five years ago.\u201d14 Aida also sent me her conversion story recounting the \u201cdivine coincidences\u201d which have taken place in her life that have led to her baptism and confirmation, serving a mission on Temple Square, and her recent temple marriage.15\nWas it a mere coincidence that the stake president had steered us to the Chilan home or that she and I would later meet on Temple Square? Aida\u2019s testimony bears record that this was all part of God\u2019s \u201cdivine design.\u201d\nThe Lord loves to be with us. It is no coincidence that when you are feeling His Spirit and acting on first promptings that you feel Him as He promised: \u201cI will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d16\nWe all have similar things happen in our lives. We may meet someone who seems familiar, renew an acquaintance, or find common ground with a stranger. When those occur, perhaps the Lord is reminding us that we are all truly brothers and sisters. We are really engaged in the same cause\u2014in what Joseph Smith called \u201cthe cause of Christ.\u201d17\nNow, where does our agency fit in a \u201cdivine design\u201d? We have a choice to follow or to not follow our Savior and His chosen leaders. The pattern is clear in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites had turned away from the Lord. Mormon lamented:\n\u201cAnd they saw \u2026 that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples\u2014\n\u201cTherefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness.\u201d18\nNot all that the Lord asks of us is a result of how strong we are, how faithful we are, or what we may know. Think of Saul, whom the Lord stopped on the road to Damascus. He was going the wrong direction in his life, and it had nothing to do with north or south. Saul was divinely redirected. When he was known later as Paul, his apostolic ministry reflected what the Lord already knew he was capable of doing and becoming, not what he had set out to do as Saul. In the same manner, the Lord knows what each of us is capable of doing and becoming. What did the Apostle Paul teach? \u201cAnd we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\u201d19\nWhen we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father\u2019s \u201cdivine design.\u201d Each of us has divinity within us. When we see God working through us and with us, may we be encouraged, even grateful for that guidance. When our Father in Heaven said, \u201cThis is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man,\u201d20 He was talking about all of His children\u2014you in particular.\nThe Lord\u2019s hand is guiding you. By \u201cdivine design,\u201d He is in the small details of your life as well as the major milestones. As it says in Proverbs, \u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; \u2026 and he shall direct thy paths.\u201d21 I testify that He will bless you, sustain you, and bring you peace. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Ronald\u00a0A. Rasband\nBy Divine Design\n2017\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nFeeling the Love of the Lord\n2006\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "On behalf of the Presidency of the Seventy, we welcome with joy Brother Todd Christofferson and Brother Neil Andersen to the ranks of the Seventy. We look forward to serving with you.\nThere have been many inspiring messages given from this Tabernacle pulpit about prayer. Today I add my testimony of the blessing of peace that comes through the miraculous power of prayer.\nAlexandre Dumas, in his classic tale The Count of Monte Cristo, wrote, \u201cFor the happy man prayer is only a jumble of words, until the day when sorrow comes to explain to him the sublime language by means of which he speaks to God.\u201d (Trans. Lowell Bair, New York: Bantam Books, 1981, p. 34.)\nIt was a happy, carefree time in my young life until on such a day, sorrow and tragedy brought me closer to God in humble, sincere prayer. In the summer of my thirteenth year, on a July night, I eagerly joined some neighborhood friends to light fireworks. Five of us took turns igniting the colorful assortment of Roman candles and rockets and firecrackers. Each was a new surprise with its burst of sights and sounds through the evening sky.\nNot all of our fireworks worked as they should have. Most, in fact, were what we called duds. They sputtered momentarily, and then died. We set the duds aside until we had tried to light all of the fireworks. We had so many defective ones remaining, we wondered what to do. We couldn\u2019t just throw them away. What if we emptied the powder from all of them into the cardboard box? We could toss in a match and have one gigantic blast!\nFortunately for us, our idea failed\u2014at first. The match was tossed; we quickly ran away and waited. Nothing happened. Pressing our luck, we tried a second time, using a makeshift fuse of rolled-up newspaper. Again we anxiously waited at a distance. Again, to our good, nothing happened. That is when we should have quit. Foolishly, we gave it one more try; this time my friend Mark and I huddled around the box to keep the flame from being extinguished by the evening breeze.\nThen it happened! The \u201cgigantic blast\u201d we thought we wanted exploded with fury into our faces. The force of the explosion knocked us off our feet, and flames from the ignited powder burned us severely. It was a tragic scene. Responding quickly to the screams and cries of the injured youth in her driveway, our friend\u2019s mother gathered us into her home. \u201cFirst we will pray,\u201d she said, \u201cand then we will call the doctor.\u201d\nThat was the first of many prayers I remember being offered for us. Soon after, I felt my face, hands, and arms being wrapped in bandages. I heard the voices of my father and my doctor administering a priesthood blessing to me. I heard my mother\u2019s voice many times, pleading with Heavenly Father to please let her son see again.\nI had been taught very early in my life to pray. Mother and Father had made prayer an important part of our family life. Not until that day, however, did it become so meaningful to me. In those frightening moments I found peace and comfort through prayer.\nRecently in his own pain and suffering, my friend and associate Elder Clinton Cutler said of his experience, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s peace comes not without pain, but in the midst of pain.\u201d\nOur Father in Heaven has promised us peace in times of trial and has provided a way for us to come to Him in our need. He has given us the privilege and power of prayer. He has told us to \u201cpray always\u201d and has promised He will pour out His Spirit upon us. (D&C 19:38.)\nThankfully, we can call upon Him anytime, anywhere. We can speak to Him in the quiet thoughts of our mind and from the deepest feelings of our heart. It has been said, \u201cprayer is made up of heart throbs and the righteous yearnings of the soul.\u201d (James E. Talmage, Jesus the Christ, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1977, p. 238.) Our Heavenly Father has told us He knows our thoughts and the intents of our hearts. (D&C 6:16.)\nPresident Marion G. Romney taught, \u201cSometimes the Lord puts thoughts in our minds in answer to prayers. \u2026 [He] gives us peace in our minds.\u201d (In Conference Report, Taiwan Area Conference, 1975, p. 7.)\nFor example, in response to Oliver Cowdery\u2019s prayer to know if the translation of the plates by Joseph Smith was true, the Lord answered, \u201cDid I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?\u201d (D&C 6:23.)\nThe peace God speaks to our minds will let us know when decisions we have made are right, when our course is true.\nIt can come as personal inspiration and guidance to assist us in our daily life\u2014in our homes, in our work. It can provide us with courage and hope to meet the challenges of life. The miracle of prayer, to me, is that in the private, quiet chambers of our mind and heart, God both hears and answers prayers.\nPerhaps the greatest test of our faith and the most difficult part of prayer may be to recognize the answer that comes to us in a thought or a feeling, and then to accept or to act on the answer God chooses to give. Consistency in prayer, along with searching the scriptures and following the counsel of living prophets, keeps us in tune with the Lord and enables us to interpret the promptings of the Spirit more easily. The Lord has said; \u201cLearn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.\u201d (D&C 19:23.)\nA few days ago I attended the funeral of a lifelong friend, Ralph Poulsen. He was a righteous man of accomplishment and integrity, yet he had to endure the pain and sorrow inflicted upon him by the consequences of a cruel disease. His dear wife, Joyce, suffered also as she was by his side through his agony and pain. As the days and years of suffering went on, she arrived at a time when she felt she could not handle another day. She had done all she could for him. Now a strength beyond her own was needed. In the depth of her sorrow, she pleaded more fervently to God for His help. With the morning came a blessed peace that filled her whole soul\u2014a peace that has continued with her to this day.\nThere is terrible suffering in our world today. Tragic things happen to good people. God does not cause them, nor does He always prevent them. He does, however, strengthen us and bless us with His peace, through earnest prayer.\n\u201cIt is not the usual purpose of prayer to serve us like Aladdin\u2019s lamp, to bring us ease without effort,\u201d Elder Richard L. Evans wrote. \u201cPrayer is not a matter of asking only. It should not be always as the beggar\u2019s upturned hand. Often the purpose of prayer is to give us strength to do what needs to be done, wisdom to see the way to solve our own problems, and ability to do our best in our tasks.\n\u201cWe need to pray \u2026 for strength to endure, for faith and fortitude to face what sometimes must be faced.\u201d (The Man and the Message, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973, p. 289.)\nIt was the Lord himself who taught us by His own example how to find peace when the answers we receive are not what we asked for. On the eve of His crucifixion, with \u201csoul \u2026 exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,\u201d Jesus knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane and prayed to the Father, saying, \u201cO my Father, if it be possible [and he acknowledged \u2018all things are possible unto thee\u2019], let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\u201d (Matt. 26:38\u201339; see also Mark 14:36.)\nWe can only try to imagine the anguish the Savior felt when we read in the Gospels that He was \u201csore amazed and very heavy\u201d (Mark 14:33), that He \u201cfell on his face\u201d and prayed not once, but a second time, and then a third (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44). \u201cFather, if thou be willing remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\u201d (Luke 22:42.)\nWe cannot imagine the anguish of a loving Father, who, knowing what had to be done, accepted His Beloved Son\u2019s willingness to suffer for all mankind. In this agony Christ was not left alone. As if the Father were saying, \u201cI cannot take it from you, but I can and will send you strength and peace,\u201d \u201cthere appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\u201d (Luke 22:43.)\nIf we, like the Savior, have the faith to put our trust in our Father in Heaven, to submit to His will, the true spirit of peace will come as a witness and strength that He has heard and answered our prayers.\nIf we resist the inspiration of God and turn from His promptings, we are left to our own confusion and lack of peace.\nSometimes, when our prayers are not answered as we desire, we may feel the Lord has rejected us or that our prayer was in vain. We may begin to doubt our worthiness before God, or even the reality and power of prayer. That is when we must continue to pray with patience and faith and to listen for that peace.\nFollowing the incident when I was badly burned, I had felt with a surety that I would be healed. From the moment that first prayer was offered in my friend\u2019s home, I felt a comforting peace. While the doctor treated my burns, I hummed a hymn, finding comfort in these words:\nWhen sore trials came upon you,\nDid you think to pray? \u2026 \nOh, how praying rests the weary!\nPrayer will change the night to day.\nSo, when life gets dark and dreary,\nDon\u2019t forget to pray.\nEach day when the doctor changed my bandages, my mother would ask, \u201cCan he see?\u201d For many days the answer was the same: \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Finally, when all the bandages were permanently removed, my eyesight began to return. I had anticipated that time with anxious expectation. The peace and comfort I had earlier felt gave me assurance that all would be well. However, when my vision cleared enough for me to see my hands and face, I was shocked, unprepared for what I saw. To my terrible disappointment, I found that all was not well. Seeing my scarred and disfigured skin brought great fear and doubt into my mind. I can remember thinking, Nothing can help this skin to be healed\u2014not even the Lord.\nGratefully, as my prayers and the prayers of others continued, I felt the gifts of faith and of peace restored, and then, in time, my eyesight and my skin were healed. My friends who were injured were also blessed with complete recovery.\nMay we always seek to obtain the Lord\u2019s miraculous gift of peace through prayer. May we not forget to pray.\nI join with Alma in saying: \u201cMay the peace of God rest upon you, \u2026 from this time forth and forever.\u201d (Alma 7:27.)\nWith this testimony of peace through prayer, I bear witness of the reality of Jesus Christ and of His Father and of the Holy Ghost, who will lead our lives in the same miraculous way through answers to our prayers of faith. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRex D. Pinegar\nPeace through Prayer\n1993\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Sisters, tonight we are gathered in a general Relief Society meeting. You look wonderful. As we meet, I cannot help but think of that first Relief Society meeting. I imagine in my mind\u2019s eye the Prophet Joseph speaking to the sisters and preparing them for their part in building the kingdom of God. I hear the prayers of the women\u2019s hearts: \u201cI have made covenants to do Thy work, but help me, Lord, to now become an instrument in Thy hands.\u201d Their prayer is our prayer.\nMortality is the time for each one of us to become that instrument.\nI love the message of Sister Lucy Mack Smith, who, frail and failing with age, rose to speak to her sisters in an early Relief Society meeting in Nauvoo. I want you to remember, she is a woman who had been a powerhouse\u2014a great leader. She was very much the kind of woman I see in Relief Society today. But that day she said, \u201cWe must cherish one another, watch over one another, comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together.\u201d1\nThose words speak of the sisters becoming \u201cinstruments in the hands of God.\u201d2 Which one of us does not long to be cherished, watched over, comforted, and instructed in the things of God? How does it happen? One kindness, one expression of love, one thoughtful gesture, one willing hand at a time. But my message is not to those who receive such acts of charity but to all of us who must practice such holiness every day. To become like Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph taught, \u201cyou must enlarge your souls toward others.\u201d3\nAll of us long to possess Christ\u2019s pure love, called charity, but our humanness\u2014the \u201cnatural woman\u201d in us\u2014gets in our way. We get angry, we become frustrated, we berate ourselves and others\u2014and when we do, we cannot be the conduit of love we need to be if we are to become an instrument in Heavenly Father\u2019s hands. Being willing to forgive ourselves and others becomes an integral part of our ability to have the love of the Lord in our lives and to do His work.\nWhen I began preparing this talk, I did all the things I knew I should do: I went to the temple, I fasted, I read the scriptures, I prayed. And I wrote a talk. But, sisters, when you choose to write about charity, you need to feel charitable. And I didn\u2019t. And so, after many prayers and tears, there came a realization to my mind that I had to ask forgiveness of those who, unbeknownst to them, were the cause of my uncharitable thoughts. It was hard. But it was healing. And I testify to you that the Lord\u2019s Spirit returned.\nTo become consistently charitable is a lifelong quest, but each act of love changes us and those who offer it. Let me tell you the story of a young woman I met recently. Alicia, as a teenager, had drifted far from the Church, but later she felt stirrings to return. She often visited her grandfather in a retirement home on Sundays. On one of those days she decided to attend the Latter-day Saint meetings there. She opened the door and found a Relief Society meeting, but no empty seats. As she was about to leave, a woman motioned to her and scooted over to make room for her on her chair. Alicia said: \u201cI wondered what the woman would think of me. I was covered with body piercings, and I smelled of smoke. But she didn\u2019t seem to mind; she simply made a place for me at her side.\u201d\nAlicia, heartened by this woman\u2019s charity, returned to activity. She has served a mission and is now sharing that same kind of love with other women. The elderly sister who shared her chair understood that there is a place for every woman in Relief Society. Sisters, we gather for strength, but we bring with us all our weaknesses and imperfections.\nAlicia told me something I will never forget. She said: \u201cI only do one thing for myself when I go to church: I take the sacrament for me. The rest of the time I watch for others who need me, and I try to help and nurture them.\u201d\nWhen we become instruments in the hands of God, we are used by Him to do His work. Like Alicia, we need to turn to those around us and watch for ways we can nurture and assist. We must think about those at the door looking in and draw them to us\u2014that we may all sit down in heaven together. Not all of us may think there is room for another person on our chair, but there are always chairs to be found if we have love in our hearts.\nIn 1856, Julia and Emily Hill, sisters who had joined the Church as teenagers in England and been disowned by their family, had finally earned passage for their way to America and had almost reached their longed-for Zion. They were crossing the American plains with the Willie handcart company when they and many others were stranded on the trail by an early October storm. Sister Deborah Christensen, a great-granddaughter of Julia Hill, experienced this touching dream about them. She said:\n\u201cI could see Julia and Emily stranded in the snow on the windy summit of Rocky Ridge with the rest of the Willie handcart company. They had no heavy clothing to keep them warm. Julia was sitting in the snow, shaking. She could not carry on. Emily, who was freezing as well, knew that if she did not help Julia stand up, Julia would die. As Emily wrapped her arms around her sister to help her up, Julia began to cry\u2014but no tears came, only soft whimpering sounds. Together they walked slowly to their handcart. Thirteen died that terrible night. Julia and Emily survived.\u201d4\nSisters, without each other, these women probably would not have lived. In addition, they helped others survive this devastating portion of the journey, including a young mother and her children. It was Emily Hill Woodmansee who later wrote the beautiful words to the song \u201cAs Sisters in Zion.\u201d The verse \u201cWe\u2019ll comfort the weary and strengthen the weak\u201d5 takes on new meaning when you imagine her experience on the snow-packed plains.\nAs with the Hill sisters, many of us will not survive our tests in mortality without help from others. And just as true: in helping others we keep our own spirits alive.\nLucy Mack Smith and the sisters of the early Relief Society experienced the pure love of Christ, charity that knows no bounds. They had the truths of the gospel to guide their lives; they had a living prophet; they had a Father in Heaven who listened and answered their prayers. Sisters, so do we. At baptism we took the name of Jesus Christ upon us. We carry that name with us each day, and the Spirit prompts us to live in concert with the Savior\u2019s teachings. As we do, we become instruments in the hands of God. And the Spirit lifts us to higher levels of goodness.\nThe greatest manifestation of charity is the Atonement of Jesus Christ, granted to us as a gift. Our diligent seeking for this gift requires that we not only are willing to receive it but are willing to share it as well. As we share this love with others, we emerge as \u201cinstruments in the hands of God to do this great work.\u201d6 We will be prepared to sit down with our sisters in heaven\u2014together.\nI bear testimony of the Savior, that He lives and that He loves us. He knows what we can become\u2014in spite of our imperfections now. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nKathleen H. Hughes\nThat We May All Sit Down in Heaven Together\n2005\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "The story is told of two outdoor enthusiasts who hired a bush plane to fly them to a remote lake for their annual fishing trip. Following a successful outing, the pilot returned to retrieve them. However, he quickly informed the fishermen that his small plane would not support them, their equipment, and the added weight of the fish they had caught. A second flight would be required.\nNow, the sportsmen were not interested in paying for a second round-trip. So after a promise to pack tightly and a small bonus payment, the pilot reluctantly agreed to attempt the flight.\nThe fishermen grinned knowingly as the pilot forced the aircraft into the air. However, seconds later the plane stalled and crashed into a large, flat swampy area at the end of the lake.\nThe plane had stalled as it flew because of a well-known phenomenon called \u201cground effect.\u201d Ground effect is created when air is compressed between the aircraft\u2019s wings and the earth\u2019s surface\u2014when they are in close proximity. In this case, as the bush plane inched its way upward out of ground effect, it was required to fly on its own power, which it simply could not do.\nFortunately there were no serious injuries, and after regaining their senses, one of the fishermen asked the other, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The second replied, \u201cWe crashed on takeoff\u2014about a hundred yards (91 m) from where we ended up last year!\u201d\nLike the two sportsmen, occasionally we believe that there must be an easier way, a shortcut or modification of the Lord\u2019s commandments that will accommodate our individual circumstances. Thoughts such as these fail to acknowledge that strict obedience to God\u2019s laws brings His blessings and failure to abide by His laws leads to foreseeable consequences.\nAt the time of his appointment as President of the Church, Harold B. Lee said: \u201cThe safety of the Church lies in the members keeping the commandments. \u2026 As they keep the commandments, blessings will come.\u201d1\nWhen we choose to disobey a commandment, it is usually because (1) we have convinced ourselves that the commandment does not apply to us; (2) we do not believe that it is important; or (3) we are certain that it is too difficult to obey.\n1. This Commandment Doesn\u2019t Apply to Me\nDuring the closing years of King Solomon\u2019s reign, the Lord informed him through His prophet, \u201cI will \u2026 rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.\u201d2\nShortly thereafter, the prophet Ahijah identified that servant as Jeroboam, an \u201cindustrious\u201d man whom Solomon had made \u201cruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.\u201d3 Jeroboam\u2019s duties required him to travel from the mountains of Ephraim, where he lived, to the capital of Jerusalem. During one of those trips, Ahijah met him along the road. Through Ahijah, the Lord said, \u201cI will \u2026 give ten tribes to thee.\u201d4 He also instructed Jeroboam, \u201cIf thou wilt \u2026 walk in my ways \u2026 to keep my statutes and my commandments, \u2026 I will be with thee \u2026 and will give Israel unto thee.\u201d5\nAfter hearing of Ahijah\u2019s prophecy, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, so Jeroboam fled to Egypt.6 Upon Solomon\u2019s death Jeroboam returned from exile to the northern part of Israel and began to lead the northern ten tribes.7\nHowever, Jeroboam\u2019s plan to rule the kingdom involved a mixture of good and evil. He established Shechem as the nation\u2019s capital, a city of great religious significance to his people. But sadly he introduced satanic rituals into their worship.8\nJeroboam convinced himself that some of God\u2019s commandments were not applicable to him. As a result of his actions, all of his descendants were slain, and because of the heathen practices he had introduced into their sacred ordinances, the ten tribes of Israel were eventually driven from their inheritance.9\nJust as flying out of ground effect with more weight than an aircraft\u2019s wings can sustain will lead to disastrous consequences, our partial or selective compliance with God\u2019s laws will fail to bring the full blessings of obedience.\n2. This Commandment Is Not Important\nDecades later Naaman, a Syrian war hero, \u201ca mighty man in valour,\u201d10 traveled from his native country to Israel and approached the king, Jehoram, to be healed of leprosy.11\nNaaman was directed to the prophet Elisha. \u201cAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, \u2026 and thou shalt be clean.\u201d12\nDespite this prophetic promise to be cured, Naaman was offended that Elisha did not greet him in person and even more insulted with the prophet\u2019s direction to wash seven times in the small and muddy Jordan River. His pride demanded something more noteworthy and grand, something matching his stature and place in the community and nation.\nFortunately for Naaman, his servants convinced him that regardless of what the prophet asked him to do, if obeyed, it would bring the Lord\u2019s blessings. Naaman washed himself in the Jordan River as directed and, as a result of his obedience, was cured of his leprosy.13\nObedience to the Lord\u2019s commands, in spite of how trivial or unimportant we believe them to be, will surely bring His promised blessings.\n3. This Commandment Is Just Too Hard\nFollowing the Lord\u2019s command, the prophet Lehi led his family into the wilderness. During the first few days of the journey, Lehi instructed his son Lemuel to be \u201cfirm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!\u201d14\nHowever, when the prophetic requirement came to return to Jerusalem to retrieve the brass plates, containing a \u201crecord of the Jews,\u201d15 the two oldest boys rebelled, saying, \u201cIt is a hard thing.\u201d16\nDespite his older brothers\u2019 murmuring, Nephi\u2019s faith in and obedience to the Lord\u2019s commands led to obtaining those brass plates. A nation was built, a language was preserved, and the gospel of Jesus Christ was taught for generations to come.\nAt times we may rationalize that the Lord will understand our disobedience because our special circumstances make adherence to His laws difficult, embarrassing, or even painful. However, faithful obedience, regardless of the apparent size of the task, will bring the Lord\u2019s guidance, assistance, and peace.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith petitioned the Lord on two occasions, asking if a prominent friend, Martin Harris, could take the first 116 handwritten pages of translated material from the book of Lehi from Harmony, Pennsylvania, back to Palmyra. Each time, the Lord counseled Joseph to avoid entrusting the manuscript to Mr. Harris.\nMartin was seeking to use the translated material as evidence to stop his associates from spreading rumors about his friendship with Joseph Smith. On the third request the Lord granted Joseph\u2019s appeal.17\nMartin lost the manuscript, and as a result the plates were taken from the Prophet Joseph Smith for an extended period. This was a painful lesson for the Prophet Joseph, who said, \u201cI made this my rule: When the Lord commands, do it.\u201d18 This should and can be our rule as well.\nThe Lord\u2019s response when we obey His commandments is sure. He has promised us, \u201cIf you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life.\u201d19\nAdditionally He has counseled us, \u201cI, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.\u201d20\nObedience to the Lord\u2019s commandments provides us confidence in our chosen path, qualifies us for His guidance and direction as we pursue our efforts, and offers us the potential to become like our Savior, Jesus Christ, and return to our Father\u2019s presence.\nIt is my prayer that each day will find us striving to be more obedient to the laws, ordinances, and commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ in order that He may more fully bless our lives.\nI testify that obedience to God\u2019s commands brings the blessings of heaven; that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, live; that the Book of Mormon is the word of God; and that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord\u2019s prophet for our day, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBruce A. Carlson\nWhen the Lord Commands\n2010\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "This year we are commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. To the world we testify that he was the prophet of God foreordained to bring about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This he did under the direction of our Savior, who said to an earlier prophet, \u201cMy name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee.\u201d1\nI acknowledge the Lord\u2019s hand in the Restoration of the gospel. Through the inspired sacrifices of God\u2019s children through the ages, the foundation of the Restoration was laid, and the world is preparing for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\nHis gospel was first established on the earth beginning with Adam and has been taught in every dispensation through such prophets as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others. Each of these prophets foretold the coming of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world. Those prophecies have been fulfilled. The Savior did establish His Church. He called His Apostles and established His priesthood. Most importantly, He laid down His life and took it up that all will rise again, thus carrying out the atoning sacrifice. But that was not the end.\nAfter the Savior\u2019s Resurrection, He commissioned His Apostles to lead the Church and administer gospel ordinances. Faithful to this charge, they were persecuted, and some were eventually martyred. As a result, the Lord\u2019s priesthood authority was no longer on earth, and the world fell into spiritual darkness. In the centuries that followed, God\u2019s children had the Light of Christ, could pray, and could feel the influence of the Holy Ghost. But the fulness of the gospel had been lost. There was no one left on earth with the power and authority to lead the Church or perform sacred ordinances such as baptism, conferral of the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the saving ordinances of the temple. Almost everyone was denied access to the scriptures, and most people were illiterate.\nMaking the scriptures available and helping God\u2019s children learn to read them was the first step to the Restoration of the gospel. Originally the Bible was written in Hebrew and Greek, languages unknown to common people throughout Europe. Then, about 400 years after the Savior\u2019s death, the Bible was translated by Jerome into Latin. But still the scriptures were not widely available. Copies had to be written by hand, usually by monks, each taking years to complete.\nThen, through the influence of the Holy Ghost, an interest in learning began to grow in the hearts of people. This Renaissance or \u201crebirth\u201d spread throughout Europe. In the late 1300s, a priest named John Wycliffe initiated a translation of the Bible from Latin into English. Because English was then an emerging, unrefined language, church leaders deemed it unsuitable to convey God\u2019s word. Some leaders were certain that if people could read and interpret the Bible for themselves, its doctrine would be corrupted; others feared that people with independent access to the scriptures would not need the church and would cease to support it financially. Consequently, Wycliffe was denounced as a heretic and treated accordingly. After he died and was buried, his bones were dug up and burned. But God\u2019s work could not be stopped.\nWhile some were inspired to translate the Bible, others were inspired to prepare the means to publish it. By 1455 Johannes Gutenberg had invented a press with movable type, and the Bible was one of the first books he printed. For the first time it was possible to print multiple copies of the scriptures and at a cost many could afford.\nMeanwhile, the inspiration of God also rested upon explorers. In 1492 Christopher Columbus set out to find a new path to the Far East. Columbus was led by the hand of God in his journey. He said, \u201cGod gave me the faith, and afterwards the courage.\u201d2\nThese inventions and discoveries set the stage for further contributions. In the early 1500s young William Tyndale enrolled at Oxford University. There he studied the work of the Bible scholar Erasmus, who believed that the scriptures are \u201cthe food of [a man\u2019s] soul; and \u2026 must permeate the very depths of [his] heart and mind.\u201d3 Through his studies, Tyndale developed a love for God\u2019s word and a desire that all God\u2019s children be able to feast on it for themselves.\nAt about this time, a German priest and professor named Martin Luther identified 95 points of error in the church of his day, which he boldly sent in a letter to his superiors. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli printed 67 articles of reform. John Calvin in Switzerland, John Knox in Scotland, and many others assisted in this effort. A reformation had begun.\nMeanwhile, William Tyndale had become a trained priest and was fluent in eight languages. He believed a direct translation from Greek and Hebrew into English would be more accurate and readable than Wycliffe\u2019s translation from Latin. So Tyndale, enlightened by the Spirit of God, translated the New Testament and a portion of the Old Testament. His friends warned him that he would be killed for doing so, but he was undaunted. Once, while disputing with a learned man, he said, \u201cIf God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.\u201d4\nEventually Tyndale, like others, was killed for his efforts\u2014strangled and burned at the stake near Brussels. But the belief for which he gave his life was not lost. Millions have come to experience for themselves what Tyndale taught throughout his life: \u201cThe nature of God\u2019s word is, that whosoever read it, \u2026 it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better, till he be grown into a perfect man.\u201d5\nTurbulent political times brought change. Because of a disagreement with the church in Rome, King Henry VIII declared himself the head of the church in England and required that copies of the English Bible be placed in every parish church. Hungry for the gospel, people flocked to these churches, reading the scriptures to one another until their voices gave out. The Bible was also used as a primer to teach reading. Though martyrdoms continued across Europe, the dark night of ignorance was coming to an end. Declared one preacher before being burned, \u201cWe shall this day light such a candle, by God\u2019s Grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\u201d6\nWe express gratitude to all who lived in England and throughout Europe who helped kindle that light. By God\u2019s grace, the light grew brighter. Aware of the divisions within his own country, English King James I agreed to a new official version of the Bible. It has been estimated that over 80 percent of William Tyndale\u2019s translations of the New Testament and a good portion of the Old Testament (the Pentateuch, or Genesis through Deuteronomy, and Joshua through Chronicles) were retained in the King James Version.7 In time, that version would find its way to a new land and be read by a 14-year-old plowboy named Joseph Smith. Is it any wonder that the King James Version is the approved English Bible of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today?\nReligious persecution in England continued under James\u2019s son Charles, and many were prompted to seek freedom in new lands. Among them were the Pilgrims, who landed in the Americas in 1620, the very part of the world Columbus had explored over 100 years earlier. Other colonists soon followed, including those like Roger Williams, founder and later governor of Rhode Island, who continued to search for Christ\u2019s true Church. Williams said that there was no regularly constituted church of Christ on earth, nor any person authorized to administer any church ordinance, nor could there be until new Apostles were sent by the great Head of the church, for whose coming he was seeking.8\nOver a century later, such religious feeling guided founders of a new nation on the American continent. Under God\u2019s hand, they secured religious freedom for every citizen with an inspired Bill of Rights. Fourteen years later, on December 23, 1805, the Prophet Joseph Smith was born. The preparation was nearing its completion for the Restoration.\nAs a young man, Joseph \u201cwas called up to serious reflection\u201d9 on the subject of religion. Because he was born in a land of religious freedom, he could question which of all the churches was right. And because the Bible had been translated into English, he could seek an answer from the word of God. He read in the book of James, \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,\u201d10 and he did as directed. In answer to Joseph\u2019s prayer, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him.11 This humble farm boy was the prophet chosen by God to restore the ancient Church of Jesus Christ and His priesthood in these latter days. This restoration was to be the last, the dispensation of the fulness of times, restoring all the priesthood blessings which man could possess on earth. With this divine commission, his work was not to reform nor was it to protest what was already on the earth. It was to restore what had been on earth and had been lost.\nThe Restoration, begun with the First Vision in 1820, continued with the coming forth of the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. On September 21, 1823, Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni, who taught him of an ancient record containing \u201cthe fulness of the everlasting gospel \u2026 preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.\u201d12 Recorded on plates of gold, the Book of Mormon gives an account of Christ\u2019s ministry in the Western Hemisphere, just as the Bible records His life and ministry in the Holy Land. Joseph received the gold plates four years later and, in December of 1827, began to translate the Book of Mormon.13\nWhile translating, Joseph Smith and his scribe Oliver Cowdery read about baptism. Their desire to receive this blessing for themselves prompted the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood on May 15, 1829, under the hands of John the Baptist.14\nThere followed the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood, which was bestowed on Joseph and Oliver by the Apostles Peter, James, and John, who held the keys. After centuries of spiritual darkness, the power and authority to act in God\u2019s name, to perform sacred ordinances, and to lead His Church were once again upon the earth.\nThe first printed copies of the Book of Mormon were published on March 26, 1830. A few days later, on April 6, Christ\u2019s true Church in these latter days was once again organized, at the home of Peter Whitmer Sr. in Fayette, New York. Describing the effects of these events upon the world, Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote:\nThe morning breaks, the shadows flee;\nLo, Zion\u2019s standard is unfurled!\nThe dawning of a brighter day, \u2026 \nMajestic rises on the world.15\nThe long night was finally over, and revelation streamed forth, resulting in additional scripture. The Doctrine and Covenants was accepted by the Church on August 17, 1835. The Pearl of Great Price translation of the book of Abraham also began in that year.\nFurther authority to act in the name of the Lord soon followed. The Kirtland Temple was dedicated on March 27, 1836.16 In that temple, the Savior appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, followed by the appearances of Moses, Elias, and Elijah, who gave additional priesthood keys to the Prophet.17\nThis gospel light would never again be taken from the earth. In 1844 Joseph Smith conferred all the keys of the priesthood upon Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and their fellow Apostles. The Prophet said: \u201cI have lived until I have seen this burden, which has rested on my shoulders, rolled on to the shoulders of other men; \u2026 the keys of the kingdom are planted on the earth to be taken away no more for ever. \u2026 No matter what becomes of me.\u201d18 Sadly, three months later, on June 27, Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were martyred at Carthage, Illinois.\nElder John Taylor, who was with the Prophet when he was martyred, testified of him, \u201cJoseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.\u201d19\nI testify that the work of the Prophet Joseph Smith is the Savior\u2019s work. In the Lord\u2019s service the path is not always easy. It often requires sacrifices, and we will likely experience adversity. But in serving Him, we discover that His hand is truly over us. So it was for Wycliffe, Tyndale, and thousands of others who prepared the way for the Restoration. So it was for the Prophet Joseph Smith and all who helped usher in the restored gospel. So it is and will be for us.\nThe Lord expects us to be as faithful, as devoted, as courageous as those who went before us. They were called to give their lives for the gospel. We are called to live our lives for the same purpose. In these last days we have special reason to do so.\nBefore that sacred night in Bethlehem, the events of history and the words of the prophets of all dispensations prepared the way for the first coming of the Lord and His Atonement. Similarly, history and prophecy laid the groundwork for the Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Do we have eyes to see that the events and prophecies of our time are preparing us for the Savior\u2019s Second Coming?\nI bear special witness that our Savior Jesus Christ lives. I testify that His hand has been over the work of the Restoration from before the foundation of this world and will continue until His Second Coming.\nThat each of us will prepare ourselves to greet Him is my humble prayer. In His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.\nRobert D. Hales\nPreparations for the Restoration and the Second Coming:\u201cMy Hand Shall Be over Thee\u201d\n2005\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "On Friday morning, President Hinckley called me to serve as a counselor to Bishop Hales in the Presiding Bishopric. I am grateful for the call and for the knowledge that it is the Savior who makes such calls through his servants in his Church. And I am grateful for your sustaining vote, which surely must stem from your conviction that God issued that call.\nDuring the meetings yesterday, I was overwhelmed in two ways by the reaction of the General Authorities. First, they expressed love and confidence, which I deeply appreciate. But second, I felt, in addition to that same love from Bishops Brown, Peterson, and Clarke, an added expression of almost solicitude. I realized they knew what was ahead of me, and I sensed they might know the growing feeling in my heart that I was overwhelmed by the task ahead. As that feeling increased, I began to think more and more of me. But then I remembered that, in the past few weeks, a deacon has come home with the rolls to announce he was the new quorum secretary; a teacher has been called to preside in his quorum; a mother has been called to be a counselor in a Relief Society presidency; and a nineteen-year-old boy has been called to go to a new city with a new missionary companion. To each of them, and to each of you, fear of failure might try to poke its head in, as it has with me.\nSomething happened to me yesterday afternoon that I found of great help to me, and it may be of help to you. Since that moment, the fear has gone. It was when Bishop Hales was speaking in conference. He mentioned that we had known each other since boyhood, and as he did a memory was replayed in my mind. It was of a hotel ballroom in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Bishop Hales was likely not there, since he lived in what seemed to us the well-established stake in New York. We were in the New Jersey District, a single district that covered the whole state. The Princeton Branch met in my parents\u2019 dining room. Dad was the branch president. Mother was both the pianist and chorister (which is hard to do if you think about it). There was not another family in the branch with children, so my brother Ted was the Aaronic Priesthood, and my brother, Harden, and I were all there were of Primary and junior Sunday School. The congregations were young students who happened to be there, like Jim Fletcher and Neil Zundle, and a few older converts\u2014none with spouses that were members.\nThere was no building, no gym, no stake center, and so we traveled to a hotel ballroom for what must have been a district conference. I was sitting on a folding chair somewhere near the back, next to my mother. I must have been very young because I can remember putting my legs through the back of the chair and sitting aft instead of forward. But then I remember hearing something\u2014a man\u2019s voice from the pulpit. I turned around and looked. I still remember that the speaker was at a rostrum set on wooden risers. There was a tall window behind him. He was the priesthood visitor. I don\u2019t know who he was, but he was tall and bald, and he seemed very old to me.\nHe must have been talking about the Savior or the Prophet Joseph, or both, because that was all that I remember much of hearing in those days. But as he spoke, I knew that what he said came from God and that it was true, and it burned in my heart. That was before scholars told me how hard it was to know. I just knew of certainty\u2014I knew it was true. And when I listened to Bishop Hales yesterday, I knew that what he was saying was from God and that it was true, and then the fear left.\nYou can have that same confidence, not of yourself, but from God. He lives, and he communicates with his children. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, and he leads it. No assignment in it need ever overwhelm you if you know that and listen for the Master\u2019s voice.\nNow I can hear the young deacons saying, \u201cWell, now, that may be fine for you, but surely you don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help me in my assignment down here in this deacons quorum.\u201d Oh yes, I do. Between being a high councilor and a member of the General Board of the Sunday School, I was a deacons quorum adviser. A boy, the president, presided in the meetings, and I taught the lessons out of the scriptures and out of the manual. I stayed very close to the lessons as they were outlined.\nI remember one boy in the quorum had to miss a few meetings, and so he sent his brother to the class with a tape recorder. His brother recorded our meeting and took it home. It happened more than once. When the deacon came back, I asked him why. I don\u2019t remember his words, but I remember that it was clear he knew what I knew. God was trying to speak to that deacons quorum. The boy wasn\u2019t anxious to have a tape recording to hear me; he was trying to hear God. He knew where to listen and how to hear.\nHe\u2019d read the scriptures for us in class, and I knew he knew them and loved them. And so, even when I wasn\u2019t teaching very well, by the power of the Holy Ghost and from knowing the Master\u2019s voice in the scriptures, he could hear what he needed to hear. The memory of that black recorder with its tape turning will always remind me of the scripture which says, \u201cHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\u201d (Matt. 11:15.)\nI spoke at his funeral just a few years later. He lived about as many years as the Prophet Joseph had lived when he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in the grove. My deacon hadn\u2019t seen a vision, but he had heard the voice of God through his servants in a deacons quorum. He wanted to hear, he knew how, and he had the faith he could. Like the boy prophet Joseph, he knew the heavens were open.\nYou and I can take confidence in that assurance. If you and I will study the scriptures and pray and tune our hearts and ears, we will hear the voice of God in the voice of the people that he has sent to teach and guide us and direct us. I heard it yesterday as I listened to Bishop Hales, and I heard it last evening in the priesthood session as I listened to the recorded voice of President Kimball, a prophet of God. You and I can take confidence in that assurance for the Church itself. However large the kingdom will grow (and it will fill the earth), you will not ever feel lost or forgotten, and you need never feel overwhelmed. God will call people to care about you and to teach you. And if you will listen and hear the voice of God, the kingdom will roll forth to its appointed place, ready for the coming of the Master.\nNone of us can see now all the wonders of technology and organization and buildings that God may give us; but you, just you, hearing the voice of God through your teacher and leader, will always be at its heart.\nI\u2019m grateful for the gift given to me of ears to hear. One of my great-grandfathers, John Bennion, walked or rode his horse from over Jordan to this place to hear his name called out to go on a mission to Dixie. His journal doesn\u2019t say much, except just that the next day he prepared to go, and he went. His assignment was to be a sheepherder. In his journal there is a record of an evening in which he met with Erastus Snow. He said another man was in the room; his name was Henry Eyring. And somewhere in St. George that night was Bishop Miles Romney. They talked about sheep. And you might have thought they were talking about something temporal. But not to those men, because they knew they were God\u2019s sheep, and they knew they were for God\u2019s people. And they knew how to listen, and they knew how to do what they heard.\nJohn Bennion went on another mission to Wales and back again to this valley. Henry Eyring went on to Colonia Juarez, as Miles Romney did. And they left for me a tradition which I deeply appreciate. They were the yeomen of the Church, the soldiers of the Church, and my great-grandfathers. You can\u2019t find in their journals records of the positions they held, just of the instructions they heard, and knew were from God, and followed. I\u2019m grateful to my parents who handed me that heritage undiminished. I\u2019m grateful to my wife, who more than once has heard when I did not and gently said, \u201cWould you pray about it?\u201d If my sons and daughters will listen to her, and hear through her what God has in mind for them, we will pass the heritage on again.\nGod lives, Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith in fact saw God and His Son and received all the keys of the priesthood. And President Kimball holds them today. I testify that God loves his children and can tell us what is true. I pray that we all may have ears to hear, that he may guide us. I pray that I may serve you and him, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nHenry B. Eyring\nEars to Hear\n1985\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": ""}, {"text": "There are times in our struggle with the adversities of mortality when we become weary, weakened, and susceptible to the temptations that seem to be placed in our pathways. A lesson for us lies in the account of the life of the Savior.\nSoon after his baptism Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wild, uncultivated wilderness. There he remained for forty days and nights, preparing himself for the formal ministry which was then to begin. The greatest task ever to be accomplished in this world lay before him, and he needed divine strength. Throughout these days in the wilderness he chose to fast, that his mortal body might be completely subjected to the divine influence of his Father\u2019s Spirit.\nWhen Jesus had completed the fast of forty days and had communed with God, he was, in this hungry and physically weakened state, left to be tempted of the devil. That, too, was to be part of his preparation. Such a time is always the tempter\u2019s moment\u2014when we are emotionally or physically spent, when we are weary, vulnerable, and least prepared to resist the insidious suggestions he makes. This was an hour of danger\u2014the kind of moment in which many men fall and succumb to the subtle allurement of the devil.\nSatan\u2019s first temptation was to entice Jesus to satisfy his craving for food, that most basic, physical, biological need. It was a temptation of the senses, an appeal to appetite, and in many ways the most common and most dangerous of the devil\u2019s allurements. \u201cIf thou be the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201ccommand that these stones be made bread.\u201d (Matt. 4:3.) During the long weeks of seclusion, the Savior had been sustained by the exaltation of spirit that would naturally accompany such meditation, prayer, and communion with the heavens. In such a devoted spirit, bodily appetites were subdued and superceded, but now the demands of the flesh were inevitable.\nSatan was not simply tempting Jesus to eat. Had he suggested, \u201cGo down out of this wilderness and obtain food from the bread maker,\u201d there would have been no temptation because undoubtedly Jesus intended to eat at the close of his fast. Satan\u2019s temptation was to have him eat in a spectacular way\u2014using his divine powers for selfish purposes. The temptation was in the invitation to turn stones into bread miraculously, instantaneously, without waiting or postponing physical gratification. His reply to the tempter was crystal clear: \u201cIt is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d (Matt. 4:4.)\nThen followed the second temptation. Realizing that he had utterly failed in his attempt to induce Jesus to use his divine powers for personal, physical gratification and having seen Jesus defer totally to the will and spirit of his Father\u2019s sustenance, Satan went to the other extreme and tempted Jesus to wantonly throw himself upon the Father\u2019s protection. He took Jesus into the Holy City, to the pinnacle of the temple overlooking the spacious courts and people below, and quoted scripture:\n\u201cIf thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\u201d (Matt. 4:6; see also Ps. 91:11\u201312.)\nThere lurked in this appeal from Satan another temptation of the human side of mortal nature\u2014the temptation to perform some dazzling feat, some astounding exploit which might bring crowds of amazed and attentive onlookers. Surely leaping from the dizzy heights of the temple turret and landing in the courtyard unhurt would be such a feat. This would be public recognition that Jesus was a superior being and did have a message from on high. It would be a sign and a wonder, the fame of which would spread like wildfire throughout all Judaea and cause many to believe that the Messiah had indeed come. But faith is to precede the miracle; miracles are not to precede the faith. Jesus, of course, answered scripture for scripture by replying, \u201cIt is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\u201d (Matt. 4:7; see also Deut. 6:16.) Once more the purposes of Satan were thwarted and Christ became the victor.\nIn his third temptation, the devil casts away all subtlety and scripture and all deviousness and disguise. Now he staked everything on a blunt, bold proposition. From a high mountain he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them\u2014the cities, the fields, the flocks, the herds, and everything nature could offer. Though they were not his to give, Satan offered them all to Jesus\u2014to him who had lived as a modest village carpenter.\nWith wealth, splendor, and earthly glory spread before them, Satan said unto him, \u201cAll these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\u201d (Matt. 4:9.) In a final ploy Satan was falling back on one of his false but fundamental propositions, one which resulted in his leading one-third of the hosts from heaven and continues to direct his miserable efforts against the children of men here on earth. It is the proposition that everyone has a price, that material things finally matter most, that ultimately you can buy anything in this world for money.\nJesus knew that if he were faithful to his Father and obedient to every commandment, he would inherit \u201call that [the] Father hath\u201d (D&C 84:38)\u2014and so would any other son or daughter of God. The surest way to lose the blessings of time or eternity is to accept them on Satan\u2019s terms. Lucifer seemed to have forgotten that this was the Man who would later preach, \u201cFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d\n\u201cOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d (Mark 8:36\u201337.)\nIn power and dignity, Jesus commanded, \u201cGet thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\u201d (Matt. 4:10.) Anguished and defeated Satan turned and went away. \u201cAnd when the devil had ended all the temptation,\u201d Luke adds, \u201che departed from him for a season.\u201d (Luke 4:13.) Matthew tells us that \u201cangels came and ministered unto him.\u201d (Matt. 4:11.)\nAs with Jesus, so with us, relief comes and miracles are enjoyed after the trial and temptation of our faith. There is, of course, running through all of these temptations, Satan\u2019s insidious suggestion that Jesus was not the Son of God, the doubt implied in the tempter\u2019s repeated use of the word if. \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\u201d (Matt. 4:3.) \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down.\u201d (Matt. 4:6.) These, of course, were foreshadows of that final, desperate temptation which would come three years later: \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\u201d (Matt. 27:40.) But Jesus patiently withstood that ploy also, knowing in due time every knee would bow and every tongue confess.\nIt was not necessary then, or ever, for Jesus to satisfy the curiosity of men, least of all unholy men. So as victory in every encounter came to Jesus, the pathos and tragedy of Lucifer\u2019s life is even more obvious: First bold and taunting and tempting; then pleading and weak and desperate; finally, and ultimately, simple banishment.\nThe question for us now is\u2014will we succeed? Will we resist? Will we wear the victor\u2019s crown? Satan may have lost Jesus, but he does not believe he has lost us. He continues to tempt, taunt, and plead for our loyalty. We should take strength for this battle from the fact that Christ was victorious not as a God but as a man.\nIt is important to remember that Jesus was capable of sinning, that he could have succumbed, that the plan of life and salvation could have been foiled, but that he remained true. Had there been no possibility of his yielding to the enticement of Satan, there would have been no real test, no genuine victory in the result. If he had been stripped of the faculty to sin, he would have been stripped of his very agency. It was he who had come to safeguard and ensure the agency of man. He had to retain the capacity and ability to sin had he willed so to do. As Paul wrote, \u201cThough he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered\u201d (Heb. 5:8); and he \u201cwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin\u201d (Heb. 4:15). He was perfect and sinless, not because he had to be, but rather because he clearly and determinedly wanted to be. As the Doctrine and Covenants records, \u201cHe suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.\u201d (D&C 20:22.)\nWhat about us? We live in a world of temptation\u2014temptation that seems more real and oppressively rampant than any since the days of Noah. Are we remaining faithful in such a world? Every individual in this church should ask himself, \u201cAm I living so that I am keeping unspotted from the evils of the world?\u201d\nIn speaking of the three temptations that came to Jesus, a former President of the Church made this statement concerning them: \u201cClassify them, and you will find that under one of those three nearly every given temptation that makes you and me spotted, ever so little maybe, comes to us as (1) a temptation of the appetite; (2) a yielding to the pride and fashion and vanity of those alienated from the things of God; or (3) a gratifying of the passion, or a desire for the riches of the world, or power among men.\u201d And then he said: \u201cNow, when do temptations come? Why, they come to us in our social gatherings, they come to us at our weddings, they come to us in our politics, they come to us in our business relations, on the farm, in the mercantile establishment, in our dealings in all the affairs of life, we find these insidious influences working, and it is when they manifest themselves to the consciousness of each individual that the defense of truth ought to exert itself.\u201d (David O. McKay, Conference Report, Oct. 1911, p. 59.)\nIs it just for an individual, or can a body of people withstand the temptations of Satan? Surely the Lord would be pleased with the Saints if they stood before the world as a light that cannot be hidden because they are willing to live the principles of the gospel and keep the commandments of the Lord.\nWith faith, and prayer, and humility, and sources of strength from an eternal world, we are able to live unspotted in the midst of a world of temptation. With the Psalmist we will sing:\n\u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\n\u201cThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\n\u201cSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\u201d (Ps. 23:4\u20136.)\nMay this be our destiny, I pray in the name of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Amen.\nHoward W. Hunter\nThe Temptations of Christ\n1976\nFriday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, I would talk tonight to the generation who are moving into their mature years, many of whom have served God, country, and fellowman\u2014a strong, principled, and committed generation, which did great things but had the wisdom not to talk about them much. There is another need for us now.\nThe cause to which I speak is of missionary work as couples. It was of such great consequence that the Savior, in his final instructions to his disciples, charges them with it: \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. \u2026 I have chosen you \u2026 that ye should go \u2026 and that your fruit should remain.\u201d (John 15:13, 16.)\nThere has never been a greater need than now for an army of mature couples to go out into every far corner of this earth and retain the fruit of the harvest. The harvest is truly great, and the laborers are few. Remember the words of Ammon:\n\u201cOur brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.\u201d (Alma 26:3.)\nImagine what thousands of couples could do this year, followed by hosts more in succeeding years. We could move into the fields of harvest, and we could nurture, care for, and gather them \u201cinto the garners, that they are not wasted. Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day.\u201d (Alma 26:5\u20136.)\nI think we will not be tested in the way the pioneers were tested. They were called to leave all worldly possessions, homes, even family and loved ones, to cross the prairies to dry and desolate, forbidding lands. They buried their babies, children, and companions on the Great Plains in shallow, unmarked graves. Physically, they suffered beyond belief, nor can tongue tell the sad, pitiful story. Out of the ashes of sacrifice of so noble a people this kingdom has emerged to become the most powerful force for good on the face of the earth today.\nThere is a need\u2014not to leave homes forever, but for a time\u2014then return and reap the rich harvest of the faithful labor. Your children and grandchildren will be blessed. The power of good will go out from Zion. \u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace.\u201d (Mosiah 12:21.)\nCan you imagine any more Christlike service than to secure the harvest?\nMissionary couples are sent into the branches to minister and nurture. They strengthen the Church, lift up the hands that hang down, and fall in love with the Filipinos, the Africans, the Norwegians, Haitians, and Polynesians.\nImagine what it means to be truly needed by the Lord in a far ministry.\nThere was a popular song that our generation may remember. Review the slightly adjusted lyrics with me:\nAway from home tonight you\u2019ll find me,\nToo weak to break the chains that bind me;\nI need no shackles to remind me\nI\u2019m just a prisoner of love.\nFor one command I stand and wait now\nFrom one who\u2019s master of my fate now.\nI can\u2019t escape for it\u2019s too late now;\nI\u2019m just a prisoner of love.\nWhat\u2019s the good of my caring,\nUnless I am sharing his love for me;\nAlthough there may be others,\nI must be a brother, for I\u2019m not free.\nHe\u2019s in my dreams, awake or sleeping.\nUpon my knees to him I\u2019m creeping,\nMy very life is in his keeping.\nI\u2019m just a prisoner of love.\nI am a prisoner of love.\nRen\u00e9 de Chardin said, \u201cSomeday, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity, we will harness for God the energies of love: and then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.\u201d\nWonderful couples who simply love the Lord and will enlist in this great work and accept a call will also be prisoners of love, His love.\nYogi Berra, an oft-quoted baseball philosopher, said; \u201cWhen you come to a crossroads \u2026 take it.\u201d Thousands of you may have reached a crossroads.\nNow is the time to accept a call or volunteer for one.\nA little old lady at a rest home turned to the old man next to her and said, \u201cI can guess your age.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go take a bath, shave, brush your hair, put on a nice clean shirt and a tie, and shine your shoes, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\nThe old man was gone for about an hour. When he returned he was neat, clean, hair brushed, shoes polished, and in his suit. She said, \u201cNow you go stand up against the wall.\u201d He did.\nHe said, \u201cNow, how old am I?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019re 89.\u201d\nHe responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, but how did you know?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou told me yesterday.\u201d\nAfter examining a woman\u2019s husband, the doctor said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the looks of your husband.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said the woman, \u201cbut he is good to the children.\u201d Some of us may look a little old, but if we get all dressed up we don\u2019t look half bad.\nYou can imagine what a wonderful blessing it would be to serve in a branch in Alaska, Barbados, Haiti, Nigeria, or Manila. We need couples filled with love and a desire to serve, whose chief responsibility is to bless the harvest so that the fruit will remain. Experience alone from a mature life qualifies us to become nurturers.\nThanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s will never be the same again once you have celebrated them while serving a mission. Imagine a small Christmas tree with a few decorations, Christmas carols, a humble apartment, never more in love with your wife\u2014a Christmas spirit that makes that little apartment seem as a sacred temple. You pack your white baptismal clothing and walk, hand in hand, to the chapel, where a little family waits patiently to enter God\u2019s kingdom through the waters of baptism. You see the star of wonder, not hanging over Bethlehem, but in the eyes of the humble, sweet converts. You look at your wife, she looks at you; nothing need or can be said, both of you overcome with joy.\nThe twelve or eighteen months will seem as a small moment, but the memories will last through the eternities.\nThose of us who have partaken of the goodness of God have a divine charge to share.\nThe Apostle Paul asked the Ephesians \u201cto know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.\u201d (Eph. 3:19.) We should be filled with all the fulness of God.\nWe ask along with James, \u201cWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?\u201d (James 2:14.)\nAnd in the last verse of the book of James, the Apostle gives us a key to our service. \u201cLet him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\u201d (James 5:20.) Should the reward be less for the nurturer, the garnerer, the carer?\nPresident Harold B. Lee taught the principle that only as we make ourselves totally available are we worthy disciples of Christ and obtain another promise that reaches beyond us. We worry and ache and pain over family members who have erred. The thirty-first section of the Doctrine and Covenants provides a great key in verse five:\n\u201cTherefore, thrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are forgiven you, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.\u201d [D&C 31:5]\nOurs has been a giving generation. Why not one more time, that our families should live?\nWe do not know the blessings or condescensions of God. The promise is sure, \u201cWherefore, your family shall live.\u201d Blessings will come to our wayward or wandering children, even those who are married and have children of their own.\nOur generation came through a depression, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. We live in the season of the world when good has become evil and evil, good. We have heard outcries against the things which we hold precious and dear\u2014prayer and God. We see attempts at legalization of drugs, abortion, homosexuality, and other compromising, drifting philosophies. Some of the brightest in our generation have been swept by giant waves onto treacherous shoals. We may not have been all that we should have been as parents, but we have loved our children, this church, our homelands, and cared for people in all nations. Some of the best blood of our generation has been spilled to preserve freedom. We have sacrificed many things to provide those who would follow better things than we had. This may well be another opportunity to reach our own by serving others.\nPresident Joseph F. Smith said:\n\u201cAfter we have done all we could do for the cause of truth, and withstood the evil that men have brought upon us, \u2026 it is still our duty to stand. We cannot give up; we must not lie down. Great causes are not won in a single generation. To stand firm in the face of overwhelming opposition, when you have done all you can, is the courage of faith. The courage of faith is the courage of progress. Men who possess that divine quality go on; they are not permitted to stand still if they would. They are not simply the creatures of their own power and wisdom; they are instrumentalities of a higher law and a divine purpose.\u201d (Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 119.)\nThere is a holy hand behind the divine purposes of God. We can be His \u201cinstrumentalities.\u201d\nMost of us do not have many years left to live. As we come to the latter years of life, we come to a mature spiritual understanding. We have these next years to do something great, important and significant for God, our religion, our wives, and children. We ought to raise a new title, not a title of liberty, but of love\u2014a banner that will remain long after we are gone.\nWhat better way have we to prepare to meet our God than to serve a mission when the autumn and winter of life is upon us?\nWe are prisoners of love. Come, my beloved brethren. Let our generation do something great and noble, come join our ranks. Let us march by the thousands out into the vineyards to nurture, teach and bless the tender branches. Let us protect and bless the fruit of the harvest. Let us gather the sheaves into the garners, away from the storm, safe from the whirlwind, a holy place where the storm cannot penetrate.\nA good man said: \u201cI believe the test of a great man is humility. I do not mean by humility the doubt in one\u2019s own personal power; but really, truly great men have the curious feeling that greatness is not in them but through them and they see the divine in every other human soul and are endlessly, foolishly, incredibly merciful.\u201d\nThat sounds like our generation. Who knows but what God will grant for us and ours what we do for others? Come, lift your banner high and march with us into the mission field in the spirit of love and caring.\nPonder and pray together. Begin to prepare. Our generation can do something great for those who follow. Have we been \u201csteeled\u201d for the very purpose about which I have been speaking? Let the ranks of missionaries swell with couples from every broad reach of this earth that the fruit will remain, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nVaughn J. Featherstone\nA Prisoner of Love\n1992\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Our son-in-law told his daughter, three-year-old Eliza, that for family home evening they were going to have a lesson on a very special subject. She got a big smile on her face and attempted to guess the surprise. \u201cIt must be about me,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I am very special!\u201d Eliza remembers and knows who she is\u2014a very special child of God. She has learned this from her mother, who from Eliza\u2019s earliest infancy has sung our opening hymn, \u201cI Am a Child of God\u201d (Hymns, no. 301), as a nightly lullaby.\nAll over the world and in almost every language, young women ages 12 to 18 declare the same thing: \u201cWe are daughters of our Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we love Him\u201d (\u201cYoung Women Theme,\u201d Young Women Personal Progress [booklet, 2001], 5). Yet as they grow up, they often grow away from the confident knowledge of three-year-old Eliza that they are very special. Youth often experience an identity crisis, wondering who they really are. The teenage years are also a time of what I describe as \u201cidentity theft,\u201d meaning that worldly ideas, philosophies, and deceits confuse us, buffet us, and seek to rob us of the knowledge of our true identity.\nOne very good young woman said to me, \u201cSometimes I am not sure who I am. I don\u2019t feel Heavenly Father\u2019s love. My life seems hard. Things are not turning out the way I wanted, hoped, and dreamed they would.\u201d What I said to her I now say to young women everywhere: I know unequivocally that you are a daughter of God. He knows you, He loves you, and He has a plan for you. I know this is a message Heavenly Father wants me to share with you.\nLatter-day prophets and apostles testify of our divine natures. The proclamation to the world on the family says, \u201cEach [of us] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny\u201d (Liahona, Oct. 2004, 49; Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). And President Gordon B. Hinckley has also said:\n\u201cYou are second to none. You are daughters of God.\n\u201cThere has come to you as your birthright something beautiful and sacred and divine. Never forget that. Your Eternal Father is the great Master of the universe. He rules over all, but He also will listen to your prayers as His daughter and hear you as you speak with Him. He will answer your prayers. He will not leave you alone\u201d (\u201cStay on the High Road,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, May 2004, 112).\nAs you let the knowledge that you are a daughter of God settle deep into your soul, it will comfort you, strengthen your faith, and influence your conduct. If you let this virtuous truth garnish your thoughts unceasingly, you will have confidence in the presence of God, as our Mutual theme scripture promises (see D&C 121:45).\nHow can each of us know and feel that we are Heavenly Father\u2019s daughters? There is a veil between heaven and earth, \u201ca sleep and a forgetting\u201d (William Wordsworth, \u201cOde: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,\u201d stanza 5, line 58) when we are born. This is necessary for us to \u201cgain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destin[ies] as [heirs to] eternal life\u201d (Liahona, Oct. 2004, 49; Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us remember Him, so He provides for us glimpses into eternity. The Apostle Paul taught that \u201cthe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God\u201d (Romans 8:16). The Spirit gives us glimpses into who we are. Often the Spirit speaks to us when we pray, read the scriptures, ponder upon the Lord\u2019s mercies to us, receive priesthood blessings, serve others, or feel loved and affirmed by others.\nMoses learned who he was through a powerful spiritual experience. He talked with God face-to-face and learned that he was God\u2019s son, with a special mission to perform. After having this experience, Moses was then buffeted by Satan. But because Moses had felt of God\u2019s glory, he recognized that Satan did not have any glory. Because Moses knew that he was God\u2019s son and that God had a mission for him, he had the power and ability to resist Satan, to make righteous judgments, to call upon God for strength, and to continue to have His Spirit to be with him. (See Moses 1.)\nThe same pattern applies to us. As we come to know and feel who we really are, we are enabled to recognize the difference between good and evil and are empowered to resist temptation. One of the ways we can come to understand the divinely appointed mission the Lord has for us is through our patriarchal blessings. These are very specific and individual messages we can each receive by the power of the priesthood.\nAnother way to receive spiritual insights about our own eternal natures is from a parent or a leader who can reassure us because of his or her inspired glimpses into who we really are. The Spirit has whispered very specifically to me on occasion about the true identity of my children. I remember the night before one of our babies was born I had the distinct impression that this baby would be a great friend and helper with each of its siblings. This has proved to be absolutely true. Another time when one of our teenagers was very downcast because of involvement in an automobile accident, I distinctly heard these words in my mind: \u201cI love this child and will guide his life.\u201d And He has. Such glimpses have come again and again to me. When they have needed encouragement, I have been blessed with insights into the great and noble eternal spirits of my children.\nHas your mother or father ever reminded you as you were leaving the house to \u201cremember who you are\u201d? What do they mean by that? \u201cRemember that you are part of this family, with a reputation to uphold.\u201d And, even more importantly, \u201cremember that you are a child of God and must act accordingly.\u201d Missionaries wear a badge as a constant reminder that they are representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This reminds missionaries to dress modestly and comely, to treat people with politeness, and to strive to have Christ\u2019s image in their countenances. They must do these things because they wear that name tag, an outward sign of their identity. By covenant, we too have all taken upon ourselves Christ\u2019s name. His name should be engraven inwardly upon our hearts. Likewise, we are expected to act as worthy children of Heavenly Father, who, at least figuratively, has sent us to earth with the admonition \u201cRemember who you are!\u201d\nWhen I was called to serve you, the young women of this Church, I knew I had to behave appropriately. One day one of my daughters got a ticket for parking her car on the street with an expired registration sticker. I took matters into my own hands and went marching into the city government building to explain that the registration papers were currently on their way to us through the mail. As I walked resolutely through the door, someone said to me, \u201cI know who you are.\u201d That stopped me and reminded me that I also needed to remember who I am\u2014not just the Young Women general president, but most especially a daughter of God.\nIn relationships we must remember that others are also children of our Heavenly Father. At the first of our marriage, my husband said quite often, \u201cI didn\u2019t marry you for your looks.\u201d Finally I teased him a bit by saying, \u201cThat really doesn\u2019t sound too flattering.\u201d He explained what I really already knew, that this was intended to be the highest compliment he could give me. He said, \u201cI love you for who you are intrinsically and eternally.\u201d The Lord said: \u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; \u2026 for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart\u201d (1 Samuel 16:7). In families, friendships, dating, and marriage, we should value not just beauty and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, but rather character, good values, and each other\u2019s inherited divine natures.\nIn a stake in Chile the young women did this at camp by keeping a book of each other\u2019s virtuous qualities. Each day they got better acquainted and wrote down the intrinsic good they were learning about each person there. At the end of the camp, they shared their thoughts, helping each person to see more of the divinity within herself. Their leader said, \u201cWe were literally basking in this wonderful spirit of kindness and goodwill. I can honestly say that I never heard a word of complaint from the girls! They were flourishing in a sweet spirit of mutual acceptance that is not often present among teenage girls. There was no competition, no contention. Our camp had become a little bit of heaven\u201d (personal correspondence). The girls recognized and reaffirmed the divine natures of each other, and the Spirit filled the camp as these virtuous thoughts were expressed.\nC. S. Lewis wisely said: \u201cIt is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. \u2026 There are no ordinary people. \u2026 Your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses\u201d (\u201cThe Weight of Glory,\u201d in Screwtape Proposes a Toast and Other Pieces [1974], 109\u201310).\nYoung women everywhere who know they and others are daughters of a loving Heavenly Father show their love for Him by living virtuous, service-oriented, exemplary lives. I have been impressed with young women who were dressed modestly in a very hot and humid part of Brazil. They said, \u201cModesty is not about the climate. It\u2019s about the heart.\u201d These young women knew they were daughters of God.\nI have been touched to learn of the goodness of five young LDS students from Idaho who recently drowned in a terrible accident. They were known by their peers and in their communities for living standards of righteousness and being sterling examples of virtue and wholesomeness. These youth knew they were sons and daughters of God.\nI\u2019ve been warmed by the example of another young woman whose parents got divorced. She did not want her younger brother and sisters to feel unloved, so she says prayers with them every night and tells them she loves them. This young woman knows she is a daughter of a Heavenly Father who loves her, and she loves Him by loving her siblings.\nAnd I have been moved to learn about the actions of young women in a poverty-stricken and politically oppressed area of the world. Despite their own hardships, these young women met at camp and planned ways to lift others. They made hygiene kits for women in need. They did additional service in the community, in hospitals, and in homes. We know by their actions that these young women understand their identity as daughters of God. My heart swells with love for these young women and for young women everywhere. I know that you are daughters of God, who loves you.\nIn conclusion let me share an experience that is tender and even sacred to me. When I was first called to serve as Young Women general president, I felt terrified and inadequate. I lay awake for many nights worrying, repenting, and crying. After several nights of this, I had a very moving experience. I started thinking about my young women nieces, then about the young women in my neighborhood and ward, then about the young women I saw regularly at the high school, and then I envisioned young women of the Church throughout the world, over half a million of them. The most wonderfully warm feeling began to envelop me and surge through me. I felt such exquisite love for Latter-day Saint young women everywhere, each one of you, and I knew that what I was feeling was our Heavenly Father\u2019s love for you. It was powerful and all-encompassing. For the first time I felt peace because I knew what Heavenly Father wanted me to do. He wanted me to witness to you of His great love for you. And so I testify to you again that I know beyond doubt that Heavenly Father knows you and loves you. You are His special daughter. He has a plan for you, and He will ever be there to lead you, guide you, and walk beside you (see \u201cI Am a Child of God\u201d). I earnestly pray that you will know this and feel this, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nSusan W. Tanner\nDaughters of Heavenly Father\n2007\nGeneral Young Women Meeting\n"}, {"text": "How blessed we are by the beautiful music of the Tabernacle Choir.\nMy dear brothers and sisters and friends, I rejoice to stand with you today, to have the great privilege of calling myself a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to be counted as one among you.\nI recall my initial reaction when I received this sacred call from the Lord to serve as the newest member of the First Presidency of this Church\u2014I felt joyfully overwhelmed. Since then I have learned new dimensions of the words humility, gratitude, and faith.\nI can assure you that no one was more surprised by my call than my children and grandchildren.\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we do not seek, nor do we decline, callings that come from God through inspired priesthood channels. I pray that God will grant me strength and an understanding heart to magnify this sacred calling according to His will and purpose.\nWe all miss President Gordon B. Hinckley. His impact on this great work will continue to bless us.\nI feel so privileged to work closely with President Monson. I have known him for many years. He is a man of amazing gifts and talents. He is the prophet of God. His faith and loving heart extend to every nation, tongue, and people.\nI am grateful to serve with President Eyring, whom I love and respect as a great leader and teacher in the kingdom of God.\nWhen the Quorum of the Twelve met in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple to sustain President Monson as the 16th President of the Church, I marveled at the extraordinary abilities, wisdom, and spirituality of those who surrounded me. It made me recognize more clearly my own inadequacies. I love these fine men of great faith. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise my hand to sustain and pledge my support to them. I do love and sustain Elder Christofferson, the newest member of the Twelve.\nWhen the Lord called Frederick G. Williams to be a counselor to the Prophet Joseph Smith, He commanded him to \u201cbe faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d1 I believe this counsel applies to all who accept callings to serve in the kingdom of God\u2014and certainly to me in this season of my life.\nA Prophet of God and Our President\nI would like to say a few words about President Thomas S. Monson. Some years ago, President Monson came to a regional conference in Hamburg, Germany, and it was my honor to accompany him. President Monson has a remarkable memory, and we talked about many of the Saints in Germany\u2014I was amazed that he remembered so many so well.\nPresident Monson asked about Brother Michael Panitsch, a former stake president and then a patriarch, who had been one of the stalwart pioneers of the Church in Germany. I told him that Brother Panitsch was seriously ill, that he was bedridden and unable to attend our meetings.\nPresident Monson asked if we could pay him a visit.\nI knew that shortly before his trip to Hamburg, President Monson had undergone foot surgery and that he could not walk without pain. I explained that Brother Panitsch lived on the fifth floor of a building with no elevators. We would have to climb the stairs to see him.\nBut President Monson insisted. And so we went.\nI remember how difficult it was for President Monson to climb those stairs. He could take only a few at a time before needing to stop and rest. He never uttered a word of complaint, and he would not turn back. Because the building had high ceilings, the stairs seemed to go on forever, but President Monson cheerfully persevered until we arrived at the apartment of Brother Panitsch on the fifth floor.\nOnce there, we had a wonderful visit. President Monson thanked him for his life of dedicated service and cheered him with a smile. Before we left, he gave him a wonderful priesthood blessing.\nNo one but Brother Panitsch, the immediate family, and myself ever saw that act of courage and compassion.\nPresident Monson could have chosen to rest between our long and frequent meetings. He could have asked to see some of the beautiful sights of Hamburg. I have often thought of how remarkable it was that of all the sights in that city, the one he wanted to see more than any other was a feeble and ailing member of the Church who had faithfully and humbly served the Lord.\nPresident Monson came to Hamburg to teach and bless the people of a country, and that is what he did. But at the same time, he focused on the one, name by name. His vision is so broad and far-reaching to grasp the complexities of a worldwide Church, yet he is also so compassionate to focus on the one.\nWhen the Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus, who had been his friend and teacher, he offered this simple description: \u201c[He] went about doing good.\u201d2\nI feel the same can be said of the man we sustain today as the prophet of God.\nThe Faith of Our Fathers\nI marvel at the different backgrounds of members of the Church. You come from all walks of life\u2014all cultures, languages, political circumstances, and religious traditions.\nThis multiplicity of life experiences has caused me to reflect on the message of one of our hymns, \u201cFaith of Our Fathers.\u201d In the refrain, these words are repeated: \u201cFaith of our fathers, holy faith, we will be true to thee till death!\u201d3\nThe faith of our fathers\u2014I love that phrase.\nFor many members of the Church, these words bring to mind valiant pioneers who abandoned the comfort of their homes and traveled by wagon and on foot until they reached the valley of the Great Salt Lake. I love and honor the faith and courage of those early pioneers of the Church. My own ancestors were living an ocean away at the time. None were among those who lived in Nauvoo or Winter Quarters, and none made the journey across the plains. But as a member of the Church, I claim with gratitude and pride this pioneer legacy as my own.\nWith the same joy, I claim the legacies of today\u2019s modern-day Church pioneers who live in every nation and whose own stories of perseverance, faith, and sacrifice add glorious new verses to the great chorus of the latter-day anthem of the kingdom of God.\nWhen my own family contemplates the phrase \u201cfaith of our fathers,\u201d often it is the Lutheran faith that comes to mind. For generations our ancestors belonged to that denomination. In fact, my son recently discovered that one of our family lines connects back to Martin Luther himself.\nWe honor and respect sincere souls from all religions, no matter where or when they lived, who have loved God, even without having the fulness of the gospel. We lift our voices in gratitude for their selflessness and courage. We embrace them as brothers and sisters, children of our Heavenly Father.\nWe believe that it is a fundamental human right to worship \u201cAlmighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.\u201d4\nThere Are Many Faiths and Traditions of Our Fathers\nAs the restored Church of Jesus Christ blossoms throughout the globe\u2014now with more than 13 million members\u2014\u201cthe faith of our fathers\u201d has an expanded meaning. For some, it could refer to their family\u2019s heritage in one of the hundreds of Christian faiths; for others, it could refer to Middle-Eastern, Asian, or African faiths and traditions.\nI have spent most of my life in areas of the world where members of our Church are a small minority. During that time I have learned that often when people learn of the restored gospel, they are impressed by it\u2014many even want to join the Church. But they are reluctant to disappoint their ancestors; they feel they should be true to the faith of their fathers.\nI remember when I was a young man, one Sunday I noticed a new family in our meetinghouse\u2014a young mother with two daughters. It wasn\u2019t long before the three were baptized and became members of the Church.\nI know the story of their conversion intimately because the oldest daughter\u2019s name was Harriet, and later she would become my wife.\nHarriet\u2019s mother, Carmen, had recently lost her husband, and during a period of introspection, she became interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After studying the doctrines, Carmen and her daughters knew the Church was true and made plans for baptism.\nWhen Carmen told her mother about this decision, however, her mother was devastated. \u201cHow can you be so unfaithful to the faith of your fathers?\u201d she asked.\nCarmen\u2019s mother was not the only one who objected. Carmen\u2019s strong-willed sister, Lisa, was every bit as troubled by the news. Perhaps troubled is too soft a word. She was very angry.\nLisa said that she would find those young missionaries and tell them just how wrong they were. She marched to the chapel and found the missionaries, and, you guessed it, Lisa was baptized too.\nMany years later, Carmen\u2019s mother also received a testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored to the earth. One day she said to her daughters and grandchildren, \u201cI want to be in the same heaven as you.\u201d While in her mid-70s, she too entered the waters of baptism and became a member of the Church.\nThe Faith of Our Father\nWhat, then, is the faith of our fathers? Is it the religion of our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents?\nBut what of the faith of the ancient ones before them? What of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Are they not our fathers? Are we not of the house of Israel? What of Noah and Enoch and our first parents, Adam and Eve?\nWhat of the Savior and those disciples who followed Him?\nThe faith of our Father in Heaven has been consistent since the beginning of time, even from before the foundation of this world. John the Revelator described a great war in heaven.5 The issue was moral agency, as it is today. All who have ever lived on this earth were among those who fought against Satan and stood with the Son and the Father. Therefore, do we not owe our allegiance to God, our Heavenly Father?\nAs members of the Church of Jesus Christ, \u201cwe believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\u201d6 And \u201cwe believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\u201d7 We believe in the great plan of happiness, the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, whereby God\u2019s children may experience mortality and return to the presence of the Father\u2014a merciful plan established from before the foundation of this earth.\nThis is the plan and the faith of our Father!\nI testify that the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the faith of our Heavenly Father. It is His truth, revealed to His servants the prophets from the days of Father Adam until our own time. The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith to restore the faith of our Father on this earth, never to be taken away again. God desires that all of His children receive it, irrespective of their background, culture, or tradition. True religion should not originate from what pleases men or the traditions of ancestors, but rather from what pleases God, our Eternal Father.\nContinuing revelation is a fundamental feature of this faith. Joseph Smith\u2019s first prayer is a powerful testimony of this. Revelation is a constant compass that keeps us always true to the will and the faith of our Heavenly Father.\nOur Heavenly Father loves His children. He hears the prayers of the humble and sincere of every nation, tongue, and people. He grants light to those who seek and honor Him and are willing to obey His commandments. We joyously proclaim that the faith of our Father is on the earth today.\nWe invite everyone on this beautiful planet to taste of His doctrine and see if it is not sweet and good and precious. We ask those of sincere heart to learn of this doctrine and ask their Father in Heaven if it is not true. And by doing so, all can discover, embrace, and walk in the true faith of their Father, which faith will make them whole.8\nThat is our message to the world.\nI bear solemn witness of the reality of God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; the Holy Ghost; and living prophets who hold the keys, which have come in unbroken succession from Joseph Smith to Thomas S. Monson today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf\nFaith of Our Father\n2008\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I am a convert to the Church. I am so grateful that God answered my prayer and gave me a knowledge and a strong testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\nBefore I made the decision to be baptized in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I studied extracts from the history of Joseph Smith. I prayed after carefully reading each paragraph. If you would like to do this yourself, it may take you 14 hours.\nAfter I read, pondered, and prayed, the Lord gave me the assurance that Joseph Smith was His prophet. I testify to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet, and because I have received this answer from the Lord, I know that all of his successors are prophets too. What a great blessing it is to have prophets in our day!\nWhy is it important to have living prophets to guide the true Church of Jesus Christ and its members?\nIn the Guide to the Scriptures, we find the definition of the word prophet: \u201cA person who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God\u201d (\u201cProphet,\u201d scriptures.lds.org; see also Bible Dictionary, \u201cProphet\u201d).\nIt is a great blessing to receive the word, commandments, and guidance of the Lord in these difficult days of the earth. The prophet can be inspired to see the future in benefit of mankind.\nWe are told that \u201csurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets\u201d (Amos 3:7). We learn from this scripture that the Lord will reveal to His prophets absolutely anything that He feels is necessary to communicate to us. He will reveal His will to us, and He will instruct us through His prophets.\nThe Lord promised us that if we believe in the holy prophets, we should have eternal life (see D&C 20:26). In the sixth article of faith, we declare that we believe in prophets. To believe means to have faith and confidence in them and to follow and do what the prophets ask us to do.\nIn 1980, when President Ezra Taft Benson was serving as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he gave a powerful message about obedience to the prophets at a BYU devotional in the Marriott Center. His great talk, titled \u201cFourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet,\u201d touched my heart. It made me feel good that I had made the decision to follow the prophets for the rest of my life when I accepted baptism in the Lord\u2019s true Church.\nI would like to share with you some of the principles that President Benson taught:\n\u201cFirst: The prophet is the only man who speaks for the Lord in everything\u201d (1980 Devotional Speeches of the Year [1981], 26).\nIn our day the prophet of God has told us to keep the commandments, to love our fellowman, to serve, to take care of the rising generation, to rescue the inactive or less active\u2014to do many things that we call prophetic priorities. We need to understand that these priorities are God\u2019s priorities and the prophet is His voice in communicating them to all of the Church and the world.\nWe are counseled to \u201cgive heed unto all his words and commandments\u201d (D&C 21:4). We also learn:\n\u201cFor his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.\n\u201cFor by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name\u2019s glory\u201d (D&C 21:5\u20136).\nSecond fundamental: \u201cThe living prophet is more vital to us than the standard works\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 26).\nThe living prophet is receiving specific revelations for us. I can remember many times when I have been present to hear one of the servants of the Lord speak about a specific thing for a city or country. I remember at least three of the living prophets, seers, and revelators who have spoken about my country, Brazil. One of these servants said that Brazil would become a great economy in the world and be free of inflation. At the time, we had two-digit inflation every month. It was difficult for many people to believe what the prophet said, but I believed. Brazil has had about 5 percent inflation each year for many consecutive years now. Brazil has become eighth in the world economy, and the country is doing great!\nThird fundamental: \u201cThe living prophet is more important to us than a dead prophet\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 27).\nWe learn a great lesson about this from the scriptures. In the times of Noah it was easier for the people to believe in the dead prophets, but it was difficult for them to believe in Noah. We know that because of their incredulity they did not survive the Flood (see Genesis 6\u20137).\nFourth fundamental: \u201cThe prophet will never lead the Church astray\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 27).\nAgain we learn from the living prophets. President Wilford Woodruff said: \u201cThe Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty\u201d (Official Declaration 1).\nFifth fundamental: \u201cThe prophet is not required to have any particular earthly training or credentials to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 27).\nThe Lord called a young man, Joseph Smith, to restore His Church. Do you think that the young Joseph Smith was a doctor in theology or science? We know that he was a humble and not academically educated young man. But he was chosen by the Lord, and he received from the Lord all that was necessary to honor and magnify the calling of a prophet of the Restoration.\nPresident Benson continued:\n\u201cSixth: The prophet does not have to say \u2018Thus saith the Lord\u2019 to give us scripture. \u2026\n\u201cSeventh: The prophet tells us what we need to know, not always what we want to know\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 27, 28).\nAnd then President Benson quoted from 1 Nephi 16:1, 3:\n\u201cAnd now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear. \u2026\n\u201cAnd now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.\u201d\nEighth fundamental: \u201cThe prophet is not limited by men\u2019s reasoning. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 Does it seem reasonable to cure leprosy by telling a man to wash seven times in a particular river? Yet this is precisely what the prophet Elisha told a leper to do, and he was healed. (See 2 Kings 5.)\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 28).\nAnd President Benson continued giving other principles about obedience to the prophet. I will read the last six and invite you in your next family home evening to find these principles in the words and teachings of our living prophets, seers, and revelators during this general conference.\n\u201cNinth: The prophet can receive revelation on any matter\u2014temporal or spiritual. \u2026\n\u201cTenth: The prophet may be involved in civic matters. \u2026\n\u201cEleventh: The two groups who have the greatest difficulty in following the prophet are the proud who are learned and the proud who are rich. \u2026\n\u201cTwelfth: The prophet will not necessarily be popular with the world or the worldly. \u2026\n\u201cThirteenth: The prophet and his counselors make up the First Presidency\u2014the highest quorum in the Church. \u2026\n\u201cFourteenth: The prophet and the presidency\u2014the living prophet and the first presidency\u2014follow them and be blessed; reject them and suffer\u201d (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 29).\nWe are privileged to have the words of our living prophets, seers, and revelators during this wonderful general conference. They will speak the will of the Lord for us, His people. They will transmit the word of God and His counsel to us. Pay attention and follow their instruction and suggestions, and I testify to you that your life will be completely blessed.\nJesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet of God, and the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nClaudio R. M. Costa\nObedience to the Prophets\n2010\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brothers and sisters, today I would like to speak to the young people of the Church, including our wonderful missionaries. Of course, brothers and sisters who are young at heart are warmly invited to listen.\nLast August\u00a021, President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson dedicated the beautiful Sapporo Temple\u2014the third temple in Japan. The Sapporo Temple is built in northern Japan in a place called Hokkaido. Like Utah, Hokkaido was settled by industrious, hardworking pioneers.\nIn 1876, a renowned educator named Dr. William Clark1 was invited to come to Hokkaido to teach. He lived in Japan for just eight months, but his Christian spirit left a lasting impression on his young non-Christian students. Before leaving, he gave his students a parting message that has become immortalized in this bronze statue.2 He said, \u201cBoys, be ambitious!\u201d\u2014\u201cBe ambitious for Christ.\u201d3 His injunction to \u201cbe ambitious for Christ\u201d can help direct daily decisions for today\u2019s Latter-day Saints.\nWhat does it mean to \u201cbe ambitious for Christ\u201d? Being ambitious for Christ means being motivated, focused, and dedicated to His work. Being ambitious for Christ will seldom mean that we are singled out for public honor. Being ambitious for Christ means that we serve faithfully and diligently in our wards and branches without complaint and with joyful hearts.\nOur missionaries serving throughout the world are beautiful examples of those who are truly ambitious for Christ. A few years ago, Sister Yamashita and I served in the Japan Nagoya Mission. Our missionaries were so ambitious for Christ. One of those missionaries was a young man named Elder Cowan.\nElder Cowan did not have a right leg because of a bicycle accident as a youth. A few weeks after he entered the mission, I received a phone call from his companion. Elder Cowan\u2019s prosthetic leg had broken while he was riding his bike. We took him to a good repair facility, and there in a private room, I saw his leg for the first time. I realized how much pain he had been suffering. His prosthetic leg was repaired, and he returned to his area.\nHowever, as the weeks went by, the prosthesis continued to break again and again. The area medical adviser recommended that Elder Cowan return home for a possible mission reassignment. I resisted this advice because Elder Cowan was a great missionary and he had a strong desire to remain in Japan. Gradually, though, Elder Cowan began to approach his physical limit. In spite of this, he did not murmur or complain.\nAgain, I was advised that Elder Cowan be allowed to serve in a place that did not require him to ride a bike. I pondered this situation. I thought about Elder Cowan and his future, and I prayed about the matter. I felt impressed that, yes, Elder Cowan should return home and await reassignment. I phoned him and expressed my love and concern and told him of my decision. He did not say anything in reply. I could only hear him weeping on the other end of the phone. I said, \u201cElder Cowan, you don\u2019t have to answer me right now. I will call you tomorrow. Please consider my recommendation with sincere prayer.\u201d\nWhen I called him the next morning, he humbly said he would follow my counsel.\nDuring my final interview with him, I asked him this question: \u201cElder Cowan, did you request on your missionary application to be sent to a mission where you would not have to ride a bike?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYes, President, I did.\u201d\nI responded, \u201cElder Cowan, you were called to the Japan Nagoya Mission, where you would have to ride a bike. Did you tell this to your stake president?\u201d\nI was surprised by his answer. He said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I determined that if that is where the Lord called me, I would go to the gym and train my body to be able to ride a bike.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of our interview, he asked me this question with tears in his eyes: \u201cPresident Yamashita, why did I come to Japan? Why am I here?\u201d\nI answered him without hesitation: \u201cElder Cowan, I know one reason you came here. You came here for my benefit. I have come to understand what a great young man I have been serving with. I am blessed to know you.\u201d\nI am happy to report that Elder Cowan returned to his loving home and was reassigned to serve in a mission where he could use a car for his travel. I am proud not only of Elder Cowan but also of all the missionaries throughout the world who serve willingly without murmuring or complaining. Thank you, elders and sisters, for your faith, your focus, and your strong ambition for Christ.\nThe Book of Mormon contains many accounts of those who were ambitious for Christ. Alma the Younger, as a young man, persecuted the Church and its members. He later went through a dramatic change of heart and served as a powerful missionary. He sought the Lord\u2019s direction, and he blessed his companions as he served with them. The Lord strengthened him, and he overcame the trials he faced.\nThis Alma gave his son Helaman the following counsel:\n\u201cWhosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0Keep the commandments of God.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cCounsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good.\u201d4\nOur second son lived much of his youth apart from the Church. When he turned 20, he had an experience that made him want to change his life. With love, prayers, and help from his family and members of the Church, and ultimately through the compassion and grace of the Lord, he returned to the Church.\nHe was later called to serve in the Washington Seattle Mission. He initially suffered great discouragement. Every night for the first three months, he would go into the bathroom and cry. Like Elder Cowan, he sought to understand \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d\nAfter he served for a year, we received an email that was an answer to our prayers. He wrote: \u201cRight now I can really feel the love of God and of Jesus. I will work hard to become like the prophets of old. Though I am also experiencing a lot of difficulties, I am truly happy. Serving Jesus really is the best thing ever. There is nothing as wonderful as this. I am so happy.\u201d\nHe felt as Alma did: \u201cAnd oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!\u201d5\nIn our lives we experience trials, but if we are ambitious for Christ, we can focus on Him and feel joy even in the midst of them. Our Redeemer is the ultimate example. He understood His holy mission and was obedient to the will of God the Father. What a choice blessing it is to bring His wonderful example to our remembrance each week as we partake of the sacrament.\nMy dear brothers and sisters, we are ambitious for Christ when we serve faithfully, accept humbly, endure nobly, pray fervently, and partake worthily.\nMay we be ambitious for Christ as we accept our difficulties and trials with patience and faith and find joy in our covenant path.\nI testify that the Lord knows you. He knows your struggles and concerns. He knows of your desires to serve Him with devotion and, yes, even ambition. May He guide and bless you as you do so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita\nBe Ambitious for Christ\n2016\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "The rolling forth of the Lord\u2019s plan of salvation during this dispensation of the fulness of times is almost beyond comprehension.1 This is exemplified by President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\u2019s announcement of 4\u00a0new temples in this conference session. When President Monson was called as an Apostle in 1963, there were 12 operating temples in the world.2 With the dedication of the Provo City Center Temple, there are now 150, and there will be 177\u00a0when all announced temples are dedicated. This is cause for us to humbly rejoice.\nOne hundred eighty years ago, on this very day, April\u00a03, 1836, a magnificent vision was opened to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. This occurred just one week after the dedication of that temple. In this vision they saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit in the temple. Among other things, the Savior declared:\n\u201cLet the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name.\n\u201cFor behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house.\u201d3\nOn that sacred occasion, ancient prophets appeared, including Elijah, who bestowed the keys essential for temple ordinances.\nWe have some sense of the rejoicing that is going on in Quito, Ecuador;\u00a0Harare, Zimbabwe; Bel\u00e9m, Brazil; and Lima, Peru, both with members and missionaries, based on what happened in Bangkok, Thailand, a year ago when that temple was announced. Sister Shelly Senior, wife of the then-president of the Thailand Bangkok Mission, David Senior, emailed family and friends to say that after she and her husband had listened to President Monson announce that temple, there had been \u201c12 sleepless hours and lots of tears of happiness.\u201d They called their mission assistants at 11:30 p.m. and informed them. The assistants called all the missionaries. The report came back that the \u201cwhole mission was awake in the middle of the night jumping on their beds.\u201d Sister Senior humorously admonished family and friends, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell the Missionary Department!\u201d4\nThe deep spiritual response of the members in Thailand was equally strong. I am confident there have been spiritual preparations in hearts and homes and manifestations from heaven preparing the Saints where these newly announced temples will be located.\nSister Senior, in Thailand, had some special hand mirrors made for her personal teaching, especially with sisters. There was a temple etched in the mirror with the wording, \u201cSee Yourself in the Temple.\u201d As people gazed into the mirror, they saw themselves in the temple. The Seniors taught the investigators and members to picture themselves in the temple and make the necessary lifestyle changes and spiritual preparations to meet this goal.\nMy challenge this morning is for each of us, wherever we live, to see ourselves in the temple. President Monson has stated: \u201cUntil you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there, you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer. The all-important and crowning blessings of membership in the Church are those blessings which we receive in the temples of God.\u201d5\nDespite the lack of righteousness in the world today, we live in a sacred, holy time. Prophets, with loving and longing hearts, have described our day for centuries.6\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith, citing both Obadiah7 in the Old Testament and 1 Peter8 in the New Testament, acknowledged the great purpose of God in providing baptism for the dead and allowing us to be saviors on Mount Zion.9\nThe Lord has prospered our people and provided the resources and prophetic guidance so we can be valiant in attending to our temple responsibilities for both the living and the dead.\nBecause of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we understand the purpose of life, the Father\u2019s plan of salvation for His children, the Savior\u2019s redemptive sacrifice, and the central role of families in the organization of heaven.10\nThe combination of increased numbers of temples and advanced technology to fulfill our sacred family history responsibilities for our ancestors makes this the most blessed time in all history. I rejoice in the extraordinary faithfulness of our youth in indexing and finding their ancestors and then doing the baptism and confirmation work in the temple. You are literally among the prophesied saviors on Mount Zion.\nHow Do We Prepare for the Temple?\nWe know that righteousness and sanctification are essential parts of preparing for the temple.\nIn Doctrine and Covenants section 97, it reads, \u201cAnd inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it.\u201d11\nUntil 1891 the President of the Church signed each temple recommend to protect the sanctity of the temple. That responsibility was then delegated to bishops and stake presidents.\nIt is our great desire that members of the Church will live to be worthy of a temple recommend. Please don\u2019t see the temple as some distant and perhaps unachievable goal. Working with their bishop, most members can achieve all righteous requirements in a relatively short period of time if they have a determination to qualify and fully repent of transgressions. This includes being willing to forgive ourselves and not focus on our imperfections or sins as disqualifying us from ever entering a sacred temple.\nThe Savior\u2019s Atonement was accomplished for all of God\u2019s children. His redeeming sacrifice satisfies the demands of justice for all those who truly repent. The scriptures describe this in a most beautiful fashion:\n\u201cThough your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.\u201d12\n\u201cAnd I will remember [them] no more.\u201d13\nWe assure you that living righteous principles will bring you and your family happiness, fulfillment, and peace.14 Members, both adults and youth,15 self-certify their worthiness when they answer the temple recommend questions. The essential requirement is to increase our testimony of God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Restoration of His gospel and to experience the ministering of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Blessings of the Temple Are Numerous\nThe primary blessings of the temple are the ordinances of exaltation. The gospel plan is about exaltation and encompasses making and keeping sacred covenants with God. Except for baptism and confirmation, these ordinances and covenants are performed and received in the temple for the living. For the dead, all the saving ordinances and covenants are received in the temple.\nBrigham Young taught, \u201cThere is not one thing that the Lord could do for the salvation of the human family that he has neglected to do; \u2026 all that can be accomplished for their salvation, independent of them, has been accomplished in and by the Savior.\u201d16\nChurch leaders organize stakes, wards, quorums, Church auxiliaries, missions, and so forth in our chapels and other buildings. The Lord organizes eternal families only in temples.\nIt is clear that those with broken hearts and contrite spirits who have truly repented of their sins are completely acceptable to the Lord in His holy house.17 We know \u201cGod is no respecter of persons.\u201d18 One of the precious things I love about the temple is that among those who attend, there are no distinctions of wealth, rank, or position of any kind. We are all equal before God. Everyone is dressed in white to signify we are a pure and righteous people.19 All sit side by side with a desire in their hearts to be worthy sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father.\nJust think, across the entire world women and men can through \u201csacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples \u2026 return to the presence of God and \u2026 be united eternally.\u201d20 They do this in a beautiful, sacred sealing room available to all temple-worthy members. After they enter into these covenants, they can \u201csee themselves in the temple\u201d mirrors that face each other. \u201cTogether the temple mirrors reflect back and forth images that stretch seemingly into eternity.\u201d21 These reflected images help us contemplate parents, grandparents, and all previous generations. They help us recognize the sacred covenants that connect us to all generations that follow. This is incredibly significant, and it starts when you see yourself in the temple.\nPresident Howard\u00a0W. Hunter counseled us to \u201cconsider the majestic teachings in the great dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, a prayer the Prophet Joseph Smith said was given to him by revelation. It is a prayer that continues to be answered upon us individually, upon us as families, and upon us as a people because of the priesthood power the Lord has given us to use in His holy temples.\u201d22 We would do well to study the 109th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and to follow President Hunter\u2019s admonition \u201cto establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of [our] membership.\u201d23\nThe temple is also a place of refuge, thanksgiving, instruction, and understanding, \u201cthat [we] may be perfected \u2026 in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth.\u201d24 Throughout my life it has been a place of tranquility and peace in a world that is literally in commotion.25 It is wonderful to leave the cares of the world behind in that sacred setting.\nOften in the temple, and as we engage in family history research, we feel promptings and have impressions from the Holy Ghost.26 Occasionally in the temple the veil between us and those on the other side becomes very thin. We get additional assistance in our efforts to be saviors on Mount Zion.\nSeveral years ago in a temple in Central America, the wife of one of our now-emeritus General Authorities assisted a father, a mother, and their children in receiving eternal covenants in the sealing room, where the temple mirrors are located. As they concluded and faced those mirrors, she noticed there was a face in the mirror that was not in the room. She inquired of the mother and learned that a daughter had passed away and accordingly was not physically present. The deceased daughter was then included by proxy in the sacred ordinance.27 Never underestimate the assistance provided in temples from the other side of the veil.\nPlease know how earnestly we desire that everyone make any necessary changes to qualify for the temple. Prayerfully review where you are in your life, seek the guidance of the Spirit, and talk to your bishop about preparing yourself for the temple. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has said, \u201cThere is no more important goal for you to work toward than being worthy to go to the temple.\u201d28\nThe Savior \u201cIs the Chief, Immovable Cornerstone of Our Faith and His Church\u201d\nI was privileged to participate with President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring at the rededication of the Suva Fiji Temple two months ago. It was a special, sacred occasion. President Eyring\u2019s courage and strong spiritual impressions allowed the rededication to proceed in the face of the worst cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. Physical and spiritual protections were provided to youth, missionaries, and members.29 The hand of the Lord was clearly evident. The Suva Fiji Temple rededication was a refuge from the storm. Often as we experience the storms of life, we witness the Lord\u2019s hand in providing eternal protections.\nThe original dedication of the Suva Fiji Temple on June\u00a018, 2000, was also remarkable. As the temple neared completion, members of parliament were taken hostage by a group of rebels. Downtown Suva, Fiji, was looted and burned. The military declared martial law.\nAs the Area President, I went with the four stake presidents in Fiji and met the military leaders at the Queen Elizabeth barracks. After we explained the proposed dedication, they were supportive but concerned about the safety of President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley. They recommended a small dedication with no events outside the temple, like the cornerstone ceremony. They emphasized that anyone outside the temple could be a potential target for violence.\nPresident Hinckley approved one small dedicatory session with just the new temple presidency and a few local leaders; no others were invited because of the danger. However, he emphatically stated, \u201cIf we do dedicate the temple, we will have the cornerstone ceremony because Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone, and this is His Church.\u201d\nWhen we actually went outside for the cornerstone ceremony, there were no nonmembers, children, media, or others present. But a faithful prophet demonstrated his courageous and unwavering commitment to the Savior.\nLater President Hinckley, speaking of the Savior, said: \u201cThere is none to equal Him. There never has been. There never will be. Thanks be to God for the gift of His Beloved Son, who gave His life that we might live and who is the chief, immovable cornerstone of our faith and His Church.\u201d30\nBrothers and sisters, I pray that each of us will honor the Savior and make any necessary changes to see ourselves in His sacred temples. In doing so, we can accomplish His holy purposes and prepare ourselves and our families for all the blessings the Lord and His Church can bestow in this life and eternity. I bear my sure witness that the Savior lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Quentin\u00a0L. Cook\nSee Yourself in the Temple\n2016\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "From where we speak, it is a beautiful April Sabbath morning. The tulips are well out of the ground and will soon be bursting into flowering beauty. In the winter of our doubt there came the hope of spring. We knew it would come. Such was our faith, based on the experiences of earlier years.\nAnd so it is with matters of the spirit and soul. As each man or woman walks the way of life there come dark seasons of doubt, of discouragement, of disillusionment. In such circumstances, a few see ahead by the light of faith, but many stumble along in the darkness and even become lost.\nMy call to you this morning is a call to faith, that faith which is \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\u201d (Heb. 11:1), as Paul described it.\nIn the process of conversion, the investigator of the Church hears a little. He may read a little. He does not, he cannot, comprehend the wonder of it all. But if he is earnest in his search, if he is willing to get on his knees and pray about it, the Spirit touches his heart, perhaps ever so lightly. It points him in the right direction. He sees a little of what he has never seen before. And with faith, whether it be recognized or not, he takes a few guarded steps. Then another, brighter vista opens before him.\nLong ago I worked for one of our railroads whose tracks threaded the passes through these western mountains. I frequently rode the trains. It was in the days when there were steam locomotives. Those great monsters of the rails were huge and fast and dangerous. I often wondered how the engineer dared the long journey through the night. Then I came to realize that it was not one long journey, but rather a constant continuation of a short journey. The engine had a powerful headlight that made bright the way for a distance of 400 or 500 yards. The engineer saw only that distance, and that was enough, because it was constantly before him all through the night into the dawn of the new day.\nThe Lord has spoken of this process. He said: \u201cThat which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.\n\u201cThat which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day\u201d (D&C 50:23\u201324).\nAnd so it is with our eternal journey. We take one step at a time. In doing so we reach toward the unknown, but faith lights the way. If we will cultivate that faith, we shall never walk in darkness.\nLet me tell you of a man I know. I will not mention his name lest he feel embarrassed. His wife felt there was something missing in their lives. She spoke with a relative one day who was a member of the Church. The relative suggested that she call the missionaries. She did so. But the husband was rude to them and told them not to come again.\nMonths passed. One day another missionary, finding the record of this visit, decided that he and his companion would try again. He was a tall elder from California who carried a big smile on his face.\nThey knocked on the door; the man answered. Could they come in for a few minutes? they asked. He consented.\nThe missionary said, in effect, \u201cI wonder if you know how to pray.\u201d The man answered that he knew the Lord\u2019s Prayer. The missionary said, \u201cThat is good, but let me tell you how to give a personal prayer.\u201d He went on to explain that we get on our knees in an attitude of humility before the God of heaven. The man did so. The missionary then went on to say, \u201cWe address God as our Father in Heaven. We then thank Him for His blessings, such as our health, our friends, our food. We then ask for His blessings. We express our innermost hopes and desires. We ask Him to bless those in need. We do it all in the name of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, concluding with \u2018amen.\u2019\u201d\nIt was a pleasant experience for the man. He had gleaned a little light and understanding, a touch of faith. He was ready to try another step.\nLine upon line, the missionaries patiently taught him. He responded as his faith grew into a dim light of understanding. Friends from his branch gathered around to reassure him and answer his questions. The men played tennis with him, and he and his family were invited to their homes for dinner.\nHe was baptized, and that was a giant step of faith. The branch president asked him to be a Scoutmaster to four boys. That led to other responsibilities, and the light of faith strengthened in his life with each new opportunity and experience.\nThat has continued. Today he stands as a capable and loved stake president, a leader of great wisdom and understanding, and above all, a man of great faith.\nThe challenge which faces every member of this Church is to take the next step, to accept that responsibility to which he is called, even though he does not feel equal to it, and to do so in faith with the full expectation that the Lord will light the way before him.\nLet me give you a story of a woman in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. She worked while going to school to provide for her family. I use her own words in telling this story. She says:\n\u201cThe university in which I studied had a regulation that prohibited the students that were in debt from taking tests. For this reason, when I received my salary I would first separate the money for tithing and offerings, and the remainder was allotted for the payment of the school and other expenses.\n\u201cI remember a time when I \u2026 faced serious financial difficulties. It was a Thursday when I received my salary. When I figured the monthly budget, I noticed that there wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay [both] my tithing and my university. I would have to choose between them. The bimonthly tests would start the following week, and if I didn\u2019t take them I could lose the school year. I felt great agony. \u2026 My heart ached. I had a painful decision before me, and I didn\u2019t know what to decide. I pondered between the two choices: to pay tithing or to risk the possibility of not obtaining the necessary credits to be approved in school.\n\u201cThis feeling consumed my soul and remained with me up to Saturday. It was then that I remembered that when I was baptized I had agreed to live the law of tithing. I had taken upon myself an obligation, not with the missionaries, but with my Heavenly Father. At that moment, the anguish started to disappear, giving place to a pleasant sensation of tranquility and determination. \u2026\n\u201cThat night when I prayed, I asked the Lord to forgive me for my indecision. On Sunday, before the beginning of sacrament meeting, I contacted the bishop, and with great pleasure I paid my tithing and offerings. That was a special day. I felt happy and peaceful within myself and with Heavenly Father.\n\u201cThe next day I was in my office; I tried to find a way to be able to take the tests that would begin on Wednesday. The more I thought, the further I felt from a solution. At that time I worked in an attorney\u2019s office, and my employer was the most strict and austere person I had ever met.\n\u201cThe working period was ending when my employer approached and gave the last orders of the day. When he had done so, with his briefcase in his hand he bid farewell. \u2026 Suddenly, he halted, and looking at me he asked, \u2018How is your college?\u2019 I was surprised, and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. The only thing I could answer with a trembling voice was, \u2018Everything is all right!\u2019 He looked thoughtfully at me and bid farewell again. \u2026\n\u201cSuddenly the secretary entered the room, saying that I was a very fortunate person! When I asked her why, she simply answered: \u2018The employer has just said that from today on the company is going to pay fully for your college and your books. Before you leave, stop at my desk and inform me of the costs so that tomorrow I can give you the check.\u2019\n\u201cAfter she left, crying and feeling very humble, I knelt exactly where I was and thanked the Lord for His generosity. I \u2026 said to Heavenly Father that He didn\u2019t have to bless me so much. I only needed the cost of one month\u2019s installment, and the tithing I had paid on Sunday was very small compared to the amount I was receiving! During that prayer the words recorded in Malachi came to my mind: \u2018Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\u2019 (Mal. 3:10). Up to that moment I had never felt the magnitude of the promise contained in that scripture and that this commandment was truly a witness of the love that God, our Heavenly Father, gives to His children here on earth.\u201d\nFaith is the very fiber that gives strength to this work. Wherever this Church is established across this broad world, it is evident. It is not limited to one country or one nation or one language or one people. It is found everywhere. We are a people of faith. We walk by faith. We move forward on our eternal journey, one step at a time.\nGreat is the promise of the Lord to the faithful everywhere. He has said:\n\u201cI, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.\n\u201cGreat shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.\n\u201cAnd to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, \u2026\n\u201cYea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, \u2026\n\u201cAnd their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.\n\u201cFor by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will\u2014yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man\u201d (D&C 76:5\u201310).\nHow could anyone ask for more? How glorious is this work in which we are engaged. How wondrous are the ways of the Almighty when we walk in faith before Him.\nThe faith of an investigator is like a piece of green wood, thrown on a blazing fire. Warmed by the flames, it dries and begins to burn. But if it is pulled away, it cannot sustain itself. Its flickering flame dies. But if left with the fire, it gradually begins to burn with brightness. Soon it is part of the flaming fire and will light other, greener wood.\nAnd so goes, my brothers and sisters, this great work of faith, lifting people across this broad earth to increased understanding of the ways of the Lord and greater happiness in following His pattern.\nMay God, our Eternal Father, continue to smile upon this, His Kingdom, and cause it to prosper as we, His children, walk in faith is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon B. Hinckley\nWe Walk by Faith\n2002\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Several months ago my husband performed the baptism of a dear friend. As I sat in the service, my mind and heart raced over her years of preparation for that single event\u2014the principles carefully taught, constantly observed, and quietly accepted, the acknowledgment of God\u2019s hand in life events, the sweet confirmation of the Spirit as difficult, but right, choices were made. My mind recalled the past and rejoiced in the present, and I couldn\u2019t help but anticipate the future. I hoped with all my heart that this good woman would remain actively connected to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the rest of her life\u2014that she would continue to learn and live the gospel and experience the fulness of its blessings.\nThis morning, as I remember those hopes, I think about the 375,4691 others who were baptized last year. And then I think of the rest of us, the roughly nine million who have stepped into the waters of baptism sometime in the past. Though our stories are individual, each of us came to that ordinance having been taught the true doctrines of the kingdom, having felt the Spirit, having understood how the doctrines fit into the context of our lives, and having demonstrated a willingness to try always to live those truths.\nIt seems too hard to think about the possibility, even the probability, that not all of us will continue to \u201ccling to the Church and live its principles.\u201d2 Many of us will leave and never return to this happy fellowship. Some of us will leave for a time and find our way back with a heightened sense of gratitude for participation in the kingdom of God on earth. The reality of life is that each of us is daily at risk for drifting or even marching into inactivity.\nThere are so many things in place to help us remain active. This morning I would like to talk about just one of them. I would like to suggest that the ordinary Church classroom is a powerful setting for steady and continued growth in the gospel.\nSunday School, priesthood, Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, seminary, and institute classes may be held in dedicated buildings, under a tree, or in a home. But each class is part of a plan for lifelong gospel learning. We can have great expectations for the power of those learning hours! Church classes provide a place where we can repeatedly experience the very things that brought us into the waters of baptism, where we learn doctrine and receive the ratifying witness of its truth, where we come to understand how doctrine is applied in the reality of our daily lives and accept the challenge to change our behavior accordingly.\nThe fundamental curriculum for all classes in the Church is the scriptures3\u2014they contain the unchanging doctrines of the kingdom of God. These truths are what brought us into the Church. If we fail to continue learning them, we may not stay. \u201cYou shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom \u2026 that ye may be prepared in all things.\u201d4\nElder Boyd K. Packer said, \u201cTrue doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.\u201d5 How do we know which doctrine to teach each week? It is stated in the lesson objective. But how do we come to understand the doctrine in a way that it will change our attitudes and behavior?\nIn order to really understand, we have to see the way doctrine is applied. In the lesson manuals, the suggested stories, examples, activities, and games are intended to help the learners understand doctrine in real-life settings.\nBecause the daily life of people varies so much in the 160 different countries where we have organized classes, the stories and examples in the manuals may sometimes confuse the learners. Teachers can prayerfully make adaptations, always taking care that the learning activities chosen truly reflect the doctrine.\nA teacher\u2019s goal is greater than just delivering a lecture about truth. It is to invite the Spirit and use techniques which will enhance the possibility that the learner will discover the truth for herself and then be motivated to apply it. Although some seem to be born teachers, teaching skills can successfully be learned. Where can you go as a teacher to enhance your skills? Could you watch and learn from others? Perhaps approach an admired teacher, asking him to observe and offer suggestions? What about your Primary presidency, if you are a Primary teacher, or your Sunday School presidency, if you teach Sunday School? Asking your ward teacher development coordinator for regular and specific help would put you in touch with a multitude of resources.6 We don\u2019t have to struggle alone in this Church. There is help everywhere. We can prayerfully and courageously seek to learn and practice new techniques.\nI had a conversation once with a young man I cannot forget. His story of activity, complete inactivity, and a return to activity included the description of two classrooms. He said: \u201cWhen I was about 15, I started to have a lot of questions about the Church. I thought maybe there would be a chance to talk about my questions at church, but it didn\u2019t happen. In priesthood it seemed like most of the time everybody talked about the game the night before. Sunday School was about the same\u2014maybe a little lesson thrown in during the last five minutes where the teacher asked questions, and it was kind of \u2018guess-the-right-answer-from-the-manual-time.\u2019\u201d\nWell, other things happened\u2014late Saturday nights, a switch to an earlier meeting schedule\u2014and soon the young man\u2019s attendance dropped to nothing. Several years passed by until he found himself in church again. This time his face lit up as he described his Sunday School class:\n\u201cThe teacher was this unimpressive-looking guy, but he was so excited about what he was teaching. He didn\u2019t waste a minute. He asked important questions. Everyone had their scriptures. They looked up verses. Shared ideas. They listened to each other. They talked about problems at school and how they fit in with the lesson. You could tell that the people in the class were all different, but they had one amazing thing in common\u2014they were all interested in learning the gospel. After five minutes, I knew that this was a good place for me.\u201d\nWhat a difference in those experiences! Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of classrooms every Sunday, each with a teacher who understands that \u201cthe learning has to be done by the pupil. Therefore it is the pupil who has to be put into action. When a teacher takes the spotlight, becomes the star of the show, does all the talking, and otherwise takes over all of the activity, it is almost certain that he is interfering with the learning of the class members.\u201d7\nA skilled teacher doesn\u2019t think, \u201cWhat shall I do in class today?\u201d but asks, \u201cWhat will my students do in class today?\u201d; not, \u201cWhat will I teach today?\u201d but rather, \u201cHow will I help my students discover what they need to know?\u201d8 The skilled teacher does not want students who leave the class talking about how magnificent and unusual the teacher is. This teacher wants students who leave talking about how magnificent the gospel is!\nLearning occurs best in an atmosphere of trust and safety. This means that each person\u2019s questions and contributions are respected. When we feel safe and included, we can ask questions that will help us to understand the gospel. We can share insights and faith that might help someone else.9 We can stumble without embarrassment as we try to apply the lessons taught. Conversely, when we feel that we must protect and defend ourselves or seem more righteous than we are, our energy is used counterproductively and our learning and the learning of others is severely limited. Maintaining a climate of trust and safety is a responsibility the teacher and the learners share.\nI have heard Sister Janette Beckham, Young Women general president, talk simply about teaching a class. She says:\n\u201cIt is the teacher\u2019s responsibility to introduce the lesson and help lay the groundwork. The middle part belongs to the students where they participate and work toward understanding and application. Then the teacher must watch the time, because she owns the last few minutes of class. She has a responsibility to clarify and summarize the doctrine taught so that learners will not leave confused about the message. Then she can bear personal testimony of the principle under discussion.\u201d10\nIn conclusion, will you come with me into a classroom of 12- and 13-year-old young women. Listen as you hear the learners discover doctrine. Notice the experience the teacher provides for the learners so that they can connect the doctrine to the reality of their lives. Feel the accompanying witness of the Spirit:\nOur teacher moves her chair closer into the semicircle of five girls. \u201cWe have a guest waiting outside,\u201d she begins. \u201cIt is Sister Jonas. She has agreed to show us her tiny baby and tell us how she feels about being a new mother. As you watch this new little baby, would you also notice his mother, how she treats the baby, what she does, what she says. We\u2019ll talk about her visit after she leaves.\u201d\nSister Jonas comes in, spends seven or eight minutes talking about her baby and answering questions. The girls thank her, and she leaves the classroom.\n\u201cThe baby was darling, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d our teacher responds to the delighted hum of the class. \u201cBut what did you notice about the mother?\u201d\nA minute of silence and then a response: \u201cWell, she was happy.\u201d Another: \u201cShe kind of rocked back and forth the whole time she was holding him.\u201d A few more responses, and then Katie slowly begins, \u201cShe\u2014ummm\u2014she talked really quietly.\u201d\n\u201cCould you say more about that?\u201d the teacher coaxes.\n\u201cWell, her voice reminds me of my mother\u2019s voice when she called from the hospital to tell us we had a new baby sister last year.\u201d\nThe teacher, turning to the other girls: \u201cWhat do you think? Did anyone else notice her voice?\u201d\nThe girls become more thoughtful and begin to reply with words like \u201creverence,\u201d \u201cheaven,\u201d \u201clove.\u201d\nThe teacher: \u201cI think I understand. I believe those words come to our minds because we are recognizing a great gift from our Heavenly Father. He loves us and trusts us so much that He is willing to share His creative powers with us. We feel such gratitude and reverence for this trust. Motherhood is a divine role.\u201d\nAfter this clear statement of doctrine and testimony, our teacher moves on to an activity where the girls identify qualities their own mothers exhibit that show an understanding of the divinity of motherhood. \u201cCould each of you prepare for motherhood right now by practicing one of these very virtues\u2014maybe being more patient, kinder, or more positive this week?\u201d\nEach girl talks about her choice. Our teacher bears personal testimony. The closing prayer is offered.\nA simple class. No sensational stories. No scholarly class members. Just ones who come prepared to participate. No extraordinarily gifted teacher. Just one who prayerfully prepares and uses techniques that allow her to help class members understand and apply true doctrine.\nI telephoned our newly baptized friend last week to ask how things were going for her. Her response was enthusiastic: \u201cMy husband and I have been called to teach the 15- and 16-year-olds, and I\u2019m learning so much!\u201d I felt reassured and excited. What better place than a classroom\u2014for her and for each of us!\nPresident Hinckley encourages us: \u201cWe are all in it together, all of us, and we have a great work to do. Every teacher can be a better teacher than he or she is today.\u201d11 I would add: Every learner can be a better learner than he or she is today. And every classroom can be a better classroom.\nI pray that we will continue to hold on to one another through effective classroom learning. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nVirginia H. Pearce\nThe Ordinary Classroom\u2014a Powerful Place for Steady and Continued Growth\n1996\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "The Savior performed His first recorded miracle at a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee. Mary, His mother, and His disciples were there as well. Mary apparently felt some responsibility for the success of the feast. During the celebration, a problem arose\u2014the wedding hosts ran out of wine. Mary was concerned and went to Jesus. They spoke briefly; then Mary turned to the servants and said:\n\u201cWhatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\n\u201cAnd there were set there six waterpots of stone. \u2026 [These waterpots weren\u2019t used to store drinking water but were used for ceremonial washings under the law of Moses.]\n\u201cJesus saith unto [the servants], Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.\n\u201cAnd he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.\n\u201c[Then] the ruler of the feast \u2026 tasted the water that was made wine\u201d and expressed surprise that the best wine was served so late in the feast.1\nWe usually remember this event because transforming water to wine was a demonstration of the power of God\u2014it was a miracle. That is an important message, but there is another important message in John\u2019s account. Mary was \u201ca precious and chosen vessel,\u201d2 called by God to give birth to, nurture, and raise the very Son of God. She knew more about Him than anyone else on earth. She knew the truth of His miraculous birth. She knew that He was sinless and that He \u201cspake not as other men, neither could he be taught; for he needed not that any man should teach him.\u201d3 Mary knew of His extraordinary capacity to solve problems, including one as personal as providing wine for a wedding feast. She had unshakable confidence in Him and in His divine power. Her simple, straightforward instruction to the servants had no caveats, no qualifications, no limitations: \u201cWhatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\u201d\nMary had been a young woman when the angel Gabriel appeared unto her. At first she had been \u201ctroubled\u201d by being called \u201chighly favoured\u201d and \u201cblessed \u2026 among women \u2026 and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\u201d Gabriel reassured her that she had nothing to fear\u2014the news he brought was good. She would \u201cconceive in [her] womb \u2026 the Son of the Highest\u201d and \u201cbring forth a son \u2026 [who] shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever.\u201d\nMary wondered aloud, \u201cHow shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\u201d\nThe angel explained but only briefly, affirming to her that \u201cwith God nothing [is] impossible.\u201d\nMary humbly responded that she would do what God asked, without demanding to know specifics and undoubtedly in spite of having countless questions about the implications for her life. She committed herself without exactly understanding why He was asking that of her or how things would work out. She accepted God\u2019s word unconditionally and in advance,4 with little knowledge of what lay ahead. With simple trust in God, Mary said, \u201cBehold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.\u201d5\nWhen we decide to do \u201cwhatsoever [God] saith unto\u201d us, we earnestly commit to align our everyday behavior with God\u2019s will. Such simple acts of faith as studying the scriptures daily, fasting regularly, and praying with real intent deepen our well of spiritual capacity to meet the demands of mortality. Over time, simple habits of belief lead to miraculous results. They transform our faith from a seedling into a dynamic power for good in our lives. Then, when challenges come our way, our rootedness in Christ provides steadfastness for our souls. God shores up our weaknesses, increases our joys, and causes \u201call things [to] work together for [our] good.\u201d6\nA few years ago, I spoke with a young bishop who was spending hours each week counseling with members of his ward. He made a striking observation. The problems that members of his ward faced, he said, were those faced by Church members everywhere\u2014issues such as how to establish a happy marriage; struggles with balancing work, family, and Church duties; challenges with the Word of Wisdom, with employment, or with pornography; or trouble gaining peace about a Church policy or historical question they didn\u2019t understand.\nHis counsel to ward members very often included getting back to simple practices of faith, such as studying the Book of Mormon\u2014as we were counseled by President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson to do\u2014paying tithing, and serving in the Church with devotion. Frequently, however, their response to him was one of skepticism: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you, Bishop. We all know those are good things to do. We talk about those things all the time in the Church. But I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re understanding me. What does doing any of those things have to do with the issues I\u2019m facing?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fair question. Over time, that young bishop and I have observed that those who are deliberate about doing the \u201csmall and simple things\u201d7\u2014obeying in seemingly little ways\u2014are blessed with faith and strength that go far beyond the actual acts of obedience themselves and, in fact, may seem totally unrelated to them. It may seem hard to draw a connection between the basic daily acts of obedience and solutions to the big, complicated problems we face. But they are related. In my experience, getting the little daily habits of faith right is the single best way to fortify ourselves against the troubles of life, whatever they may be. Small acts of faith, even when they seem insignificant or entirely disconnected from the specific problems that vex us, bless us in all we do.\nConsider Naaman, a \u201ccaptain of the host of \u2026 Syria, \u2026 a mighty man in valour,\u201d and a leper. A servant girl told of a prophet in Israel who could heal Naaman, and so he traveled with an escort of servants, soldiers, and gifts to Israel, eventually arriving at Elisha\u2019s house. Elisha\u2019s servant, not Elisha himself, informed Naaman that the Lord\u2019s command was to \u201cgo and wash in [the river] Jordan seven times.\u201d A simple thing. Perhaps this simple prescription struck the mighty warrior as so illogical, simplistic, or beneath his dignity that he found the mere suggestion offensive. At the very least, Elisha\u2019s instruction didn\u2019t make sense to Naaman, \u201cso he turned and went away in a rage.\u201d\nBut Naaman\u2019s servants gently approached him and observed that he would have done \u201csome great thing\u201d if Elisha had asked it of him. They noted that since he was asked to do only a small task, shouldn\u2019t he do it, even if he didn\u2019t understand why? Naaman reconsidered his reaction and perhaps skeptically, but obediently, \u201cwent \u2026 down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan\u201d and was miraculously healed.8\nSome rewards of obedience do come quickly; others come only after we are tested. In the Pearl of Great Price, we read about Adam\u2019s tireless diligence in keeping the commandment to offer sacrifices. When the angel asked Adam why he was offering sacrifices, he answered, \u201cI know not, save the Lord commanded me.\u201d The angel explained that his sacrifices were \u201ca similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father.\u201d But that explanation came only after Adam had demonstrated his commitment to obeying the Lord for \u201cmany days\u201d without knowing why he was supposed to offer those sacrifices.9\nGod will always bless us for our steadfast obedience to His gospel and loyalty to His Church, but He rarely shows us His timetable for doing so in advance. He doesn\u2019t show us the whole picture from the outset. That is where faith, hope, and trusting in the Lord come in.\nGod asks us to bear with Him\u2014to trust Him and to follow Him. He pleads with us to \u201cdispute not because ye see not.\u201d He cautions us that we shouldn\u2019t expect easy answers or quick fixes from heaven. Things work out when we stand firm during the \u201ctrial of [our] faith,\u201d however hard that test may be to endure or slow the answer may be in coming.10 I am not speaking of \u201cblind obedience\u201d11 but of thoughtful confidence in the perfect love and the perfect timing of the Lord.\nThe trial of our faith will always involve staying true to simple, daily practices of faith. Then, and only then, does He promise that we will receive the divine response for which we long. Only once we have proven our willingness to do what He asks without demanding to know the whens, the whys, and the hows do we \u201creap the rewards of [our] faith, and [our] diligence, and patience, and long-suffering.\u201d12 Real obedience accepts God\u2019s commandments unconditionally and in advance.13\nEvery day, consciously or otherwise, we all choose \u201cwhom [we] will serve.\u201d14 We demonstrate our determination to serve the Lord by faithfully engaging in daily acts of devotion. The Lord promises to direct our paths,15 but for Him to do that, we have to walk, trusting that He knows the way because He is \u201cthe way.\u201d16 We must fill our own waterpots up to the brim. When we trust and follow Him, our lives, like water to wine, are transformed. We become something more and better than we ever otherwise could be. Trust in the Lord, and \u201cwhatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder L.\u00a0Whitney Clayton\nWhatsoever He Saith unto You, Do It\n2017\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "In the depths of his anguish in Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith cried out: \u201cO God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?\u201d1 Many of us, in moments of personal anguish, feel that God is far from us. The pavilion that seems to intercept divine aid does not cover God but occasionally covers us. God is never hidden, yet sometimes we are, covered by a pavilion of motivations that draw us away from God and make Him seem distant and inaccessible. Our own desires, rather than a feeling of \u201cThy will be done,\u201d2 create the feeling of a pavilion blocking God. God is not unable to see us or communicate with us, but we may be unwilling to listen or submit to His will and His time.\nOur feelings of separation from God will diminish as we become more childlike before Him. That is not easy in a world where the opinions of other human beings can have such an effect on our motives. But it will help us recognize this truth: God is close to us and aware of us and never hides from His faithful children.\nMy three-year-old granddaughter illustrated the power of innocence and humility to connect us with God. She went with her family to the open house of the Brigham City Temple in Utah. In one of the rooms of that beautiful building, she looked around and asked, \u201cMommy, where is Jesus?\u201d Her mother explained that she would not see Jesus in the temple, but she would be able to feel His influence in her heart. Eliza carefully considered her mother\u2019s response and then seemed satisfied and said, \u201cOh, Jesus is gone helping someone,\u201d she concluded.\nNo pavilion obscured Eliza\u2019s understanding or obstructed her view of reality. God is close to her, and she feels close to Him. She knew that the temple is the house of the Lord but also understood that the resurrected and glorified Jesus Christ has a body and can only be in one place at a time.3 If He was not at His house, she recognized that He must be in another place. And from what she knows of the Savior, she knew that He would be somewhere doing good for His Father\u2019s children. It was clear that she had hoped to see Jesus, not for a confirming miracle of His existence but simply because she loved Him.\nThe Spirit could reveal to her childlike mind and heart the comfort all of us need and want. Jesus Christ lives, knows us, watches over us, and cares for us. In moments of pain, loneliness, or confusion, we do not need to see Jesus Christ to know that He is aware of our circumstances and that His mission is to bless.\nI know from my own life that Eliza\u2019s experience can be our own long after we leave childhood. In the early years of my career, I worked hard to secure a tenured professorship at Stanford University. I thought I had made a good life for myself and for my family. We lived close to my wife\u2019s parents in very comfortable surroundings. By the world\u2019s standards, I had achieved success. But I was given by the Church the chance to leave California and go to Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho. My lifetime professional objectives might have been a pavilion dividing me from a loving Father who knew better than I did what my future could hold. But I was blessed to know that whatever success I had in my career and family life to that point was a gift from God. And so, like a child, I knelt in prayer to ask what I should do. I was able to hear a quiet voice in my mind that said, \u201cIt\u2019s my school.\u201d There was no pavilion shielding me from God. In faith and humility, I submitted my will to His and felt His care and closeness.\nMy years at Ricks College, during which I tried to seek God\u2019s will and do it, kept the pavilion from covering me or obscuring God\u2019s active role in my life. As I sought to do His work, I felt close to Him and felt assurance that He knew of my affairs and cared deeply for my happiness. But as they had at Stanford, worldly motivations began to present themselves to me. One was an attractive job offer, extended just as I was finishing my fifth year as president of Ricks College. I considered the offer and prayed about it and even discussed it with the First Presidency. They responded with warmth and a little humor but certainly not with any direction. President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball listened to me describe the offer I had received from a large corporation and said: \u201cWell, Hal, that sounds like a wonderful opportunity! And if we ever needed you, we\u2019d know where to find you.\u201d They would have known where to find me, but my desires for professional success might have created a pavilion that would make it hard for me to find God and harder for me to listen to and follow His invitations.\nMy wife, sensing this, had a strong impression that we were not to leave Ricks College. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d But she insisted, wisely, that I must get my own revelation. And so I prayed again. This time I did receive direction, in the form of a voice in my mind that said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you stay at Ricks College a little longer.\u201d My personal ambitions might have clouded my view of reality and made it hard for me to receive revelation.\nThirty days after I was blessed with the inspired decision to turn down the job offer and stay at Ricks College, the Teton Dam burst nearby. God knew that dam would burst and that hundreds of people would need help. He let me seek counsel and gain His permission to stay at Ricks College. He knew all the reasons that my service might still be valuable at the college and in Rexburg. So I was there to ask Heavenly Father frequently in prayer that He would have me do those things that would help the people whose property and lives had been damaged. I spent hours working with other people to clear mud and water from homes. My desire to know and do His will gave me a soul-stretching opportunity.\nThat incident illustrates another way we can create a barrier to knowing God\u2019s will or feeling His love for us: we can\u2019t insist on our timetable when the Lord has His own. I thought I had spent enough time in my service in Rexburg and was in a hurry to move on. Sometimes our insistence on acting according to our own timetable can obscure His will for us.\nIn Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph asked the Lord to punish those who persecuted the members of the Church in Missouri. His prayer was for sure and swift retribution. But the Lord responded that in \u201cnot many years hence,\u201d4 He would deal with those enemies of the Church. In the 24th and 25th verses of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, He says:\n\u201cBehold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;\n\u201cFor there is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall be.\u201d5\nWe remove the pavilion when we feel and pray, \u201cThy will be done\u201d and \u201cin Thine own time.\u201d His time should be soon enough for us since we know that He wants only what is best.\nOne of my daughters-in-law spent many years feeling that God had placed a pavilion over her. She was a young mother of three who longed for more children. After two miscarriages, her prayers of pleading grew anguished. As more barren years passed, she felt tempted to anger. When her youngest went off to school, the emptiness of her house seemed to mock her focus on motherhood\u2014so did the unplanned and even unwanted pregnancies of acquaintances. She felt as committed and consecrated as Mary, who declared, \u201cBehold the handmaid of the Lord.\u201d6 But although she spoke these words in her heart, she could hear nothing in reply.\nHoping to lift her spirits, her husband invited her to join him on a business trip to California. While he attended meetings, she walked along the beautiful, empty beach. Her heart ready to burst, she prayed aloud. For the first time, she asked not for another child but for a divine errand. \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d she cried, \u201cI will give you all of my time; please show me how to fill it.\u201d She expressed her willingness to take her family wherever they might be required to go. That prayer produced an unexpected feeling of peace. It did not satisfy her mind\u2019s craving for certainty, but for the first time in years, it calmed her heart.\nThe prayer removed the pavilion and opened the windows of heaven. Within two weeks she learned that she was expecting a child. The new baby was just one year old when a mission call came to my son and my daughter-in-law. Having promised to go and do anything, anywhere, she put fear aside and took her children overseas. In the mission field she had another child\u2014on a missionary transfer day.\nSubmitting fully to heaven\u2019s will, as this young mother did, is essential to removing the spiritual pavilions we sometimes put over our heads. But it does not guarantee immediate answers to our prayers.\nAbraham\u2019s heart seems to have been right long before Sarah conceived Isaac and before they received their promised land. Heaven had other purposes to fulfill first. Those purposes included not only building Abraham and Sarah\u2019s faith but also teaching them eternal truths that they shared with others on their long, circuitous route to the land prepared for them. The Lord\u2019s delays often seem long; some last a lifetime. But they are always calculated to bless. They need never be times of loneliness or sorrow or impatience.\nAlthough His time is not always our time, we can be sure that the Lord keeps His promises. For any of you who now feel that He is hard to reach, I testify that the day will come that we all will see Him face to face. Just as there is nothing now to obscure His view of us, there will be nothing to obscure our view of Him. We will all stand before Him, in person. Like my granddaughter, we want to see Jesus Christ now, but our certain reunion with Him at the judgment bar will be more pleasing if we first do the things that make Him as familiar to us as we are to Him. As we serve Him, we become like Him, and we feel closer to Him as we approach that day when nothing will hide our view.\nThe movement toward God can be ongoing. \u201cCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,\u201d7 the Savior teaches. And then He tells us how:\n\u201cFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:\n\u201cNaked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\n\u201cThen shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\n\u201cWhen saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?\n\u201cOr when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\n\u201cAnd the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d8\nAs we do what He would have us do for His Father\u2019s children, the Lord considers it kindness to Him, and we will feel closer to Him as we feel His love and His approval. In time we will become like Him and will think of the Judgment Day with happy anticipation.\nThe pavilion that seems to be hiding you from God may be fear of man rather than this desire to serve others. The Savior\u2019s only motivation was to help people. Many of you, as I have, have felt fear in approaching someone you have offended or who has hurt you. And yet I have seen the Lord melt hearts time after time, including my own. And so I challenge you to go for the Lord to someone, despite any fear you may have, to extend love and forgiveness. I promise you that as you do, you will feel the love of the Savior for that person and His love for you, and it will not seem to come from a great distance. For you, that challenge may be in a family, it may be in a community, or it may be across a nation.\nBut if you go for the Lord to bless others, He will see and reward it. If you do this often enough and long enough, you will feel a change in your very nature through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Not only will you feel closer to Him, but you will also feel more and more that you are becoming like Him. Then, when you do see Him, as we all will, it will be for you as it was for Moroni when he said: \u201cAnd now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.\u201d9\nIf we serve with faith, humility, and a desire to do God\u2019s will, I testify that the judgment bar of the great Jehovah will be pleasing. We will see our loving Father and His Son as They see us now\u2014with perfect clarity and with perfect love. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring\nWhere Is the Pavilion?\n2012\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear sisters, I believe that you, like our priesthood brethren, have been \u201ccalled and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of \u2026 exceeding faith and good works, \u2026 having chosen good.\u201d Therefore you are \u201ccalled with a holy calling.\u201d (Alma 13:3.)\nWe stand in awe at Mary\u2019s assignment to be the mother of the Lord, but we, too, have been called to mother gods. Latter-day Saint women understand that the very purpose of creation depends upon our participation as earthly mothers to the spirit children of God.

Indeed, there is none greater.\nOur six children were young and completely dependent when my husband invited me to accompany him on a business trip. I had never before been far away from my nest of little ones. At first I was delighted, but as my departure drew near I became obsessed with fear. If something happened to me, what would become of them? I worked myself into such a frenzy that the night before I was to leave I spent the night composing a letter of instruction to one I prayed would care for them in case I didn\u2019t return. I listed all the things I felt were essential to their welfare, and then added a PS: \u201cPlease put your arms around them often.\u201d\nIf not my arms, then her arms\u2014for a mother\u2019s arms encircle a child with tender restraint, security, love. They protect against fear, harm, and evil.\nAs a mother I have made mistakes. Regardless of culture or country, we all make mistakes in our mothering. But through repentance and the atonement of Jesus Christ, and by continually communicating his love, miracles can happen, wrongs can be righted. Never give up. Never let your arms hang down.\nTo mothers raising children alone, remember that you and the Lord constitute a majority. As your arms encircle your little ones, his arms are there, too. Feel secure, for his arms are lengthened out toward us all the day long.\nElder John A. Widtsoe said: \u201cMotherhood may be exercised as universally and vicariously as Priesthood\u201d (Priesthood and Church Government, rev. ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1954, p. 85).\nFor those who have not yet borne a child\u2014exercise motherhood. Let your arms be an extension of the Savior\u2019s in providing love and security for all his children.\nOne mother who learned to put her trust in the arm of the Lord taught a son to do the same. Later, as a man bearing testimony to the power of prayer, he said: \u201cIt was through the example of my mother that I learned to depend on the Lord. Whenever we had an important decision to make, we would discuss the problem, and then my mother would say, \u2018Now, let\u2019s take it to the Lord.\u2019 I often came home to find housework left at a standstill and my mother kneeling in prayer. Friends coming into the house sometimes asked me, \u2018What is your mother doing?\u2019 I would say, \u2018She is taking a problem to the Lord.\u2019\u201d\nHis arms will be there when ours are not. Teach them to walk toward his arms.\nMy mother died three weeks before my first child was born. How I longed for her. My Relief Society sisters have been my mother. I have felt the Lord\u2019s arms encircled about me through sacred sisterhood, through enlightenment and training received in Relief Society.\nGod has called Latter-day Saint women to prepare his children for the challenges of the last days. In order to fulfill this calling, we must be both learners and teachers of eternal truths. We must study the scriptures that we might arm our children with knowledge of Jesus Christ and his gospel. We must guard our homes against any intrusion of evil. We must seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We must make our homes holy places in which to stand. Sisters, we must faithfully fulfill here the sacred trust we willingly accepted there.\nLet us learn and then teach that the Lord has given us a prophet to guide us back to him; learn and then teach that Jesus is the Christ, that he lives, and that our only security lies in his arms. To this I testify in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMary F. Foulger\nMotherhood and the Family\n1980\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, I am grateful to be a part of this vast assembly of priesthood bearers. I am also especially mindful of a wonderful little band of missionaries with whom my wife and I are currently blessed to labor in the New York Rochester Mission. Speaking perhaps for all mission presidents and the missionaries\u2019 parents, I wish to say during my temporary absence from them, \u201cPlease work hard, drive carefully, and be good!\u201d\nAll of us who hold the priesthood of God are involved in a glorious common cause\u2014helping our Father in Heaven bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (see Moses 1:39). This task, in its simplest form, involves qualifying ourselves for the blessings of the Savior\u2019s atonement and helping others to do the same.\nOver the years as I have struggled with my own weaknesses and have tried in my way to help others overcome theirs, I have received assistance and motivation from a variety of sources. Personal prayer, my knowledge of an interested, loving Father in Heaven and His Plan of Salvation, the scriptures, the temple, and the promptings of the Holy Ghost have been especially helpful. However, even more immediate than these in some ways have been the influence and inspiration provided by the lives of noble people. I am ever impressed and deeply moved by the power of even one good life.\nFrom among many exemplary lives in our rich history as a people, I wish to share examples from just two. The first is from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nDuring a bitter winter of imprisonment in Richmond, Missouri, Joseph and some fifty other brethren were subjected to great hardship and exposure. One of their greatest trials was to endure the blasphemies and filthy language of their guards as they boasted of their unspeakable cruelty to the Saints.\nOf one particularly tedious night, Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote:\n\u201cI had listened till I became so disgusted, shocked, horrified, and so filled with the spirit of indignant justice that I could scarcely refrain from rising upon my feet and rebuking the guards; but had said nothing to Joseph, or any one else, although I lay next to him and knew he was awake. On a sudden he arose to his feet, and spoke in a voice of thunder, or as the roaring lion, uttering, as near as I can recollect, the following words:\n\u201c\u2018SILENCE, ye fiends of the infernal pit. In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you or I die THIS INSTANT!\u2019\n\u201cHe ceased to speak. He stood erect in terrible majesty. Chained, and without a weapon; calm, unruffled and dignified as an angel, he looked upon the quailing guards, whose weapons were lowered or dropped to the ground; whose knees smote together, and who, shrinking into a corner, or crouching at his feet, begged his pardon, and remained quiet till a change of guards.\u201d\nElder Pratt continues:\n\u201cI have seen the ministers of justice, clothed in magisterial robes, and criminals arraigned before them, while life was suspended on a breath, in the Courts of England; I have witnessed a Congress in solemn session to give laws to nations; I have tried to conceive of kings, of royal courts, of thrones and crowns; and of emperors assembled to decide the fate of kingdoms; but dignity and majesty have I seen but once, as it stood in chains, at midnight, in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri\u201d (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, pp. 210\u201311).\nDoes not this image of the Prophet Joseph courageously rebuking the forces of evil move us to do likewise?\nThe second example is from the life of Willard Bean, a remarkable man who became known as the \u201cfighting parson.\u201d In the spring of 1915, Willard and his new bride, Rebecca, were called by President Joseph F. Smith to serve a mission for \u201cfive years or longer\u201d in Palmyra, New York. (Vicki Bean Topliff, Willard Bean, \u201cThe Fighting Parson\u201d, Huntington Beach, California, 1981, p. 87. For the account of their life in Palmyra, see pp. 86\u2013131.) Their task was to occupy the recently acquired Joseph Smith home and farm and to reestablish the Church in the hostile environment which still existed at the time in Palmyra.\nThe Beans were rebuffed on every front as they settled into the Smith home. The townspeople would not speak to them or wait on them in their stores. Passersby would pause in front of the home and shout obscenities. Their children were assigned to sit in the back corners of the schoolroom and were shunned by the other children in class.\nWillard, who was an accomplished athlete and had been a prize-winning boxer, decided to improve public relations by putting on a boxing exhibition in Palmyra. A ring was set up in an old opera house, and the \u201cfighting parson\u201d challenged all comers to a boxing match.\nWhen the night of the exhibition arrived, the toughest men in Palmyra sat in the first few rows. One by one they entered the ring, only to be carried out again in a matter of seconds! This continued until the seventh challenger was similarly disposed.\nBrother Bean\u2019s fighting abilities were more spontaneously employed on another occasion as he walked along the unfriendly streets of Palmyra. A man watering his front lawn one afternoon suddenly turned the hose on Willard and taunted: \u201cI understand you people believe in baptism by immersion.\u201d The spry, athletic Willard reportedly vaulted over the fence separating them and replied, \u201cYes, and we also believe in the laying on of hands!\u201d (Willard Bean, \u201cThe Fighting Parson,\u201d p. 14.)\nAlthough Brother Bean\u2019s methods were a little unorthodox and definitely not compatible with the current approved missionary program of the Church, they were nonetheless effective. The people of Palmyra began begrudgingly to yield and to accept the Beans as the good people they were. In time, they were invited to participate in local churches and to join the civic organizations of the day. They established a branch of the Church and helped acquire the Hill Cumorah and the Martin Harris and Peter Whitmer farms. The \u201cfive years or longer\u201d mission to which the prophet had called them stretched to nearly twenty-five years before it concluded. During that time, the attitude of the people of Palmyra had changed from hostility toward the Beans to toleration, then admiration, and finally to love. The power of good lives is truly great.\nI am personally greatly motivated by the modest written and oral traditions of my own fathers which have been handed down.\nFor instance, as a young boy, my great-grandfather arose one Christmas morning with great anticipation and came down from the loft where he slept to inspect the stocking he had hung by the fireplace the previous night. To his dismay he found what was to constitute his entire Christmas that year\u2014one piece of horehound candy! He was immediately faced with a weighty decision: Should he eat the candy in one glorious burst of flavor, or should he make it last? The scarcity of such delicacies apparently convinced him to make it last. He carefully licked the solitary piece of candy a few times and then wrapped it in tissue paper and hid it under his mattress. Each Sunday thereafter, following dinner, he retreated to his bed, retrieved his treasure, and enjoyed a few pleasurable licks. In that way he nursed the piece of candy through an entire year\u2019s enjoyment.\nThis is obviously not an account of deeds of heroic proportions. And yet, in these times of overindulgence and excess, it is somehow very inspiring and strengthening to me to know that a little of my great-grandfather\u2019s frugal blood flows in my own veins.\nThe Lord is surely aware of our need to feel the influence of good people. That may be one reason why He has established a pattern of companionships as we work together through the priesthood to serve Him and His children. That also may be why He has counseled that \u201cif any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also\u201d (D&C 84:106).\nI have personally experienced the benefit of such a priesthood apprenticeship. In my Aaronic Priesthood years, a man who this evening is a silver-haired stake patriarch became my \u201csenior\u201d home teaching companion. Under his wise tutelage, and in spite of considerable resistance on my part, I learned for the first time how to \u201cwarn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ\u201d (D&C 20:59). When the time later came at age nineteen for a full-time mission, I did not really need a missionary preparation course; I had had one! I thank God for the love and influence of such mentors.\nBefore concluding, I hope you will pardon a personal reference to my own father and the power of his good life in mine. For a half century now I have benefited from his wisdom, his generosity, and his goodness. I am not sure I realized the full extent of his influence until recently as I prepared to return home following the final session of a stake conference to which I had been assigned. An elderly brother came up from the congregation to meet me. He thanked me for coming, and then, in obvious reference to the many times I must have quoted my father and referred to his teachings during the conference sessions, he said: \u201cBrother Jensen, if you are ever assigned again to our stake, why don\u2019t you just send your father!\u201d My hope is that in some small way I will have a similar influence for lasting good in the lives of our own children.\nThe list of valiant people whose lives touch our own includes family members, missionary companions, friends, Church leaders, teachers, and associates from various walks of life. Some we know intimately and others only by reputation. Less obvious to most of us is the influence we may be having in the lives of others. This interaction, to me, is one of the reasons why a community of believing Latter-day Saints is a foundational element of the gospel. It also explains why we build meetinghouses rather than hermitages.\nIt is through the lives of good people that we at least in part become better acquainted with the greatest of all lives. When we see Christ\u2019s image in the countenances of others, it helps us live to receive it in our own.\nI thank God for the blessing of good people in all of our lives and pray that we may all in some small way serve that same purpose in the lives of others, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarlin K. Jensen\nThe Power of a Good Life\n1994\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "In an important message to the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo just one year before his tragic and untimely martyrdom, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:\n\u201cIf we would secure and cultivate the love of others, we must love others, even our enemies as well as friends. \u2026 Christians should cease wrangling and contending with each other, and cultivate the principles of union and friendship in their midst.\u201d (History of the Church, 5:498\u201399.)\nThat is magnificent counsel today, even as it was 150 years ago. The world in which we live, whether close to home or far away, needs the gospel of Jesus Christ. It provides the only way the world will ever know peace. We need to be kinder with one another, more gentle and forgiving. We need to be slower to anger and more prompt to help. We need to extend the hand of friendship and resist the hand of retribution. In short, we need to love one another with the pure love of Christ, with genuine charity and compassion and, if necessary, shared suffering, for that is the way God loves us.\nIn our worship services, we often sing a lovely hymn with text written by Susan Evans McCloud. May I recall a few lines of that hymn for you?\nSavior, may I learn to love thee,\nWalk the path that thou hast shown,\nPause to help and lift another,\nFinding strength beyond my own. \u2026\nWho am I to judge another\nWhen I walk imperfectly?\nIn the quiet heart is hidden\nSorrow that the eye can\u2019t see. \u2026\nI would be my brother\u2019s keeper;\nI would learn the healer\u2019s art.\nTo the wounded and the weary\nI would show a gentle heart.\nI would be my brother\u2019s keeper\u2014\nLord, I would follow thee.\nWe need to walk more resolutely and more charitably the path that Jesus has shown. We need to \u201cpause to help and lift another\u201d and surely we will find \u201cstrength beyond [our] own.\u201d If we would do more to learn \u201cthe healer\u2019s art,\u201d there would be untold chances to use it, to touch the \u201cwounded and the weary\u201d and show to all \u201ca gentle[r] heart.\u201d Yes, Lord, we should follow thee.\n\u201cA new commandment I give unto you,\u201d he said, \u201cThat ye love one another; \u2026 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d (John 13:34\u201335.) This love that we should have for our brothers and sisters in the human family, and that Christ has for every one of us, is called charity or \u201cthe pure love of Christ.\u201d (Moro. 7:47.) It is the love that prompted the suffering and sacrifice of Christ\u2019s atonement. It is the highest pinnacle the human soul can reach and the deepest expression of the human heart.\nWe have a feeling of appreciation that our women\u2019s Relief Society organization, celebrating this year its sesquicentennial anniversary, has always had as its theme \u201cCharity Never Faileth.\u201d Charity encompasses all other godly virtues. It distinguishes both the beginning and the end of the plan of salvation. When all else fails, charity\u2014Christ\u2019s love\u2014will not fail. It is the greatest of all divine attributes.\nOut of the abundance of his heart, Jesus spoke to the poor, the downtrodden, the widows, the little children; to farmers and fishermen, and those who tended goats and sheep; to strangers and foreigners, the rich, the politically powerful, as well as the unfriendly Pharisees and scribes. He ministered to the poor, the hungry, the deprived, the sick. He blessed the lame, the blind, the deaf, and other people with physical disabilities. He drove out the demons and evil spirits that had caused mental or emotional illness. He purified those who were burdened with sin. He taught lessons of love and repeatedly demonstrated unselfish service to others. All were recipients of his love. All were \u201cprivileged the one like unto the other, and none [were] forbidden.\u201d (2 Ne. 26:28.) These are all expressions and examples of his unbounded charity.\nThe world in which we live would benefit greatly if men and women everywhere would exercise the pure love of Christ, which is kind, meek, and lowly. It is without envy or pride. It is selfless because it seeks nothing in return. It does not countenance evil or ill will, nor rejoice in iniquity; it has no place for bigotry, hatred, or violence. It refuses to condone ridicule, vulgarity, abuse, or ostracism. It encourages diverse people to live together in Christian love regardless of religious belief, race, nationality, financial standing, education, or culture.\nThe Savior has commanded us to love one another as he has loved us; to clothe ourselves \u201cwith the bond of charity\u201d (D&C 88:125), as he so clothed himself. We are called upon to purify our inner feelings, to change our hearts, to make our outward actions and appearance conform to what we say we believe and feel inside. We are to be true disciples of Christ.\nAs a young man, Brother Vern Crowley said he learned something of the crucial lesson the Prophet Joseph had taught the early Saints in Nauvoo when he told them to \u201clove others, even our enemies as well as friends.\u201d This is a good lesson for each of us.\nAfter his father became ill, Vern Crowley took responsibility for running the family wrecking yard although he was only fifteen years of age. Some customers occasionally took unfair advantage of the young man, and parts were disappearing from the lot overnight. Vern was angry and vowed to catch someone and make an example of him. Vengeance would be his.\nJust after his father had started to recover from his illness, Vern was making his rounds of the yard one night at closing time. It was nearly dark. In a distant corner of the property, he caught sight of someone carrying a large piece of machinery toward the back fence. He ran like a champion athlete and caught the young thief. His first thought was to take out his frustrations with his fists and then drag the boy to the front office and call the police. His heart was full of anger and vengeance. He had caught his thief, and he intended to get his just dues.\nOut of nowhere, Vern\u2019s father came along, put his weak and infirm hand on his son\u2019s shoulder, and said, \u201cI see you\u2019re a bit upset, Vern. Can I handle this?\u201d He then walked over to the young would-be thief and put his arm around his shoulder, looked him in the eye for a moment, and said, \u201cSon, tell me, why are you doing this? Why were you trying to steal that transmission?\u201d Then Mr. Crowley started walking toward the office with his arm around the boy, asking questions about the young man\u2019s car problems as they walked. By the time they had arrived at the office, the father said, \u201cWell, I think your clutch is gone and that\u2019s causing your problem.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Vern was fuming. \u201cWho cares about his clutch?\u201d he thought. \u201cLet\u2019s call the police and get this over with.\u201d But his father just kept talking. \u201cVern, get him a clutch. Get him a throwout bearing, too. And get him a pressure plate. That should take care of it.\u201d The father handed all of the parts to the young man who had attempted robbery and said, \u201cTake these. And here\u2019s the transmission, too. You don\u2019t have to steal, young man. Just ask for it. There\u2019s a way out of every problem. People are willing to help.\u201d\nBrother Vern Crowley said he learned an everlasting lesson in love that day. The young man came back to the lot often. Voluntarily, month by month, he paid for all of the parts Vic Crowley had given him, including the transmission. During those visits he asked Vern why his dad was the way he was and why he did what he did. Vern told him something of their Latter-day Saint beliefs and how much his father loved the Lord and loved people. Eventually the would-be thief was baptized. Vern later said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard now to describe the feelings I had and what I went through in that experience. I, too, was young. I had caught my crook. I was going to extract the utmost penalty. But my father taught me a different way.\u201d\nA different way? A better way? A higher way? A more excellent way? Oh, how the world could benefit from such a magnificent lesson. As Moroni declares:\n\u201cWherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, \u2026\n\u201cIn the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way.\u201d (Ether 12:4, 11.)\nPresident David O. McKay once said:\n\u201cThe peace of Christ does not come by seeking the superficial things of life, neither does it come except as it springs from the individual\u2019s heart. Jesus said to his disciples: \u2018Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\u2019\u201d (Gospel Ideals, Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1953, pp. 39\u201340.)\nIn all the realms of daily living and in a world of so much need, we should so live that one day we will hear the King of Kings say to us:\n\u201cFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:\n\u201cNaked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\u201d (Matt. 25:35\u201336.)\nAnd if we should have occasion to say:\n\u201cLord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\n\u201cWhen saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?\n\u201cOr when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\u201d (Matt. 22:37\u201339.)\nThen I am certain we will hear this reply: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (Matt. 25:40.)\nWe need a more peaceful world, growing out of more peaceful families and neighborhoods and communities. To secure and cultivate such peace, \u201cwe must love others, even our enemies as well as our friends.\u201d The world needs the gospel of Jesus Christ. Those who are filled with the love of Christ do not seek to force others to do better; they inspire others to do better, indeed inspire them to the pursuit of God. We need to extend the hand of friendship. We need to be kinder, more gentle, more forgiving, and slower to anger. We need to love one another with the pure love of Christ. May this be our course and our desire.\nI add my witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that this is his church, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nHoward W. Hunter\nA More Excellent Way\n1992\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Last October my wife and I accompanied Elder and Sister Neil L. Andersen for the groundbreaking of a new temple in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. As is customary, a press conference followed the ceremony. A journalist, not a member of our church, commented that she had observed how well the men treated their wives. Then she unexpectedly asked, \u201cIs that real or fiction?\u201d I am sure that she saw and felt something different among our members. She might have perceived the desire of our members to follow Christ. Members all over the world have such a desire. At the same time, millions who are not members of the Church also have a desire to follow Him.\nRecently my wife and I were impressed by the people we saw in Ghana and Nigeria. Most were not members of our church. We were happy to see their desire to follow Christ expressed in many of their conversations in their houses, on their cars, on their walls, and on their billboards. We had never seen so many Christian churches next to one another.\nAs Latter-day Saints, ours is the duty to invite millions such as these to come and see what our church can add to the good things that they already have. Any person from any continent, climate, or culture can know for himself or herself that the Prophet Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son in a vision. He or she can know that heavenly messengers restored the priesthood and that the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ. In the words of the Lord to Enoch, \u201cRighteousness [has been sent] down out of heaven; and truth [has been sent] forth out of the earth to [testify of the] Only Begotten [of the Father].\u201d1\nThe Savior has promised, \u201cHe that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d2 Followers of Christ pattern their lives after the Savior to walk in the light. Two characteristics can help us recognize to what extent we follow Him. First, followers of Christ are loving people. Second, followers of Christ make and keep covenants.\nThe first characteristic, being loving, is probably one thing the journalist in C\u00f3rdoba noticed among our Church members. We follow Christ because we love Him. When we follow the Redeemer out of love, we are following His own example. Through love the Savior was obedient to the will of the Father under any circumstance. Our Savior was obedient even when it meant great physical and emotional pain, even when it meant being whipped and mocked, even when it meant that His enemies would torture Him while His friends abandoned Him. The atoning sacrifice, which is unique to the mission of the Savior, is the greatest expression of love ever. \u201cThe chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\u201d3\nAs Christ followed the Father under any circumstance, we should follow His Son. If we do so, it matters not what kind of persecution, suffering, grief, or \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d4 we face. We are not alone. Christ will assist us. His tender mercies will make us mighty under any circumstance.5\nFollowing Christ may mean forsaking many dear things, as Ruth the Moabite did. As a new convert, out of love for God and Naomi, she left everything behind to live her religion.6\nIt may also mean withstanding adversity and temptation. In his youth Joseph was sold into slavery. He was taken away from everything he loved. Later he was tempted to be unchaste. He resisted the temptation and said, \u201cHow then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d7 His love for God was more powerful than any adversity or temptation.\nToday we have modern Ruths and Josephs all over the world. When Brother Jimmy Olvera from Guayaquil, Ecuador, received his mission call, his family was struggling greatly. The day he was leaving, he was told that if he walked out the door, he would lose his family. With a broken heart he walked out that door. While he was on his mission, his mother asked him to stay longer in the field because they were receiving so many blessings. Today Brother Olvera serves as a stake patriarch.\nTruly loving Christ provides the required strength to follow Him. The Lord Himself showed this when He asked Peter three times, \u201cLovest thou me?\u201d After Peter reaffirmed his love for Him out loud, the Lord told Peter about upcoming difficulties. Then the admonition came: \u201cFollow me.\u201d The Savior\u2019s question to Peter can also be asked of us: \u201cLovest thou me?\u201d followed by the call to action: \u201cFollow me.\u201d8\nLove is a powerful influence in our hearts in our effort to be obedient. Love for our Savior inspires us to keep His commandments. Love for a mother, father, or spouse can also inspire our obedience to gospel principles. The way we treat others reflects to what extent we follow our Savior in loving one another.9 We show our love for Him when we stop to assist others, when we are \u201cperfectly honest and upright in all things,\u201d10 and when we make and keep covenants.\nThe second characteristic that followers of Christ have is making and keeping covenants, as He did. Moroni pointed out that \u201cthe shedding of the blood of Christ \u2026 is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.\u201d11\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith taught that even before the organization of this earth, covenants were made in heaven.12 Ancient prophets and patriarchs made covenants.\nThe Savior Himself gave the example. He was baptized to fulfill all righteousness by one with the proper authority. Through His baptism, the Savior witnessed unto the Father that He would be obedient in keeping all the Father\u2019s commandments.13 As in days of old, we also follow Christ and make covenants through priesthood ordinances.\nMaking covenants is something that millions who are not members of our church can add to the very good things that they already have. Making covenants is an expression of love. It is a way of saying to Him, \u201cYes, I will follow Thee because I love Thee.\u201d\nCovenants include promises, \u201ceven of life eternal.\u201d14 All things will work together for our good if we remember our covenants.15 They must be made and kept to fully receive the promises they provide. Love for the Savior and remembering our covenants will help us keep them. Partaking of the sacrament is one way to remember them.16 Another way is to attend the temple often. I remember a young married couple in South America who wanted to separate because they could not get along. A priesthood leader counseled them to attend the temple and pay specific attention to the words and promises of the covenants made there. They did so and their marriage was saved. The power of our covenants is greater than any challenge we face or we may face.\nTo those members who are not active in the gospel, please come back. Feel the blessing of remembering and renewing covenants through the sacrament and temple attendance. Doing so is an expression of love and shows a willingness to be a true follower of Christ. It will qualify you to receive all the promised blessings.\nTo those who are not members of our church, I invite you to exercise faith, repent, and qualify to receive the covenant of baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. By doing so, you will show your love to our Heavenly Father and your willingness to follow Christ.\nI testify that we are happier when we follow the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As we strive to follow Him, the blessings of heaven will come unto us. I know His promises will be fulfilled as we make and keep covenants and become true followers of Christ. I testify of His great love for each one of us, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nWalter F. Gonz\u00e1lez\nFollowers of Christ\n2011\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "What a tremendous sight to look out at this Conference Center filled to capacity and think of the buildings all over the world filled with the priesthood. Probably this would be the largest gathering of the priesthood in the history of the Church. I would imagine that would be true because we continue to grow every year.\nMy first brush with the priesthood was when I was baptized. I was baptized in an irrigation canal in the little town of Oakley, Idaho. I was with my friends on the bank of that irrigation canal. We had on our bib swimming suits, which consisted of bib overalls with the legs cut out so you wouldn\u2019t sink and holes cut in the pockets. We had never seen a swimming suit made out of knit or of other fabric. My father came out from the First Ward meetinghouse with his counselors. He was carrying a chair, and he put the chair on the side of the irrigation ditch. My father said, \u201cDavid, come on over here; we\u2019re going to baptize you.\u201d\nI dove in the canal and swam over to the other side, shivering. It was in September and a little cold, and young boys get the shivers, you know, when you have only bib overalls on. My father got down into the canal. As I remember, he didn\u2019t take his shoes off or change anything but was just in his regular clothes. He showed me how to hold my hands, and then he baptized me. After I came up out of the water, we both crawled up on the bank of the canal. I sat in the chair, and they put their hands on my head and confirmed me a member of the Church. After that I dove in the canal and went over on the other side and joined my friends.\nThis was my first experience, really, with the priesthood.\nI would remind you that the priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man. Let me say that again: The priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man. Here in these assemblies tonight, we have those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood, the lesser priesthood, and then the Melchizedek Priesthood, the higher priesthood. Isn\u2019t it interesting to visualize how the Lord and His Heavenly Father, in setting up the plan of salvation, organized it so that men could be worthy enough and could be honored to hold the priesthood and join in the large army of men necessary to bring about the eternal purposes of our Heavenly Father, to bring about the immortality and eternal life of man\u2014mankind everywhere? What a mighty group that would entail!\nA few years after I had been baptized, becoming better acquainted with some duties in the Church, I was ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood. My father, who had baptized me, had died in the meantime with a heart attack, so the bishop conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon me and ordained me to the office of a deacon. I remember that I had a wonderful feeling about that as he conferred the priesthood upon me, that I now had responsibilities and would be accountable for my actions and would have things to learn to do as I would progress through life. I did have a special feeling that I now was a little different, that I wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same as friends who did not hold the priesthood or people that you would meet out in the world. I now had some responsibilities, things we would learn on Sundays in church as we would sit around the old coal stove down in the basement of the meetinghouse.\nOn Saturdays, we would clean out the church, fill the coal buckets with coal, and see that the building was ready for Sunday meetings. We had things to do in the lesser priesthood, in all the temporal affairs of the ward\u2014collecting fast offerings and doing duties for the bishop. He and other leaders would teach us about the Aaronic Priesthood and the office of a deacon, then a teacher, and then, of course, a priest as we would advance in the priesthood. It seemed to me that I was developing an interesting understanding, a vision of the work to be done, and that I personally had some responsibility, even though I was just a young boy in a little country town. There was something very important about it.\nWhen I was 11 years old, my father died, and at his funeral I was very touched as I heard the people speaking about what a kind man he had been. At the cemetery as they were lowering the casket down in the grave and starting to throw those shovels full of dirt and rocks down on the casket, I stood watching, thinking he was my hero, and I wondered what would ever happen to me having lost my father. I saw good men exercising the priesthood and doing what was right\u2014the men who had helped in digging the grave and taking care of things\u2014and I saw a good man push a five-dollar bill back into the hands of my mother, who had offered him some money for helping to dig the grave. He pushed that money back towards my mother and said, \u201cNo, you keep it because you will need this later on.\u201d\nAnd so, I would like to declare to all of you in these assemblies tonight, in the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood, isn\u2019t it interesting in the wisdom of our Heavenly Father and His Son, in putting all of these things together, how in the lesser priesthood we learn to do the temporal chores? We\u2019ll have temporal duties, learning in a humble, simple way those things that need to be done. This will teach us of service and of living the commandments of the Lord, preparing us so that we someday will be advanced to the Melchizedek Priesthood, with all of the majesty and the eternal glory that that entails.\nThose Aaronic Priesthood years were interesting years in my life. I was always learning new things and always getting a little broader concept and feeling about the gospel and our responsibility in carrying this message out to all the world. In that process we learned to mingle with other people. Sometimes we have the feeling that people might not accept us because we have higher standards. There are things that we don\u2019t do. We have the Word of Wisdom, which helps us to live a healthier life, a type of life that is conducive to our growing into manhood and having the standards and ideals and a way of living that most of the world would like to have. I found that if you live the way you should live, people notice it and are impressed with your beliefs, and then you have an influence on other people\u2019s lives. When they find out that they don\u2019t have to indulge in the smoking or the drinking or the pot, the drugs that are affecting the world so negatively, the fact that you don\u2019t do that has an influence on those people.\nMaintaining your standards qualifies you for marriage in the temple. Incidentally, this is the 173rd Annual General Conference of the Church, and for just a bit of trivia, my wife and I have been married 73 years. So the year we were married, the Church would have been holding the 100th annual conference. I can remember that as I was holding Ruby\u2019s hand across the altar of the temple\u2014listening to the words of the sealing ceremony\u2014I had a special feeling in my heart, not only of the sacredness of it but of the responsibility I had to live as I should live, to take care of her and our children, and then our grandchildren, and then the other generations that would come along. I was determined to set an example of living the way a person can live in honoring the priesthood and our marriage covenant.\nTonight while we meet as priesthood holders, just think of the responsibility each one of us has as we consider what has to come about in this world\u2014probably new things that we are not aware of today\u2014after this war is over and things have been put back the way they should be. There\u2019s so much for us to do. For us to do it, we need to be worthy of the priesthood that we have so that we can help in leading out as the Church moves on, perhaps in a broader way than we\u2019ve ever done before. What a day that will be!\nA few years ago, when I was in the navy during World War II, I received orders to report to the fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor. My family took me to Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay, where I boarded the plane there, an old sea plane called a Pan-American clipper. On board that plane were some high-ranking medical officers going out to prepare and build up the hospital support because the battle of Tarawa would be taking place within a few weeks. Because of my rank, I was assigned to sleep in a sleeping bag out in the tail of that plane, where I could see the starboard engines as we were flying over San Francisco, which was under military blackout. It was black as we were flying out into the Pacific, and I thought the starboard engine on that old Pan-American plane was on fire. I couldn\u2019t sleep as I watched it throughout the entire flight.\nDuring that sleepless night I wondered about my own life and whether I had been living up to the opportunities that would be mine and the responsibility that would be mine as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood\u2014the responsibility to be an example and to live the way I should so that I would be able to fulfill the calls that might come to me. In that sleepless night I took an inventory of myself, of my attitudes, wondering if I was doing all that I might. Even though I had always accepted my Church assignments, I wondered if I was fulfilling them with all of my heart, might, mind, and soul and living up to the responsibility, the blessing, that I received as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood and what would be expected of any of us who received this blessing.\nLooking back on that sleepless night, I thank the Lord for His blessings today and for all that I have had the opportunity to be involved in. I try always to live the gospel to the fullest, to do everything I am called on to do with all of my heart, might, mind, and strength, to fulfill any call that might come to me so I may be qualified to do whatever I might be asked to do someday.\nOn this night when we are honoring the priesthood, you young men of the priesthood, resolve to live the way you should. Don\u2019t be caught up in some of the silly things that are going on in the world, but bear in mind what has been given to you. I will repeat again, priesthood is the power and authority delegated to man by our Heavenly Father. The authority and the majesty of it are beyond our comprehension.\nI bear you my witness, my testimony, that this work is true. I\u2019m glad to be able, in the twilight of my life, to stand and bear witness of the truthfulness of the gospel, as I have witnessed it all the days of my life from my baptism on until the present time. I love the Lord. I love our Heavenly Father and this work. I bear witness to the truthfulness of this work.\nAnd to all of you priesthood leaders, live as you should. We are different, and it is not good for you to be like everybody else because you hold the priesthood of God, with those great promises and blessings and expectations of you.\nThis work is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDavid B. Haight\nGrowing into the Priesthood\n2003\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "There are times when words cannot express what we feel. I pray that the Spirit will witness to your hearts your divine identity and your eternal responsibility. You are the hope of Israel. You are elect and royal daughters of our loving Heavenly Father.\nLast month I had the opportunity to attend the temple wedding of a young woman I have known since she was born. As I sat in the sealing room, looking at the beautiful chandelier sparkling in the light of the temple, I remembered that day when I first held her. Her mother had her dressed in a little white dress, and I thought she was one of the most beautiful babies I had ever seen. Then this young woman walked through the door, once again dressed in white. She was radiant and happy. As she entered the room, I wished with all my heart that every young woman could envision that moment and strive to always be worthy to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances of the temple in preparation to enjoy the blessings of exaltation.\nAs this couple knelt at the sacred altar, they received promises beyond mortal comprehension that will bless, strengthen, and assist them on their mortal journey. It was one of those moments when the world stood still and all of heaven rejoiced. As the newly married couple looked into the large mirrors in the room, the groom was asked what he saw. He said, \u201cAll those who have gone before me.\u201d Then the couple looked into the large mirror on the opposite wall, and the bride said with tears in her eyes, \u201cI see all those who will follow after us.\u201d She saw her future family\u2014her posterity. I know that she understood again in that moment how important it is to believe in being chaste and virtuous. There is no more beautiful sight than a couple, properly prepared, kneeling together at the altar of the temple.\nYour years in Young Women will prepare you for the temple. There you will receive the blessings to which you are entitled as a precious daughter of God. Your Heavenly Father loves you and wants you to be happy. The way to do this is to \u201cwalk in the paths of virtue\u201d1 and \u201ccleave unto [your] covenants.\u201d2\nYoung women, in a world ever growing in moral pollution, tolerance of evil, exploitation of women, and distortion of roles, you must stand guard of yourself, your family, and all those with whom you associate. You must be guardians of virtue.\nWhat is virtue and what is a guardian? \u201cVirtue is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. It includes chastity and [moral] purity.\u201d3 And what is a guardian? A guardian is someone who protects, shields, and defends.4 Thus, as a guardian of virtue, you will protect, shield, and defend moral purity because the power to create mortal life is a sacred and exalted power and must be safeguarded until you are married. Virtue is a requirement to have the companionship and guidance of the Holy Ghost. You will need that guidance in order to successfully navigate the world in which you live. Being virtuous is a requirement to enter the temple. And it is a requirement to be worthy to stand in the Savior\u2019s presence. You are preparing now for that time. Personal Progress and the standards found in For the Strength of Youth are important. Living the principles found in each booklet will strengthen and help you become \u201cmore fit for the kingdom.\u201d5\nLast summer a group of young women from Alpine, Utah, decided that they would become \u201cmore fit for the kingdom.\u201d They determined to focus on the temple by walking from the Draper Utah Temple to the Salt Lake Temple, a total distance of 22 miles (35 km), just as one of the pioneers, John Rowe Moyle, had done. Brother Moyle was a stonemason who was called by the prophet, Brigham Young, to work on the Salt Lake Temple. Each week he walked the distance of 22 miles from his home to the temple. One of his jobs was to carve the words \u201cHoliness to the Lord\u201d on the east side of the Salt Lake Temple. It was not easy and he had many obstacles to overcome. At one point, he was kicked in the leg by one of his cows. Because it would not heal, he had to have this leg amputated. But that did not stop him from his commitment to the prophet and to work on the temple. He carved a wooden leg, and after many weeks he again walked the 22-mile distance to the temple to do the work he had committed to do.6\nThe young women in the Cedar Hills Sixth Ward decided to walk that same distance for an ancestor and also for someone who was their inspiration to remain worthy to enter the temple. They trained each week at Mutual, and as they walked, they shared what they were learning and feeling about temples.\nThey began their walk to the temple early in the morning with a prayer. As they started out, I was impressed with their confidence. They had prepared well, and they knew they were prepared. Their eyes were set on their goal. Each step they took was symbolic of each of you as you too are preparing now to enter the temple. Your personal training has begun with your daily personal prayers, your daily reading of the Book of Mormon, and your working on Personal Progress.\nAs these young women continued to walk, there were distractions along the course, but they stayed focused on their goal. Some began to feel blisters forming, and others felt knees starting to protest, but they kept going. For each of you, there are many distractions, hurts, and obstacles along your path to the temple, but you too are determined and keep going. The route these young women took was mapped out by their leaders, who had walked and driven the course and determined the safest and most direct way to go. Again, your course is marked, and you can be assured that the Savior has not only walked the course but will again walk it with you\u2014every step of the way.\nAlong this journey to the temple there were fathers, mothers, family members, and priesthood leaders acting as guardians. Their job was to ensure that everyone was safe and protected from danger. They made sure each young woman stayed well hydrated and had enough nourishment to maintain her stamina. There were aid stations provided by their priesthood leaders, with places to rest and to drink water. Young women, your fathers, your mothers, your bishops, and so many others will be your guardians as you walk your path to the temple. They will call out cautions and direct your course, and should you become injured or hurt or get off course, they will help you.\nI was impressed that in the final miles of their walk, brothers, other young men, and friends came to support these determined young women and to cheer them on. One brother lifted his sister, who had large blisters on her feet, and carried her on his back the final distance to the temple. As these incredible young women reached their goal, tears were shed as they touched the temple and made a silent commitment to always be worthy to enter there.\nThe temple walk is a metaphor for your life. Parents and priesthood leaders stood guard along the route. They provided support and aid. Young women guarded and encouraged each other. Young men admired the strength, commitment, and stamina of the young women. Brothers carried sisters who had been injured. Families rejoiced with their daughters as they ended their walk at the temple and took them safely home.\nIn order to stay on the path to the temple, you must guard your personal virtue and the virtue of others with whom you associate. Why? Mormon taught in the Book of Mormon that virtue and chastity are \u201cmost dear and precious above all things.\u201d7\nWhat can each of you do to be a guardian of virtue? It starts with believing you can make a difference. It starts with making a commitment. When I was a young woman, I learned that some decisions need to be made only once. I wrote my list of things I would always do and things I would never do in a small tablet. It included things like obeying the Word of Wisdom, praying daily, paying my tithing, and committing to never miss church. I made those decisions once, and then in the moment of decision, I knew exactly what to do because I had decided beforehand. When my high school friends said, \u201cJust one drink won\u2019t hurt,\u201d I laughed and said, \u201cI decided when I was 12 not to do that.\u201d Making decisions in advance will help you be guardians of virtue. I hope each of you will write a list of things you will always do and things you will never do. Then live your list.\nBeing a guardian of virtue means you will always be modest not only in your dress but also in your speech, your actions, and your use of social media. Being a guardian of virtue means you will never text words or images to young men that may cause them to lose the Spirit, lose their priesthood power, or lose their virtue. It means that you understand the importance of chastity because you also understand that your body is a temple and that the sacred powers of procreation are not to be tampered with before marriage. You understand that you possess a sacred power that involves the holy responsibility of bringing other spirits to earth to receive a body in which to house their eternal spirit. This power involves another sacred soul. You are a guardian of something \u201cmore precious than rubies.\u201d8 Be faithful. Be obedient. Prepare now so that you may qualify to receive all the blessings that await you in the Lord\u2019s holy temples.\nFor the mothers listening tonight, you are your daughters\u2019 most important example of modesty and virtue\u2014thank you. Never hesitate to teach them that they are royal daughters of God and that their value is not based on their sensual appeal. And let them see your belief modeled correctly and consistently in your own personal attitude and appearance.9 You are also guardians of virtue.\nThis week I again climbed Ensign Peak. It was early in the morning, and as I looked down from that mount at the mountain of the Lord\u2019s house\u2014the Salt Lake Temple\u2014it was again crystal clear. The pioneers gave everything they had to come to the tops of the mountains so that you and I could have the blessings of the temple and be sealed eternally as families. Forty years of sacrifice, painstaking work, and even walking from Alpine to the temple\u2014why? Because, like you, they believed! They believed in a prophet. They believed he had seen and talked with God and His Beloved Son. They believed in the Savior. They believed in the Book of Mormon. That\u2019s why they could say, \u201cWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things.\u201d10 They endured many things and so can we. The thirteenth article of faith is what we believe because those are the very things that qualify us to be worthy to enter the temple and to one day stand in our Heavenly Father\u2019s presence\u2014proven, pure, and sealed. This will require that you be \u201cmore fit for the kingdom\u201d and that you prepare now and gain the confidence that you can do hard things.\nYoung women, you are engaged in a great work! And you are not alone! As you guard your virtue and purity, you will be given strength. As you keep the covenants you have made, the Holy Ghost will guide and guard you. You will be surrounded by heavenly hosts of angels. President Thomas S. Monson reminds us, \u201cRemember that we do not run alone in this great race of life; we are entitled to the help of the Lord.\u201d11 Prepare for that day when you will come to the Lord\u2019s temple worthy and prepared to make sacred covenants. As guardians of virtue, you will want to seek the Savior in His holy house.\nI testify that God lives and that His Beloved Son, our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, lives and because of the redeeming and enabling power of His infinite Atonement, each of you will be guided and guarded on your path to the temple and back into Their presence. I pray that each of you will be strengthened for that work which will be your finest hour. Live for that beautiful day spoken of in the book of Revelation when you will \u201cwalk \u2026 in white: [because you] are worthy.\u201d12 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElaine S. Dalton\nGuardians of Virtue\n2011\nGeneral Young Women Meeting\n"}, {"text": "Alexander Solzhenitsyn referred to shortsighted concessions: \u201cA process of giving up and giving up and giving up and hoping and hoping and hoping that perhaps at some point the wolf will have had enough.\u201d\nMy wonderful young friends, let me promise you, the wolf will never have enough.\nOliver Wendell Holmes said: \u201cWhere the spirit invades the heart, there can be no rest. For even in the dark of night, one link of the chain still holds, one light that will not go out.\u201d\nDoesn\u2019t it make you deeply grateful to belong to a church with apostles and prophets at the head\u2014knowing that one link will always hold, one light will never go out? As the world moves deeper and deeper into sin, this wonderful Church stands like a giant granite boulder.\nAren\u2019t you proud that the Church teaches us the truth? We don\u2019t have to wonder about earrings for boys and men, tattoos, spiked hair, the four-letter words, and obscene gestures. We have prophets who model the standards. They teach that the Ten Commandments are not outdated. The word of the Lord has thundered down through the generations: \u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\u201d (Ex. 20:7). Profaning God\u2019s name is a great offense to the Spirit, and to do so is Satan\u2019s great ploy to mock our God.\nJehovah also declared, \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d (Ex. 20:15). Stealing is an affront to God. This commandment is one of only 10. Cheating, lying, bearing false witness are all types of stealing.\nBeloved youth, aren\u2019t you thankful to God that the apostles and prophets never waver on sin? No matter how strong the winds of public opinion may blow, the Church is immovable. \u201cGod has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\u201d1\nThose who espouse perverse principles and deviant behavior are living in sin. Laws, consensus, consenting adults that teach contrary to the gospel are wrong even if the majority accepts them. Sin is sin, and that is God\u2019s truth. The Apostle Paul declared, \u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\u201d (1 Cor. 3:16).\nPornography is evil. I love the story told at the funeral of Henry Eyring\u2019s father. When he was a young man coming across the border from the Mexican colonies to the United States, the customs man said, \u201cSon, do you have any pornography in your suitcase or trunks?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo sir, we don\u2019t even own a pornograph.\u201d It\u2019s wonderful to be that pure and naive. We know pornography is addictive and destructive. It has companions it travels with: drinking, smoking, and drugs. It uses some types of music, dancing, the Internet, and television. Those who produce it are godless and have no conscience. They know the consequences, but they don\u2019t care. Like those who peddle drugs, they will never be around to pick up the pieces when you\u2019re all broken up. But we will\u2014your parents, bishops, and leaders.\nBe careful who you make your close friends. Two men were talking, and one said, \u201cHey, Joe, I passed your house the other day.\u201d And Joe said, \u201cThanks.\u201d Be grateful if you are not included in the wrong groups. There will always be a strong warning come to you beforehand.\nRudyard Kipling said:\nNow this is the Law of the Jungle\u2014as old and as true as the sky;\nAnd the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.\nAs the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back\u2014\nFor the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.2\nYour friends are a safeguard.\nA word to adults and parents. Elder Bruce R. McConkie\u2019s father counseled that when we violate any commandment, however small, our youth may choose to violate a commandment later on in life perhaps 10 times or 100 times worse and justify it on the basis of the small commandment we broke.3\nOne of the most important influences on the religiosity of our youth is the spontaneous religious discussions in our homes. When we discuss the things we love most, not because they are scheduled\u2014i.e., family home evening, prayer, or scripture study\u2014but just because they are so precious to us, they have a profound influence on our children.\nGrady Bogue, college professor, said: \u201cRightly done, teaching is a precious work. It is, however, the one human endeavor most damaging in consequence when done without care or competence. To carry a student in harm\u2019s way because of either ignorance or arrogance\u2014because we do not know or do not care\u2014is an act far worse than a bungled surgery. Our mistakes will not bleed. Instead, they carry hidden scars whose mean and tragic consequence may not be seen until years have passed and remedy is painful and impossible.\u201d4\nYouth, do not feel oppressed by obedience. Obedience is a wonderful and a great privilege. In Abraham 4:18 [Abr. 4:18] it states, \u201cAnd the Gods watched those things which they had ordered until they obeyed.\u201d What if the elements had not obeyed? They would have been damned or held back. So it is with us. Obedience to God is truly the only way to really be free and exercise our agency. Satan teaches the opposite and, with each wrong choice, binds us with chains. I promise you, obedience is a wonderful privilege.\nWhen I was a boy, my mother had to go to work at Garfield Smelter and work like a man to help support the seven children. She worked the graveyard shift as much as she could, I\u2019m sure to be with us during the day. I don\u2019t know when the poor woman slept. One Saturday morning, she got off work about 7:00 or 8:00 A.M. She went to bed for a couple of hours and then got up. She had invited all her relatives to dinner. There must have been 35 or 40. She decorated the tables and arranged the chairs and put all the dishes and silverware out. She cooked and baked all day long. The dirty pots and pans and dishes stacked up.\nEveryone came to dinner, and after dinner all the dirty dishes were brought into the kitchen. The food was cleared and stacked on the table and cupboards; then the kitchen door was closed and the family began to visit. It was about 8:00 P.M.\nI remember standing all alone in the kitchen. In my young mind, I thought: My mother worked all night; she has worked all day to get this dinner. When everyone leaves, she will have to do the dishes and put the food away. It will take two or three hours, and that\u2019s not fair. Then I thought, I will do them.\nI washed the dishes, did the silverware, the glassware. We didn\u2019t have an electric dishwasher; ours was a manual dishwasher, and that night I was manual. I used a half-dozen dish towels. I was drenched from head to foot. I put the food away, cleaned off the table and drainboards; then I got down on my hands and knees and scrubbed the floor. When I was finished, I thought the kitchen was immaculate. It took about three hours.\nThen I heard the chairs shuffling, and everyone left. The front door closed, and I heard my mother coming to the kitchen. I was pleased and thought she would be. The door swung open, and even at the age of 11, I recognized that she was startled. She looked around the kitchen, looked at me, and then there was a look I didn\u2019t recognize at the time. I do now. It was something like \u201cThanks. I am tired. I think you understand, and I love you.\u201d And she came over and hugged me. There was a light in her eye and a warmth in my heart. I learned it is a wonderful feeling to turn on the lights in our parents\u2019 eyes.\nAnother time\u2014it was the Sunday before Thanksgiving, about 1943\u2014I went to priesthood meeting. There was a large framed board. It had the pictures of all the young men serving in the military. Priests who had been at the sacrament table a few months earlier were now in the war. Each week it would be updated. Those who were killed in action had a gold star by their picture; those who had been wounded, a red star; and those missing in action, a white star. Every week, as a 12-year-old deacon, I checked to see who had been killed or wounded.\nIn quorum meeting that morning, the member of the bishopric said: \u201cThis Thursday is Thanksgiving. We ought to all have family prayer in our homes.\u201d Then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s put on the blackboard the things we are grateful for.\u201d We did, and he said, \u201cInclude these things in your Thanksgiving prayer.\u201d I got sick to my stomach, as we never had a prayer or blessing.\nThat night at 6:30 we went to sacrament meeting. At the end of the meeting, the bishop stood up and was very tender. He told about the young men from our ward who had been killed and wounded. He talked about our liberty, our freedom, our flag, and this great country, and our blessings. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019d hope every single family would kneel and have family prayer on Thanksgiving Day and thank God for His blessings.\u201d\nMy heart ached. I thought, How can we have family prayer? I wanted to be obedient. I hardly slept all Sunday night. I wanted to have a prayer for Thanksgiving. I even thought I would say it if someone asked me, but I was too shy to volunteer. I worried all day Monday, and all day Tuesday, and Wednesday at school.\nDad did not come home on Wednesday until early in the morning. Thursday we all got up. There were five boys and two sisters. We skipped breakfast so we would have a real appetite for Thanksgiving dinner. To work up an appetite, we went to a nearby field and dug a hole six feet deep and six feet wide. We made a trench to it as a hideout. I remember with every shovelful of dirt, I thought, Please, Heavenly Father, let us have a prayer.\nFinally at 2:30, my mother called us to come and eat. We cleaned up and sat at the table. Somehow Mom had managed to have a turkey with all the trimmings. She put all the food on the table, including the turkey. I thought my heart would burst. Time was running out. I looked at my father, then my mother. I thought, Please, now, someone, anyone, please can\u2019t we have a prayer. I was almost panicky; then all of a sudden everyone started to eat. I had worked hard all morning and afternoon to work up an appetite, but I wasn\u2019t hungry. I didn\u2019t want to eat. I wanted to pray more than anything else in this world, and it was too late.\nBeloved youth, be grateful for parents who have prayer and read the scriptures. Prize family home evening. Be grateful for those who teach and train you.\nMy young friends, there is so much that is wonderful, worthwhile in this grand world. I love President Hinckley\u2019s constant reference to the love and confidence, the greatness, that he feels in you, our beloved youth.\nPrepare to go to the temple. A wonderful verse describes it:\nEnter this door as if the floor \u2026 were gold;\nAnd every wall of jewels all of wealth untold;\nAs if a choir in robes of fire were singing here;\nNor shout nor rush but hush \u2026 for God is here.5\nAnd President Joseph F. Smith taught: \u201cAfter we have done all we could do for the cause of truth, and withstood the evil that men have brought upon us, and we have been overwhelmed by their wrongs, it is still our duty to stand. We cannot give up; we must not lie down. Great causes are not won in a single generation.\u201d6\nYoung men and young women, raise the standard; carry the torch for your generation. We have absolute confidence you will.\nI thank God for the one link that still holds, the one light that will not go out. Remember how blessed you are to have prayer in your homes. And always try to put lights in your mothers\u2019 eyes. That\u2019s the least we can all do for them.\nWe love you, our beloved youth, and pray God to bless each one of you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nVaughn J. Featherstone\nOne Link Still Holds\n1999\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brethren and sisters, as I stand before you here today I seek an interest in your faith and prayers as I deliver the things that I have in my heart.\nMarriage in the temple for time and eternity should be the goal of every member of the Church, for marriage is ordained of God. Marriage is a commandment. Marriage was instituted by divine edict.\nThe Lord said: \u201cAnd again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.\n\u201cWherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;\n\u201cAnd that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.\u201d (D&C 49:15\u201317.)\nMarriage is a sacred relationship entered into primarily for the rearing of a family, in fulfillment of the commandments of the Lord.\nMarriage with children, and the beautiful family relationship which can come of it, is the fulfillment of life. If things were as they should be, we would see a mother and father in a home having been married in the temple for time and eternity. The father honoring his priesthood, presiding in his home in righteousness. Father and mother loving each other and their children. Children loving and respecting each other and mother and father. All actively engaged in their church responsibilities. The Lord intended that marriage performed for eternity in the temple should endure forever. This was his plan. President Joseph Fielding Smith has said: \u201cMarriage, as understood by Latter-day Saints, is a covenant ordained to be everlasting. It is the foundation for eternal exaltation, for without it there could be no eternal progress in the kingdom of God.\u201d (Doctrines of Salvation [Bookcraft, 1967], vol. 2, p. 58.)\n\u201cWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\u201d (Mark 10:9.) It is evident from the scriptures that marriage performed in the Lord\u2019s way should not be dissolved.\nIt is sad, indeed, to see how lightly some take their marriage vows. There is great concern among the Brethren as to the increasing number of divorces in the Church today.\nEven though the divorce rate among members of the Church is considerably less than the national rate, and the rate of divorce among those married in the temple is less than with those married civilly, yet the rate is alarmingly high.\nDivorce is usually the result of one or both not living the gospel. I suppose this is the same reason divorce was finally permitted in the time of Moses, as referred to by the Savior as he answered the Pharisees, when he said: \u201cMoses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.\u201d (Matt. 19:8.) And so in our day members do not abide by the law of the gospel in its fullness, and, as in the day of Moses, divorce is permitted, when deemed necessary, although it was never intended to be.\nIf, in marriage, both parties would make gospel standards and principles the basis of their marriage, few problems would arise they could not handle. When one or the other or both begin to compromise gospel standards, problems follow. Marriage is a sacred relationship, and good members of the Church would know that it is entered into primarily for the rearing of a family. Other important desires and plans in marriage should be well understood by both parties as well.\nPresident McKay said, in reference to the seriousness with which we enter the marriage contract: \u201c\u2026 to look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure in response to a romantic whim, or for selfish purposes, and severed at the first difficulty or misunderstanding that may arise, is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation.\u201d (Quoted in Blaine R. Porter, The Latter-day Saint Family [Deseret Book Co., 1966], pp. 402\u2013403.)\nPossibly to list some of the most common causes for which civil divorces are sought might be helpful in avoiding these problems: incompatibility, adultery, money matters, physical abuse, dishonesty, not living the gospel, infidelity, not honoring priesthood, desertion, constant bickering, apathy, drunkenness, uncontrolled temper.\nIncompatibility has come to be such a common word, it seems to be the justification for many problems. I\u2019m sure there are occasions where this is justified, but what is incompatibility? Doesn\u2019t this indicate selfishness? Are we truly unselfish, do we love our neighbor as ourself when we are not compatible? Have we made every effort to compromise our likes and dislikes with those of our spouse? If we were truly living the gospel, there would be much less incompatibility.\nPresident McKay said of incompatibility, \u201cFor a couple who have basked in the sunshine of each other\u2019s love to stand by daily and see the clouds of misunderstanding and discord obscure the lovelight of their lives is tragedy indeed. In the darkness that follows, the love sparkle in each other\u2019s eyes is obscured. To restore it, fruitless attempts are made to say the right word and to do the right thing; but the word and act are misinterpreted, and angry retort reopens the wound, and hearts once united become torn wider and wider asunder. When this heartbreaking state is reached, a separation is sought.\u201d (Gospel Ideals [Improvement Era, 1953], p. 469.)\nI have been shocked in learning the extent to which men are physically abusive to women. In the October conference of 1951 President McKay said, \u201cI cannot imagine a man\u2019s being cruel to a woman. I cannot imagine her so conducting herself as to merit such treatment. Perhaps there are women in the world who exasperate their husbands, but no man is justified in resorting to physical force or in exploding his feelings in profanity. There are men, undoubtedly, in the world who are thus beastly, but no man who holds the priesthood of God should so debase himself.\u201d (Gospel Ideals, p. 476.)\nThe matter of disinterest, lack of voluntary expression, lack of affection are common causes for breakdown of marriage. President Harold B. Lee recently said this to a group of priesthood leaders: \u201cI say to you brethren the most dangerous thing that can happen between you and your wife or between me and my wife is apathy, \u2026 for them to feel that we are not interested in their affairs, that we are not expressing our love and showing our affection in countless ways. Women to be happy have to be loved and so do men.\u201d (Seminar for Regional Representatives of the Twelve, December 12, 1970, p. 6.)\nTo take lightly the law of chastity or to violate the moral teachings of the Savior is a sober matter. It seems incredible that priesthood holders and women who have been considered worthy to hold a recommend to the temple and be married therein are so often guilty of adultery, infidelity, and other sex sins.\nIn this day when so many women are working out of the home, as men and women work together, many homes are broken up by what at first starts to be an innocent association.\nPresident McKay gave some sober direction to the men when he said, \u201cA man who has entered into a sacred covenant in the house of the Lord to remain true to the marriage vow is a traitor to the covenant if he separates himself from his wife and family just because he has permitted himself to become infatuated with the pretty face and comely form of some young girl who flattered him with a smile. Even though a loose interpretation of the law of the land would grant such a man a bill of divorcement, I think he is unworthy of a recommend to have his second marriage performed in the temple.\u201d (Gospel Ideals, p. 473.)\nNo matter what the reason for divorce, those usually hurt most are the children. Too often the children are robbed of the basic needs to prepare them for life.\nPresident McKay said there are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled: (1) a respected name, (2) a sense of security, (3) opportunities for development. (The LDS Family, p. 406.) The possibility of any of these is lessened in divorce.\nAs Sister Cullimore and I went to the temple to be married, President George H. Brimhall [of Brigham Young University] called us into his office. He gave us some direction we have appreciated through the years. He said: \u201cThe four fountains that will keep your \u2018Garden of Eden\u2019 from becoming a desert are constant confidence, constant counsel, constant compromise, constant courtship.\u201d\nImportant to any marriage is complete confidence\u2014trust in all things. The confidence born of true love, never doubting, never questioning the integrity of each other. Someone has said: \u201cSociety is built upon trust, and trust upon confidence in one another\u2019s integrity.\u201d\nTo counsel with each other and make decisions together is so important to a happy marriage. Counsel which includes the whole family might build good family relationships.\nCounseling with each other in all that is done will strengthen the bonds of marriage.\nI suppose there is no surer need in marriage than constant compromise. It is through compromise that we grow closer to each other. As we acknowledge our own faults and recognize the virtues in the other and make the adjustments, we strengthen our marriage.\nHenry Watterson has said: \u201cI would compromise war. I would compromise glory. I would compromise everything at that point where hate comes in, where misery comes in, where love ceases to be love, and life begins its descent into the valley of the shadow of death. But I would not compromise Truth. I would not compromise the right.\u201d\nConstant courtship. President McKay has said: \u201cThe seeds of a happy married life are sown in youth. Happiness does not begin at the altar: it begins during the period of youth and courtship.\u201d (Pathways to Happiness [Bookcraft, 1957], p. 49.)\nNeither should courtship end at the altar. How important it is to constantly be conscious of our marriage and work at it every day we live, keeping alive our courtship by kind acts, thoughtfulness, and consideration always. Archibald F. Bennett, in his writings on family exaltation, expresses this beautifully: \u201cToo many couples have come to the altar of marriage looking upon the marriage ceremony as the end of courtship instead of the beginning of an eternal courtship. Let us not forget that during the burdens of home life \u2026 that tender words of appreciation, courteous acts are even more appreciated than during those sweet days and months of courtship. It is after the ceremony and during the trials that daily arise in the home, that a word of \u2018thank you,\u2019 or \u2018pardon me,\u2019 \u2018if you please,\u2019 \u2026 will contribute to that love which brought you to the altar. \u2026 The wedding ring gives no man the right to be cruel or inconsiderate, and no woman the right to be slovenly, cross or disagreeable.\u201d (The LDS Family, p. 236.)\nMay we keep sacred our marriage vows and live so that we might enjoy its eternal blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nJames A. Cullimore\nMarriage Is Intended to Be Forever\n1971\nTuesday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brethren of the priesthood, it is very humbling to feel the great strength gathered here and in the many buildings across the world. As we gather tonight, we praise the name of President Howard W. Hunter for his life and his ministry, and for all that we have learned from him. God bless his memory.\nBrethren, I confess to you that I am not very comfortable in the calling I have received. I earnestly desire, with all humility, your faith and prayers. If I did not have the absolute conviction that \u201ca man must be called of God\u201d1 to any office in the Church, I could not serve for one hour in this calling. I express my profound appreciation to President Gordon B. Hinckley for the honor and the trust he has shown to me in calling me to be his second counselor. He has my total loyalty and support.\nAs I expressed in the press conference on Monday, March 13, 1995, I have had the great privilege of associating in various Church assignments with President Gordon B. Hinckley for forty years. I know his heart. I know his soul. I know of his faith. I know of his dedication. I know of his great capacity. I know of his love of the Lord and God\u2019s holy work. I have a great personal affection and regard for him. I also know that he has been foreordained and marvelously prepared to be the President of this church in our day and time.\nMy association with President Thomas S. Monson has also been long and blessed. We have worked closely together for decades in several capacities. His mind and memory are unique; his faith simple and absolute. President Monson is a big man, but the biggest part of him is his great heart. He has tremendous talent. I feel very humbled to serve with President Hinckley and President Monson. I have profound respect and admiration for President Packer, each member of the Twelve, and all of the General Authorities. And I welcome Brother Eyring into the choice fellowship of the sacred apostleship.\nTonight I would like to speak to the priesthood of God in their capacity as the Lord\u2019s shepherds. Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated: \u201cAnyone serving in any capacity in the Church in which he is responsible for the spiritual or temporal well-being of any of the Lord\u2019s children is a shepherd to those sheep. The Lord holds his shepherds accountable for the safety [meaning the salvation] of his sheep.\u201d2 The bearers of the priesthood have this great responsibility, whether it is father, grandfather, home teacher, elders quorum president, bishop, stake president, or other Church calling.\nInitially, I speak to the worthy young men of the Aaronic Priesthood. When I was a very small boy, my father found a lamb all alone out in the desert. The herd of sheep to which its mother belonged had moved on, and somehow the lamb got separated from its mother, and the shepherd must not have known that it was lost. Because it could not survive alone in the desert, my father picked it up and brought it home. To have left the lamb there would have meant certain death, either by falling prey to the coyotes or by starvation because it was so young that it still needed milk. Some sheepmen call these lambs \u201cbummers.\u201d My father gave the lamb to me and I became its shepherd.\nFor several weeks I warmed cow\u2019s milk in a baby\u2019s bottle and fed the lamb. We became fast friends. I called him Nigh\u2014why I don\u2019t remember. It began to grow. My lamb and I would play on the lawn. Sometimes we would lie together on the grass and I would lay my head on its soft, woolly side and look up at the blue sky and the white billowing clouds. I did not lock my lamb up during the day. It would not run away. It soon learned to eat grass. I could call my lamb from anywhere in the yard by just imitating as best I could the bleating sound of a sheep: Baa. Baa.\nOne night there came a terrible storm. I forgot to put my lamb in the barn that night as I should have done. I went to bed. My little friend was frightened in the storm, and I could hear it bleating. I knew that I should help my pet, but I wanted to stay safe, warm, and dry in my bed. I didn\u2019t get up as I should have done. The next morning I went out to find my lamb dead. A dog had also heard its bleating cry and killed it. My heart was broken. I had not been a good shepherd or steward of that which my father had entrusted to me. My father said, \u201cSon, couldn\u2019t I trust you to take care of just one lamb?\u201d My father\u2019s remark hurt me more than losing my woolly friend. I resolved that day, as a little boy, that I would try never again to neglect my stewardship as a shepherd if I were ever placed in that position again.\nNot too many years thereafter I was called as a junior companion to a home teacher. There were times when it was so cold or stormy and I wanted to stay home and be comfortable, but in my mind\u2019s ear I could hear my little lamb bleating, and I knew I needed to be a good shepherd and go with my senior companion. In all those many years, whenever I have had a desire to shirk my duties, there would come to me a remembrance of how sorry I was that night so many years ago when I had not been a good shepherd. I have not always done everything I should have, but I have tried.\nI should like to speak for a few minutes about the constitutional duties of the Lord\u2019s shepherds. By that I mean those responsibilities which are contained in the revelations given by the Lord himself. There is no greater responsibility than that of being a husband and a father, from which there is no release. The Lord said, \u201cThou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.\u201d3 The Lord further says to the fathers of this church, \u201cI have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.\u201d4\n\u201cAnd they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.\n\u201cAnd the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\u201d5\nAnother great responsibility is that of the home teacher. \u201cThe teacher\u2019s duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;\n\u201cAnd see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking.\u201d6 A further commandment is to \u201csee that the church meet together often, and also see that all the members do their duty.\u201d7 They are to \u201cwarn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ.\u201d8\nThe priesthood quorum presidents and their counselors are also shepherds of the sheepfold and bear the responsibility to lovingly care for the members of their quorums. The bishops of the Church are some of the watchmen on the tower. Said Paul to Timothy regarding the bishops of the Church:\n\u201cThis is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\n\u201cA bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;\n\u201cNot given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;\n\u201cOne that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;\n\u201c(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)\u201d9\nOf the Aaronic Priesthood, the Lord has said, \u201cThe bishopric is the presidency of this priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same.\u201d10 Bishops, our young men are experiencing the storms of life. There are vicious wolves prowling to devour them. Many of them are like my little lamb, crying out for help. We plead with you bishops to do all you can to keep them safe.\nThe stake president is also a constitutional officer of the Church, for he presides over the stake which the Lord has said \u201cmay be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.\u201d11 The stakes are \u201cthe curtains or the strength of Zion.\u201d12 They are to be spiritual centers of righteousness, strength, and protection.\nThe Presiding Bishopric, each of whom is an ordained bishop, have the responsibility for directing the temporal affairs of the Church as assigned by the First Presidency. In this great worldwide Church the responsibility of the Presiding Bishopric is heavy and great.\nThe Lord said of the Seventy:\n\u201cThe Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world\u2014thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling. \u2026\n\u201cThe Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews.\u201d13\nThe Twelve Apostles are the \u201cspecial witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world, thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.\u201d14 The Lord said they are \u201cbeing sent out, holding the keys, to open the door by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d15 The Twelve are the legates of the Lord.\nThe First Presidency have the ultimate responsibility for the affairs of the kingdom of God on the earth. Of them the Lord has said:\n\u201cOf the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church. \u2026\n\u201cAnd the Presidency of the council of the High Priesthood shall have power to call other high priests, even twelve, to assist as counselors; and thus the Presidency of the High Priesthood and its counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony according to the laws of the church.\u201d16\nOf the President of the Church, the Lord has said that he is the \u201cPresident of the High Priesthood of the Church;\n\u201cOr, in other words, the Presiding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church.\u201d17 He is \u201cto preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses\u2014 \u2026 to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.\u201d18\nThe President of the Church directs the use of all of the keys and authority of the priesthood and is the only person who can exercise all of them, even though all of the ordained Apostles hold these keys, some of which are in latent form.\nBrethren, I have been a member of the First Presidency for only a few days. It seems as though before I had this calling I had limited vision, but I have now put on glasses that allow me to see more clearly, in a small way, the magnitude of the responsibility of the President of the Church. I am afraid I am like the aristocrat who wore a monocle in one eye. Of him it was said, \u201cHe could see more than he could comprehend.\u201d The men who see most clearly the big picture are these giants of the Lord, President Hinckley and President Monson, who have served many years faithfully as counselors to the previous Presidents of the Church.\nNow brethren, in conclusion, in a church as vast and far-reaching as ours, there must be order. We must have, in addition to the scriptures and modern revelations, guidelines and procedures for the Church to move forward around the world in an orderly manner. There are some elements of bureaucracy which cannot help but occasionally produce some irritation and perhaps frustration. We ask you to look beyond any irritations or inconvenience in Church administration. We ask you to focus and concentrate on the simple, sublime, spiritually nourishing, and saving principles of the gospel. We ask you to stand steady. We ask you to be faithful in your stewardships as the shepherding priesthood authority of the Church. Let us be true to our callings and the holy priesthood we bear. Let us be united in supporting and sustaining those in authority over us.\nBrethren, after more than sixty years, I can still hear in my mind the bleating, frightened cry of the lamb of my boyhood that I did not shepherd as I should have. I can also remember the loving rebuke of my father: \u201cSon, couldn\u2019t I trust you to take care of just one lamb?\u201d If we are not good shepherds, I wonder how we will feel in the eternities.\n\u201cJesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\n\u201cHe saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\n\u201cHe saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\u201d19\nThat we may do so, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJames E. Faust\nResponsibilities of Shepherds\n1995\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Frequently we sing the hymn, \u201cCome, listen to a prophet\u2019s voice and hear the word of God.\u201d (Hymns, no. 46.) Today we have listened to the voice of a prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, proclaim the word of God.\nHumbly and prayerfully I seek Divine help as I speak to you from the crossroads of the West. Salt Lake City is a mecca for tourists from all parts of the globe. Thousands throng to the beautiful ski slopes of Alta, Brighton, Park City, and Snowbird each winter. Each summer the canyons of Bryce and Zion\u2019s host thousands more. An attraction for all seasons is Temple Square, with its historic Tabernacle, lofty, spired temple, and the beautiful Visitors Center which bids to one and all a friendly welcome.\nSituated somewhat off the beaten path, away from the crowd, is yet another famous square. Here in a quiet fashion, motivated by a Christlike love, elderly and handicapped workers serve one another after the divine plan of the Master. I speak of Welfare Square, sometimes known as the Bishops Storehouse. At this central location and at numerous other sites throughout the world, fruits and vegetables are canned, commodities processed, labeled, stored, and distributed to those persons who are in need. There is no sign of government dole nor the exchange of currency here, since only the signed order from an ordained bishop is honored.\nJournalists marvel at this unique welfare plan and write glowingly of a people who take justifiable pride in the independence of caring for their own. Most frequently the curious and pleasantly surprised visitor asks three fundamental questions: (1) How does this plan operate? (2) How is it financed? (3) What prompts such devotion on the part of every worker?\nOver the years it has been my pleasant opportunity to supply many with the answers to these sincerely asked questions. To the question \u201cHow does this plan operate?\u201d I usually respond by mentioning that I had the privilege during the period 1950 through 1955 to preside as a bishop over 1,000 members, situated in the central part of Salt Lake City. In the congregation were eighty-six widows and perhaps forty families who were judged to be in need, at varying times and to some extent, of welfare assistance. Each year, I, along with the thousands of other bishops, would prepare a commodity requirement budget estimating the needs of our people for the coming year. All such budgets were carefully reviewed and compiled and specific assignments given to units of the Church, that the requirements of the needy might be met.\nIn one ecclesiastical unit the Church members would produce beef, in another oranges, in another vegetables or wheat\u2014even a variety of staples, that the storehouses might be filled and the elderly and needy supplied. The Lord provided the way when he declared, \u201cAnd the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor.\u201d (D&C 83:6.) Then the reminder, \u201cBut it must needs be done in mine own way.\u201d (D&C 104:16.)\nIn the vicinity where I lived and served, we operated a poultry project. Most of the time it was an efficiently operated project supplying to the storehouse thousands of dozens of fresh eggs and hundreds of pounds of dressed poultry. On a few occasions, however, the experience of being volunteer city farmers provided not only blisters on the hands, but frustration of heart and mind. For instance, I shall ever remember the time we gathered together the teenaged Aaronic Priesthood young men to really give the poultry project a spring cleaning treatment. Our enthusiastic and energetic throng gathered at the project, and in a speedy fashion uprooted, gathered, and burned large quantities of weeds and debris. By the light of the glowing bonfires we ate hot dogs and congratulated ourselves on a job well done. The project was now neat and tidy. However, there was just one disastrous problem. The noise and the fires had so disturbed the fragile and temperamental population of 5,000 laying hens that most of them went into a sudden moult and ceased laying. Thereafter we tolerated a few weeds, that we might produce more eggs.\nNo member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who has canned peas, topped beets, hauled hay, or shoveled coal in such a cause ever forgets or regrets the experience of helping provide for those in need. Devoted men and women help to operate this vast and inspired program. In reality, the plan would never succeed on effort alone, for this program operates through faith after the way of the Lord.\nSharing with others that which we have is not new to our generation. We need but to turn to the account found in First Kings of the Holy Bible to appreciate anew the principle that when we follow the counsel of the Lord, when we care for those in need, the outcome benefits all. There we read that a most severe drought had gripped the land. Famine followed. Elijah the prophet received from the Lord what to him must have been an amazing instruction: \u201cGet thee to Zarephath: \u2026 behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.\u201d When he had found the widow, Elijah declared, \u201cFetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\n\u201cAnd as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\u201d\nHer response described her pathetic situation as she explained that she was preparing a final and scanty meal for her son and for herself, and then they would die.\nHow implausible to her must have been Elijah\u2019s response: \u201cFear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.\n\u201cFor thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.\n\u201cAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.\n\u201cAnd the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail.\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:9\u201311, 13\u201316.) This is the faith that has ever motivated and inspired the welfare plan of the Lord.\nIn response to the second question, \u201cHow is your welfare plan financed?\u201d one needs but to describe the fast offering principle. The prophet Isaiah described the true fast by asking, \u201cIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\n\u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.\n\u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. \u2026\n\u201cAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought: \u2026 and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d (Isa. 58:7\u20139, 11.)\nGuided by this principle, in a plan outlined and taught by inspired prophets of God, Latter-day Saints fast one day each month and contribute generously to a fast offering fund at least the equivalent of the meals forfeited and usually many times more. Such sacred offerings finance the operation of storehouses, supply cash needs of the poor, and provide medical care for the sick who are without funds.\nIn many areas, the offerings are collected each month by the boys who are deacons as they visit each member\u2019s home generally quite early on the Sabbath day. I recall that the boys in the congregation over which I presided had assembled one morning, sleepy-eyed, a bit disheveled, and mildly complaining about arising so early to fulfill their assignment. Not a word of reproof was spoken, but during the following week, we escorted the boys to Welfare Square for a guided tour. They saw firsthand a lame person operating the telephone switchboard, an older man stocking shelves, women arranging clothing to be distributed\u2014even a blind person placing labels on cans. Here were individuals earning their sustenance through their contributed labors. A penetrating silence came over the boys as they witnessed how their efforts each month helped to collect the sacred fast offering funds which aided the needy and provided employment for those who otherwise would be idle.\nFrom that hallowed day forward, there was no urging required by our deacons. On fast Sunday mornings they were present at 7:00, dressed in their Sunday best, anxious to do their duty as holders of the Aaronic Priesthood. No longer were they simply distributing and collecting envelopes. They were helping to provide food for the hungry and shelter for the homeless\u2014all after the way of the Lord. Their smiles were more frequent, their pace more eager, their very souls more subdued. Perhaps now they were marching to the beat of a different drummer; perhaps now they better understood the classic passage, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (Matt. 25:40.)\nTo the third and final question, \u201cWhat prompts such devotion on the part of every worker?\u201d the answer can be stated simply: An individual testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, even a heartfelt desire to love the Lord with all one\u2019s heart, mind, and soul, and one\u2019s neighbor as oneself.\nThis is what motivated a personal friend, now deceased, who was in the produce business, to telephone me during those days as a bishop and say, \u201cI\u2019m sending to the storehouse a semi-truck and trailer filled with citrus fruits for those who would otherwise go without. Let the storehouse management know the truck is coming, and there will be no charge; but Bishop, no one is to know who sent it.\u201d Rarely have I seen the joy and appreciation this generous act brought forth. Never have I questioned the eternal reward to which that unnamed benefactor has now gone.\nSuch kind deeds of generosity are not a rarity, but are frequently found. Situated beneath the heavily traveled freeway which girds Salt Lake City is the home of a sixty-year-old single man who has, due to a crippling disease, never known a day without pain nor many days without loneliness. One winter\u2019s day as I visited him, he was slow in answering the doorbell\u2019s ring. I entered his well-kept home; the temperature in save but one room, the kitchen, was a chilly 40 degrees. The reason: not sufficient money to heat any other room. The walls needed papering, the ceilings to be lowered, the cupboards filled.\nTroubled by the experience of visiting my friend, a bishop was consulted and a miracle of love, prompted by testimony, took place. The ward members were organized and the labor of love begun. A month later, my friend Lou called and asked if I would come and see what had happened to him. I did, and indeed beheld a miracle. The sidewalks which had been uprooted by large poplar trees had been replaced, the porch of the home rebuilt, a new door with glistening hardware installed, the ceilings lowered, the walls papered, the woodwork painted, the roof replaced, and the cupboards filled. No longer was the home chilly and uninviting. It now seemed to whisper a warm welcome. Lou saved until last showing me his pride and joy: there on his bed was a beautiful plaid quilt bearing the crest of his McDonald family clan. It had been made with loving care by the women of the Relief Society. Before leaving, I discovered that each week the Young Adults would bring in a hot dinner and share a home evening. Warmth had replaced the cold; repairs had transformed the wear of years; but more significantly, hope had dispelled despair and now love reigned triumphant.\nAll who participated in this moving drama of real life had discovered a new and personal appreciation of the Master\u2019s teaching, \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d (Acts 20:35.)\nTo all within the sound of my voice I declare that the welfare plan of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is inspired of Almighty God. Indeed, the Lord Jesus Christ is its Architect. To you I extend a heartfelt and sincere invitation: Come to Salt Lake City and visit Welfare Square. Your eyes will glow a little brighter, your heart will beat a little faster, and life itself will acquire a new depth of meaning. May such be your experience, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nThe Way of the Lord\n1977\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I wonder if you have any idea how easy you are to love and how much I love you. Just before this session started, some of our grandchildren stopped by our hotel room. They had obviously been talking about Elder Marlin Jensen\u2019s talk of this morning. One of them said, \u201cAre you scared, Grandpa?\u201d I lied and said, \u201cNot very.\u201d Another one said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Grandpa, if you mess up, we\u2019ll still love you.\u201d But then reality came back into the room when someone added, \u201cBut, Grandpa, it would be very embarrassing.\u201d So I am going to try very hard not to mess up.\nOn June 26, 1858, what I believe to be the largest standing army in the history of the United States up to that date began its prearranged entry into Salt Lake Valley. They had come to quell a nonexistent rebellion. Almost anyone remotely familiar with the history of the Church can tell you that they marched in relative silence within a few yards of where this building now stands, through a city described by one writer as \u201cdeserted,\u201d and encamped some distance to the west. What followed is far less well known. In due course the army moved approximately 40 miles south of Salt Lake City to the village of Fairfield, a small farming community in Cedar Valley, home to what is estimated to have been less than 200 people. Their local spiritual leader was John Carson, my great-grandfather.\nImagine how this small congregation must have felt. After all, how would you like to wake up some morning and find that several thousand soldiers, together with over 3,000 wagons, 10,000 oxen, and 12,000 mules, had moved into your ward? The challenges were immediate. From our oral family history, and subject to all of the romanticizing and inaccuracies of such histories, we learn that Bishop Carson was gravely concerned about the welfare of the people over whom he presided. All of the challenges that attended army encampments of that time descended upon Fairfield almost overnight.\nTo protect the members of the congregation as much as possible, Bishop Carson met with the commander of the fort, who often dined at his hotel and with whom he developed a good relationship based upon mutual respect. The two leaders surveyed the situation and then by agreement drew a line upon the ground. No army personnel would cross into the civilian community without specific approval of their superiors. And members of the congregation would not cross into the fort without specific approval from Bishop Carson. The line on the ground represented an unspoken command: \u201cOver this line you may not cross.\u201d\nWhen we were children, a line on the ground had special significance. Whenever boyhood tempers caused disagreement, the time-honored solution called for a line on the ground. The antagonists stood on opposite sides of the line, attempting to act as intimidating as possible. Someone would say, \u201cStep over the line and you\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d though they usually didn\u2019t say it in those genteel words. In those moments I learned the great value of a line on the ground and the consequences of stepping over it. In the years that have followed, I have come to understand that figurative lines on the ground are placed there by a loving Heavenly Father who seeks to protect us from Lucifer\u2019s army.\nWhile each of us may have dozens of lines on the ground in our life today, I would like to discuss just one of them\u2014the line that says, \u201cKeep each person\u2019s name safe in your home.\u201d\nDuring the early years of my service as a General Authority, I was privileged to be in company with Elder Marion D. Hanks on one occasion when he related the following story. I use it here with his permission:\nOscar Kirkham was one of the great men of the Church and among the Church\u2019s most respected Scouters. He served in the First Council of the Seventy and was a significant presence wherever he went. Often in meetings he would rise to a \u201cpoint of personal privilege\u201d and then, when recognized, would proceed to say something good about someone. Near the end of his life, he spoke briefly at Brigham Young University on the theme \u201csay the good word.\u201d On the morning that Elder Kirkham died, Elder Hanks was invited to the Kirkham family home. There he was handed a small, inexpensive notebook in which Elder Kirkham had kept his notes. The last two entries were: \u201cSay the good word\u201d and \u201cYour name is safe in our home\u201d (see Marion D. Hanks, foreword to Say the Good Word, by Oscar A. Kirkham [1958], 4).\nWhat a blessing it would be if all of us could follow that counsel, if each of our names truly could be safe in the home of others. Have you noticed how easy it is to cross over the line and find fault with other people? All too often we seek to be excused from the very behavior we condemn in others. Mercy for me, justice for everyone else is a much too common addiction. When we deal with the name and reputation of another, we deal with something sacred in the sight of the Lord.\nThere are those among us who would recoil in horror at the thought of stealing another person\u2019s money or property but who don\u2019t give a second thought to stealing another person\u2019s good name or reputation.\nThe old adage \u201cNever judge another man until you have walked a mile in his footsteps\u201d is as good advice today as it was the day it was first uttered. Someone once said,\nThere is so much good in the worst of us,\nAnd so much bad in the best of us,\nThat it ill behooves any of us\nTo find fault with the rest of us.\nThe principle is not new, nor is it unique to our day and time. The book of Psalms from the Old Testament contains this urgent warning from the Lord: \u201cWhoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off\u201d (Ps. 101:5).\nJames, a servant of the Lord in the meridian of time, repeated this eternal truth when he said: \u201cSpeak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 Who art thou that judgest another?\u201d (James 4:11\u201312).\nAnd in this latter day, the Lord renewed His long-taught command in a revelation given through the prophet Brigham Young: \u201cCease to speak evil one of another\u201d (D&C 136:23).\nIt is most significant to me that this simple commandment is set forth just a few verses from the Lord\u2019s words on the penalty for disobedience: \u201cBe diligent in keeping all my commandments, lest judgments come upon you, and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you\u201d (D&C 136:42).\nTo those who doubt the importance of the commandment, may I pose two simple questions: (1) How can you say you love your fellowman when behind his back you seek to diminish his good name and reputation? (2) How can you say you love your God when you cannot even love your neighbor?\nAny feeble attempt to justify such conduct only brings more forcibly to mind those explosive words of the Savior found in the book of Matthew:\n\u201cO generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? \u2026\n\u201cBut I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n\u201cFor by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\u201d (Matt. 12:34, 36\u201337).\nI would like to say a few words to the Primary children who may be listening. Children, I\u2019ve been trying to teach your moms and dads something very important, but I need your help. I\u2019ll make you a deal. If you will promise to listen very carefully, I promise not to talk very long.\nDo you remember the story of Bambi, the little deer, and all of his friends in the forest? If you do, you will remember that one of Bambi\u2019s good friends was a rabbit named Thumper. Thumper was about your age. He was a neat rabbit, but he had one problem. He kept saying bad things about people. One day Bambi was in the forest learning to walk, and he fell down. Thumper just couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t walk very good, does he?\u201d Thumper blurted out. His mother felt very bad and said, \u201cWhat did your father tell you this morning?\u201d And then Thumper, looking down at his feet and kind of shifting his weight, said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say somethin\u2019 nice, don\u2019t say nothin\u2019 at all.\u201d That\u2019s a good piece of advice that all of us need to follow. What I need you to do, young people, is this. If you hear anyone in your family start to say something bad about someone else, will you please just stamp your foot and say in a loud voice, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say somethin\u2019 nice, don\u2019t say nothin\u2019 at all.\u201d Now, even though that isn\u2019t correct English, everyone will understand exactly what you mean. Now, Moms and Dads, that ought to make it a little easier to live the commandment.\nI pray that the Lord will bless each of us that we may never cross over the line on the ground and that we may live so that it can be said, \u201cYour name is safe in our home.\u201d\nOn this special Easter Day, I close with my solemn declaration, born of the Spirit, that Jesus Christ is indeed our Savior and our Redeemer and that salvation comes by and through His atoning sacrifice and in no other way. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElder Cree-L Kofford\nYour Name Is Safe in Our Home\n1999\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I was raised by caring parents in a home where the values taught and practiced prepared the way for my introduction to the Church and an acceptance of gospel principles. I was baptized in the month of August 1959, shortly after my 19th birthday. As I ponder the events that preceded my conversion, my thoughts go back to a childhood experience.\nClose to the home where I lived as a child was a large house. It was located on beautiful grounds enclosed by what was to me a towering fence made of wood paneling, probably six feet in height. I recall peeping through holes in the panels where knots of wood had dropped out. It was like looking through a telescope into a different world. The beautifully manicured lawns, the well-kept flower gardens, and a small orchard provided an idyllic setting for the distinctive dwelling. Unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy the view was always brief due to the vigilant British bulldog that patrolled the gardens and was immediately attracted to anyone standing close to the exterior of the fencing. Even though the fierce dog was confined in the garden, the sound of his sniffing as he approached the fence caused me to retreat in fear as my vivid imagination conjured up a variety of possibilities.\nMr. and Mrs. Lyons, who lived in the home, were schoolteachers. They had a dignified demeanor and seemed to enjoy the privacy that the house setting afforded them. To add to the intrigue, Mr. Lyons had no right hand, using instead a steel hook that protruded below the cuff of his jacket. In my boyish mind, I could imagine Mr. Lyons pursuing me, catching me by the collar with the hook, and taking me captive.\nI recall an August morning when I was 10 or 11 years old, following a night of unusually strong winds, being greeted by friends as I left my home. They were obviously excited by something and inquired, \u201cDid you hear the wind last night?\u201d\nWhen I said that I had, they proceeded to tell me what they had discovered\u2014the wind had blown down sections of the fencing surrounding the Lyonses\u2019 home. I could not understand why this would cause so much excitement and asked them to explain the significance.\nThey responded with even greater enthusiasm: \u201cWe have access to the apple trees!\u201d\nI was still very cautious and asked, \u201cBut what about Mr. Lyons?\u201d\n\u201cMr. and Mrs. Lyons are not at home; they are away visiting relatives.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is the dog?\u201d I probed.\n\u201cThe family has placed him in boarding kennels,\u201d came the reply.\nMy friends had certainly carried out detailed research. So, reassured by their words, we headed for our target with all haste. Entering the grounds we climbed trees and hurriedly plucked fruit, filling our pockets and also the space between our shirts and our bodies. My heart was pounding and my pulse racing since I feared that any moment the dog or Mr. Lyons, or both, would appear in the garden and apprehend us. We ran from the scene of our trespass to a secluded place in a nearby wooded area and, after regaining our composure, began to consume the apples.\nIt was August, and the apples were not yet ripe enough to eat. In fact, they had a very bitter taste, but the tartness of these green apples did not deter us as we enthusiastically consumed our spoils, acting out of a compulsion I cannot now explain. After devouring a significant number, I contented myself with taking a bite out of each remaining apple and throwing the remnants of the fruit into the nearby bushes. The frivolity diminished as our bodies began to gradually react to the invasion they had experienced. The chemical reaction between my gastric juices and the unripe apples caused me to experience stomach cramps and to feel nauseated. As I sat regretting what I had done, I realized that a feeling within me was producing even more discomfort than the unripe apples.\nThe greater discomfort resulted from the realization that what I had done was wrong.\nWhen my friends had proposed that we invade the garden, I had felt uncomfortable but lacked the courage to say no and so suppressed my feelings. Now, after the deed had been accomplished, I was filled with remorse. To my regret, I had ignored the promptings warning me of the error of my actions.\nPhysical barriers and external forces may prevent us from pursuing deviant paths, but there is also a feeling within each of us, sometimes described as a still, small voice,1 that when recognized and responded to will keep us from succumbing to temptation.\nYears later, the words of President Boyd K. Packer touched a tender chord within me when he taught, \u201cWe cannot set off on a wrong course without first overruling a warning.\u201d I thought of that moment and others like it\u2014the impressions and insights that come as we contemplate the consequences of our actions.\nThe prophet Mormon expands our view of the source of those impressions in these words: \u201cThe Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil.\u201d2\nThe proposition that we all have this gift of guidance is supported in the Gospel according to St. John, wherein it is written concerning the Savior \u201cthat [He] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\u201d3\nThese stirrings within us originate from a divine source and, when followed, will help to keep us on course, thus protecting us from harmful influences and dangerous detours.\nSeveral weeks after the experience with the apples I set out to join my friends in the wooded area close to home, anticipating that we would devise some activity or game to play. As I approached them, they were huddled together. I saw smoke rising in the air above them and recognized the aroma of burning tobacco. One of them had obtained a packet of cigarettes, and they were smoking. They invited me to join them, but I declined. They persisted, suggesting that my reluctance to participate was a sign of weakness. Their taunts turned to ridicule, combined with condescending remarks. But nothing they could say or do could persuade me to change my mind. I had not been raised with a knowledge of the restored gospel and knew nothing of the Word of Wisdom, but I was restrained by a feeling within that I should not participate with them.\nAs I walked home reflecting on the decision I had made, I felt good inside. Although my expectations for the day had not materialized and I would have to find a way to occupy my time without my friends, I had discovered something about myself\u2014about the source of real happiness and the invigoration that results from making the right decision, whatever the circumstances or outcome may be.\nRevelation received by Joseph Smith the Prophet describes the benefits associated with adhering to this inherent compass in this passage of scripture: \u201cAnd the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.\u201d4\nNot only does this verse provide a further witness that we all have access to this source of divine direction, it also emphasizes the need for us to hearken, or listen and respond, to the promptings we receive. The promise that follows is of great significance to me: \u201cAnd every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.\u201d5\nThese intimations, sometimes referred to as conscience but more accurately defined as the Light of Christ, not only help us in deciding what is right and what is wrong, they will, if followed, lead us to the source of that light which emanates from the presence of the Father and the Son.6\nThe Savior promised His disciples: \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth.\u201d7 He further describes this gift as \u201cthe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost.\u201d8 One may experience manifestations of the Holy Ghost, but the gift is conferred and can only be received by the laying on of hands following baptism.9\nI have come to more fully appreciate why it is written of His disciples on the Western Hemisphere, \u201cThey did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.\u201d10\nHe is the consummate courier of truth.\nAs I have looked back over my life, it is clear to me that many decisions\u2014some seemingly small at the time and others with which I have wrestled, recognizing their import\u2014have caused me to climb to higher planes than I would had I not yielded to the enticings of the Holy Spirit.11\nWithout this glorious gift we cannot comprehend the purpose of life or the great plan of the Eternal Father.12 For \u201cit is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him.\u201d13\nRelying on logic and exercising intellect will not suffice: \u201cNeither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and purify themselves before him.\u201d14\nI cannot find words to adequately express my feelings concerning the Light of Christ and the gift of the Holy Ghost. They are as \u201ca lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\u201d15\nConsider the petition of the Savior to the Father concerning the Twelve in the land of Bountiful, expressed in these words:\n\u201cFather, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.\n\u201cFather, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.\u201d16\nIn this turbulent, troubled world we can find assurance and enjoy peace of conscience by believing the words of the prophets and through the companionship of the Comforter. Thus we may know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world.17\nI declare my witness of these truths in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElder Kenneth Johnson\nYielding to the Enticings of the Holy Spirit\n2002\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "During this past summer, it was my great privilege to stand in a circle while my son-in-law ordained one of my grandsons to the priesthood. That was a signal honor for a grandfather, and I know Robbie couldn\u2019t have been more proud of it than I was. Since that time, I have considered very much what I would like to say to Robbie concerning this honor that has come into his life and how desirous I am as his grandfather that he live worthy of what was promised him in the blessing that his father gave him under the inspiration of the Lord. So tonight I would like to address my remarks to Robbie and to all this grand army of Aaronic Priesthood who sit here in front of me and are listening throughout the world.\nWhile serving as a mission president it was my great privilege and responsibility to interview every missionary as he began his mission. That was always a great experience, but it sometimes gave me insights into the backgrounds of my missionaries that shocked me. One elder told me of his growing up in a small farming community as the son of the town drunkard. When, as a newly called missionary, he boarded the bus to come to Salt Lake City to enter the mission home, his father was there to bid him farewell. He must have been drunk, for his last words to his son were, \u201cSon, you will never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d\nAs I talked with my missionary, I could sense that he had heard that phrase over and over again throughout his young life: \u201cYou will never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d And that choice young man, called by the Lord to be his representative, believed it. I resolved to prove that father wrong by seeing that the missionary had a successful mission. I assigned him to a great first companion and watched his progress with keen interest and daily prayers. And progress he did.\nAs my release date approached, I made a final tour of the mission to say good-bye to my beloved fellow workers. By this time the young man was a zone leader, a very important calling in the mission field. He conducted that zone conference like a veteran bishop. I saw the deep bond of love that had developed between him and his missionaries. I thought of the scores of converts who had joined the Church through his devoted service and the power of his testimony. At an appropriate moment in the conference I stood beside him with my arm around him and said, with a lump in my throat, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe this, but someone once said of this young man that he would never amount to a hill of beans.\u201d He turned and looked me in the eye and responded, \u201cWe sure showed him, didn\u2019t we, President?\u201d\nWhat had occurred to bring about such a dramatic change in that elder\u2019s life\u2014to change him from a frightened little farm boy to a man of God? He had made some interesting discoveries that had prepared him to face the challenge of life and to be armed to succeed\u2014the same discoveries every young Latter-day Saint must make as he matures if he is to achieve his potential here and hereafter. He had discovered that he really was a son of God\u2014with the capacity to become as God is, with all of his power, his might, and his majesty. He knew the truth of Christ\u2019s oath: \u201cAll that my Father hath shall be given unto him\u201d (D&C 84:38). What a discovery for a young man to make\u2014that he is a son of God!\nDoesn\u2019t that make you feel kind of special to know how much God is counting on you? The future of his Church is in your hands. You are the ones that God has chosen to be his leaders, reserved to come to this earth when you could influence your fellowmen by the power of your lives and by sharing the principles of the gospel. How well are you doing, young men?\nOne of our fine young men, living in the eastern part of this country where he was one of few Latter-day Saints in his high school, received his mission call. As he prepared for his mission he asked his parents\u2019 permission to invite twenty-five of his nonmember friends to come to the home for a farewell party. During that party the young missionary showed his friends Man\u2019s Search for Happiness, explained why he was going on a mission for his church, and bore his testimony to them. They all in turn hugged him and let him know they loved him and sustained him.\nMy missionary had also discovered that, despite his weaknesses, his frailties, and his youth, he had a tremendous untapped capacity to serve his fellowmen and to influence them for good, even to being an instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands to change and save lives.\nAt a youth conference I met five young men. One of them, who had recently fallen into inactivity, had been persuaded to attend the conference by some strong-arm tactics of his friends, who would not let him fall away from the Church. Touched by the spirit of that youth conference and the love of his buddies, that inactive boy joined his four friends in pledging to one another that they would live righteous lives. Today he is serving a mission for the Lord, thankful for those companions who cared so much about him.\nIt is an interesting phenomenon, my young friends, how, as we serve, our capacity to serve grows and our opportunities for service expand. And we learn the great secret to a happy, rewarding life\u2014that happiness, real happiness, doesn\u2019t come in acquiring wealth or gaining notoriety or position. True, lasting happiness comes in service.\nMy missionary had learned something about the magnificent power of the holy priesthood, which lifted him beyond his own natural capacity. That knowledge had come as he exercised it in the service of others, blessing them as the Lord\u2019s representative.\nYou Aaronic Priesthood holders have that holy power as you prepare for the great spiritual gifts that come with the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood, for you have been given the right to the ministering of angels (see D&C 84:33\u201339). The Lord has promised you: \u201cI will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up (see D&C 84:88)\u2014even on the football field, in the classrooms, in your studies, in your work, at play\u2014in all you do.\nWhile visiting a sacrament meeting on Okinawa, I was so impressed with the manner in which the Aaronic Priesthood prepared and passed the sacrament that, when my turn came to speak, I invited two of the deacons to join me at the pulpit. Of one I asked, \u201cWhat are your goals in life?\u201d His prompt reply: \u201cTo become like my Savior!\u201d Of the other I asked, \u201cWhat does it mean to you to know that you hold the Aaronic priesthood?\u201d He drew himself to his full height and looked out over that pulpit, and proudly said, \u201cIt is the greatest honor in my life!\u201d\nAre you honoring that sacred calling and responding in that sacred service as did my Japanese brethren? One deacon was asked what he did. He replied, \u201cI do what I am supposed to do.\u201d\nMy beloved young brethren, God has singled you out from among all his sons to assist him in this great latter-day work. He trusts you and he has confidence in your meeting the mighty challenge to truly represent him. He is schooling you for your important missions and he expects you to recognize that you are different from other boys and young men\u2014not better, but different\u2014because you have been blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood of God. Because he has given you so much, he expects you to live beyond your friends and associates who do not have the light of the gospel\u2014he expects you to be in the world but not of the world. He promises you the strength to resist temptation and Satan\u2019s power if you will cling to the iron rod of the gospel and honor your sacred calling.\nWhat is it that deters us from being that faithful priesthood holder God desires?\nThe trouble with some of us is we get caught in monkey traps. In Africa, the natives have a unique, effective way to capture monkeys. They lop the top off a coconut, remove the meat, and leave a hole in the top of the coconut large enough for the monkey to put his paw in. Then they anchor the coconut to the ground with some peanuts in it. When the natives leave, the monkeys, smelling those delicious peanuts, approach the coconuts, see the peanuts in them, put their paws in to grasp the nuts, and attempt to remove the nuts\u2014but find that the hole is too small for their doubled-up fists. The natives return with gunny sacks and pick up the monkeys\u2014clawing, biting, screaming\u2014but they won\u2019t drop the peanuts to save their lives.\nDo you know anyone who is caught in a monkey trap, where the things that matter the most are at the mercy of those things that matter the least?\nI\u2019d like you to ponder that, my young brethren; then make certain you are not caught in like fashion by the siren songs of our society, by the mocking, the daring of so-called friends, or those insidious evils Satan will place in your path in attractive packages which turn out to be empty and hollow. Develop the courage to stand for what you believe, to be true to the faith.\nA spiritual young black joined the Church in West Virginia recently. Excited about the newfound truth that had come into his life, he sought eagerly to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with his fellow high-school students. Their response was that the gospel was too strict. How proud we can be of his reply to them: \u201cWhat\u2019s strict about following the true Church of Christ?\u201d\nIn my lifetime, my young friends, I have discovered that happiness comes in keeping the commandments of God. Alma learned the hard way that \u201cwickedness never was happiness\u201d (Alma 41:10). Believe his words. Lean on the experience and the faith of men and women you trust as you chart your course in life. If you will diligently search for truth and live those beautiful principles, your life will be full, rich, rewarding\u2014and exciting. Our Father in Heaven needs strong men to build his kingdom, and as I look at you, I know you are the best he\u2019s got.\nWe sing, \u201cHope of Israel, Zion\u2019s army, Children of the promised day\u201d (Hymns, no. 64). Did you realize that song was written about you? President Kimball has reminded us of that. He said, \u201cWe are rearing a royal generation \u2026 who have special things to do\u201d (Ensign, May 1976, p. 45).\nThose special things you have to do include being rulers of the nations, lawmakers, business and professional men, teachers, tradesmen, tillers of the soil, and so on. But even more, the special things you have to do involve the establishment of the kingdom of Zion and the building of it. That, my young brethren, requires much more than the casual approach many of us take to preparation for life. It requires the establishment of goals\u2014far-reaching goals that stretch into eternity, goals that require courage and determination to achieve.\nHow many of you have thought of what you\u2019re going to be doing five years, ten years, or twenty-five years from now? And what preparation are you making to make certain that you are in control and not victimized by life? Nothing stands in the way of a boy who knows where he is going.\nIf I were in your shoes I would set some important goals for myself right now.\nThe first would be, \u201cI am going on a mission!\u201d\nWe sit here at the feet of President Kimball who has stated that every young man should serve a mission. Do you sustain him as a prophet? If you do, your only response should be, \u201cWhen? I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d That mission experience will be one of the most important events in your entire life, just as it was for my missionary who wasn\u2019t going to amount to a hill of beans.\nSecond: \u201cI am going to be married in the house of the Lord!\u201d\nIf you would only realize how vitally important that is to your eternal goals, you wouldn\u2019t consider being married anyplace else; and that would affect who you date and how you date and would influence the entire fabric of your moral and spiritual life.\nThird: \u201cI am always going to be active in God\u2019s Church!\u201d\nThat will provide an anchor for you like nothing else on earth, for it will give you the opportunity to discover for yourself the real meaning of happiness. It will assure you that, no matter where you go, you belong\u2014for you have brothers and sisters who love you and sustain you. You will know something of the brotherhood of the gospel of Jesus Christ: you will become acquainted with him as your Savior; and you will keep your testimony burning brightly.\nConsider what such goals will do for you. When temptations come, as they surely will, you are going to be prepared. You will have made the choice in advance: \u201cI am going on a mission!\u201d \u201cI am going to be married in the temple!\u201d \u201cI am always going to be active in God\u2019s Church!\u201d \u201cTherefore, I will not partake!\u201d When you make those basic decisions in advance, think how many other decisions are already made: living the Word of Wisdom, keeping morally clean, attending your meetings, paying tithing, studying the gospel, and so forth. You will not compromise on any important principle. You will be in control of your life, and you will enjoy the peace and serenity that come with keeping the commandments of God.\nHow I pray that our Father in Heaven will bless you choice young men to understand that you are sons of God with unique, important roles to play in life and heavy responsibilities to your fellowmen; that he will bless you with wisdom, courage, patience, understanding, love for your brothers and sisters, and deep faith in the Lord and his gospel; and that he will keep you clean and wholesome and strong in the face of temptations and evil.\nAnd may you realize that this is your world, a beautiful world with unlimited opportunities to grow, to learn, and to serve. Will you make it a better world through the preparations you make now and the noble service you render throughout your life as a token of the love you have for your Father in Heaven and his Son, bearing witness of the truth of the gospel through your powerful example and the precepts you teach your fellowmen. \u201cHope of Israel, rise in might,\u201d and be that army that God can use to further his great purpose, I pray, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen.\nRobert L. Backman\nTo the Young Men of the Church\n1980\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "My brothers and sisters, I believe in Christ, and I stand to be accountable for that testimony. I ask the Lord\u2019s blessings this day for the sustaining support of my Brethren and for His support in Spirit.\nIn the gospel of Jesus Christ, there comes a point in time when we must stand accountable for who we are and what we are going to be. In the atonement of Jesus Christ, we have been given an example to follow\u2014that of the eldest son of God the Father. I would like to talk for just a few minutes today about the atoning sacrifice and what it has meant in my life, from the perspective of a bishop, in helping us endure to the end.\nI\u2019d like first to start in the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon where we are given a very clear lesson as we read about the brother of Jared going before the Lord. Many times when we pray, we merely restate our problems; and this was the case with the brother of Jared. As you may recall, he was directed to take his people across the waters. He had built his barges, but there was no light, there was no air, there was no visible means of propulsion or navigation. And so he went to the Lord and asked, \u201cBehold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?\u201d (Ether 2:22.) And the Lord replied, \u201cWhat will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?\u201d (Ether 2:23.)\nThe brother of Jared just a few short verses before this had been scolded by the Lord for a period of three hours for not praying to him. And in this environment, the brother of Jared went away to devise a specific plan. And when he did, he brought sixteen stones, beautiful crystals, laid them before the Lord on the top of Mount Shelem, and there asked the Lord to touch the stones with His finger.\nThe lesson I would like to bring out from this story is that when the Lord touched these stones, the brother of Jared saw His finger. The Lord said, as the brother of Jared fell to the ground, \u201cArise, why hast thou fallen?\u201d (Ether 3:7.)\nAnd the Lord got an answer that was quite remarkable when the brother of Jared, looking to the Lord, said, \u201cI knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.\u201d (Ether 3:8.) In verse 16 the Lord explained: \u201cBehold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh\u201d (Ether 3:16.)\nThe Lord asked if he had seen more of Him than His finger: \u201cSawest thou more than this?\u201d (Ether 3:9.) The brother of Jared answered, \u201cNay; Lord, show thyself unto me.\u201d (Ether 3:9\u201310.)\nThe Lord then asked the brother of Jared if he would believe in His words; and he said, \u201cYea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.\u201d (Ether 3:12.)\nThe Lord thus showed Himself twenty-five hundred years before He was actually born as a babe in Jerusalem. He then bore testimony of the fact that He would be Jesus the Christ, that He would come before His people, and that He would be the atoning sacrifice, that all mankind might live.\nAs we move closer to the atoning sacrifice in the Garden of Gethsemane, we find in John 17 that there Jesus offered an intercessory prayer. \u201cI have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do \u2026 before the world was.\u201d (John 17:4\u20135.) He then went on to say in verse 24, \u201cFor thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\u201d (John 17:24.)\nAnd so with the love of God the Father, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane. He dropped to His knees in prayer, even sweating great drops of blood. And then, as He departed to go out to see His disciples, He found them asleep. He asked, \u201cWhat, could ye not watch with me one hour?\u201d (Matt. 26:40.)\nHow many of us are sleeping when those around us are hurting and are in need? How many of us give our testimonies of the Lord, but then do not listen, as in 1 Jn. 4:20, \u201cFor he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\u201d\nHe then returned to the Garden of Gethsemane and asked His Father to help Him through this experience which He had to endure. And for you and me, there is great solace, for \u201cthere appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\u201d (Luke 22:43.)\nDo we not understand that we, too, will have moments in our lives when we will be brought to our knees, when we will need help to endure to the end? Even Joseph Smith showed impatience after being in jail for a few months and wondered why he could not get on with his mission. At that time the Lord said to Joseph, \u201cAll these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\u201d (D&C 122:7.) The ways in which we handle our trials are part of the maturing of the physical and spiritual man.\nAs a bishop, I have also learned from the atoning sacrifice a great lesson. In the trial where Pilate knew very well that the man before him was not guilty, he, for political reasons, had to bring in a verdict of guilty. And in this, Jesus was silent. We learn a good deal from this in our lives when enemies contend against us and when we are falsely accused. There are times when it is best to follow the Lord\u2019s example and not attempt to answer every accusation made against us.\nMany lessons can be learned from the account of the Atonement. It is comforting to know that, though suffering, Jesus Christ was able to look down from the cross and be concerned for His mother, that she should be properly cared for, as He asked for the help of a disciple. This is one of the great messages we have heard this conference\u2014that we turn some of our attention from our own trials and tribulations to concern and caring for others.\nEven in the closing moments of the life of Jesus a great lesson is to be learned. Jesus had cried with a loud voice, \u201cFather, into thy hands I commend my spirit.\u201d The verse goes on to say, \u201c\u2026 and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\u201d (Luke 23:46.) Jesus had endured to the end.\nOn earth there was great sorrow, and those beholding the Crucifixion smote their breasts. However, in heaven a multitude awaited the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world to declare their redemption from the bands of death. Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame. The spirit and the body were to be united, never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy. While the vast multitude waited and commenced rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared. He preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and redemption of mankind from the Fall and from individual sins on conditions of repentance. (See D&C 138:16\u201319.)\nThe lesson we can learn is that when a loved one has died and sorrow and despair have taken over our hearts, we can have solace knowing the joy that will come when our loved ones are reunited and continue their eternal progression because of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\nWith Jesus upon the cross were two other men being crucified, one on either side of Jesus. For me, as I see that setting, it is very clear that one accepted Jesus Christ and gave his testimony that Jesus was the Son of God, and the other rejected Him. This is typical of all mankind. Each one of us will someday, either in this life or in the life to come, have to give our testimony that He is truly the Son of God, the Savior of all mankind, Jesus Christ.\nIn the last moments upon the cross Jesus asked His Father a very simple question: \u201cWhy hast thou forsaken me?\u201d (Matt. 27:46.) Are there times in our lives when we think that we have been forsaken by God, or by our fellow men, or by our families? That is the moment when we have to turn our thoughts back to Christ and endure to the end. We know there is a great purpose in Christ\u2019s suffering because this was an act of free agency. Jesus could have called upon legions of angels to bring Him down from the cross, but He did not. He endured to the end that we would have the benefits of the atoning sacrifice; that mercy could be brought into the world; that justice would be satisfied; that we might be resurrected; and that we might be able to earn, through our obedience, eternal life in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ.\nI had an experience recently which further illustrates these principles. A father who was very wealthy asked if I could talk to his family. His daughter had recently been through a divorce. I went to see her and her children. Her father could have provided for all of their needs and cares, but he said it was time for them to live more modestly and to help support themselves, to be more self-sufficient, to be able to stand on their own. This experience is similar to the Lord\u2019s asking His Father, \u201cWhy hast thou forsaken me?\u201d for the family\u2019s reaction was, \u201cWhy would Father do this now when we need him the most?\u201d But you see, he was preparing them that they might be strengthened by providing for their own needs, so that when they did gain their inheritance, they would be able to endure to the end and remain self-sufficient.\nThere are times that we, as parents, must be able to cut our own children loose in order that they may learn to make decisions for themselves and have the strength to stand on their own.\nJesus taught us many lessons. But for me, one of the greatest lessons was taught after Jesus had died, and was resurrected, and came out of the sepulchre. There was Mary\u2014she did not recognize Him at first\u2014then upon recognizing Him, came toward Him. He said, \u201cTouch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father,\u201d (John 20:17), knowing that He was going to return to His Father in Heaven and then come back to earth and show himself to many as a resurrected being.\nWe started with a story from the Book of Mormon. Coming full circle back to 3 Nephi, I think of Jesus coming to the temple as a resurrected being after much devastation of the land, similar to what has happened in Mexico recently with earthquakes and rending of the land. In the account in 3 Nephi, the people who were there returned to the temple, and there the Lord came, introduced by His Father: \u201cBehold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name.\u201d (3 Ne. 11:7.) They were asked to listen to Him, and He descended among them. The most significant event is that the two thousand or so who were assembled at the temple each had the opportunity of thrusting his hands in the sides and in the wounds of the Savior to know of a surety that He lives. And for this they had a few centuries of peace in the land, and all were one.\nI ask the Lord\u2019s blessings to be with us, that we can understand the importance of the atoning sacrifice in our lives, that it is the greatest event in all history. In fact, the Atonement was the very purpose of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, coming to earth. Unfortunately, we sometimes deviate from that which we know.\nSome years ago, as a pilot, I was taken by an instructor up in an airplane. By turning the airplane at less than two degrees at a time, the instructor succeeded in turning the airplane completely upside down. My inner ear could not detect the transition because he kept positive gravity upon us at all times. Therefore, I did not know that, when he gave the airplane to me, it was upside down. Everything on the airplane, every instrument, was exactly right except for the landing gear, which was upside down; and every reaction I made had an opposite reaction from what I thought it would have. This is called vertigo, and it taught me a great lesson.\nI would like to talk for a moment about spiritual vertigo. Although we know of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, of His obedience, of His willingness to serve and to be an example to us, and of His message to \u201ccome, follow me,\u201d there are times when we get off course, less than a degree at a time, and do not know that we turn totally upside down.\nOne of the greatest messages that I ever received was from President Harold B. Lee. I was a young man visiting Salt Lake, and he asked me to come by his office. He knew something I didn\u2019t know\u2014that someone would be asking me to represent their organization. He put both of his hands on my shoulders, looked me directly in the eye, and said, \u201cBe careful who you give your name to.\u201d\nI believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is very careful whom He gives His name to. When we go into the waters of baptism, we take upon us His name and promise that we will always be obedient. Every time we take the sacrament, we remind ourselves that we will always remember Him, that we will take His name upon us, and that we will always keep His commandments. For that obedience, we are told that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. We will always have the spiritual gyroscope that will guide us so that we will never have to encounter spiritual vertigo and that we will never be off course.\nI ask the Lord\u2019s blessings to be with each of us, that we might be mindful of the small course corrections in our lives\u2014that we might be obedient to the Lord and follow His example of obedience.\nWe see the love God the Father has for His son, Jesus Christ, because He endured to the end, when He said, \u201cThis is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d May each of us endure to the end and be greeted by our maker, \u201cWell done thou good and faithful servant,\u201d is my prayer.\nI want to thank my sweetheart and companion for her love. I was once told by the chairman of an organization, \u201cYour greatest asset is your wife.\u201d That is a true statement.\nI bear you my testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. Of this I have no doubt. Of this I have never had a doubt since I was a young boy. I testify that the men who are seated here upon this stand\u2014The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve\u2014are prophets, seers, and revelators. I testify that a prophet of God is among us, even President Spencer W. Kimball, who in his enduring to the end is an example for all of us. That we may watch and be guided by his actions and his love is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRobert D. Hales\nLessons from the Atonement That Help Us to Endure to the End\n1985\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "When Adam and Eve willingly stepped into mortality, they knew this telestial world would contain thorns and thistles and troubles of every kind. Perhaps their most challenging realization, however, was not the hardship and danger they would endure but the fact that they would now be distanced from God, separated from Him with whom they had walked and talked, who had given them face-to-face counsel. After this conscious choice, as the record of creation says, \u201cthey saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.\u201d1 Amidst all else that must have troubled them, surely this must have troubled them the most.\nBut God knew the challenges they would face, and He certainly knew how lonely and troubled they would sometimes feel. So He watched over His mortal family constantly, heard their prayers always, and sent prophets (and later apostles) to teach, counsel, and guide them. But in times of special need, He sent angels, divine messengers, to bless His children, reassure them that heaven was always very close and that His help was always very near. Indeed, shortly after Adam and Eve found themselves in the lone and dreary world, an angel appeared unto them,2 who taught them the meaning of their sacrifice and the atoning role of the promised Redeemer who was to come.\nWhen the time for this Savior\u2019s advent was at hand, an angel was sent to announce to Mary that she was to be the mother of the Son of God.3 Then a host of angels was commissioned to sing on the night the baby Jesus was born.4 Shortly thereafter an angel would announce to Joseph that the newborn baby was in danger and that this little family must flee to Egypt for safety.5 When it was safe to return, an angel conveyed that information to the family and the three returned to the land of their heritage.6\nFrom the beginning down through the dispensations, God has used angels as His emissaries in conveying love and concern for His children. Time in this setting does not allow even a cursory examination of the scriptures or our own latter-day history, which are so filled with accounts of angels ministering to those on earth, but it is rich doctrine and rich history indeed.\nUsually such beings are not seen. Sometimes they are. But seen or unseen they are always near. Sometimes their assignments are very grand and have significance for the whole world. Sometimes the messages are more private. Occasionally the angelic purpose is to warn. But most often it is to comfort, to provide some form of merciful attention, guidance in difficult times. When in Lehi\u2019s dream he found himself in a frightening place, \u201ca dark and dreary waste,\u201d as he described it, he was met by an angel, \u201ca man \u2026 dressed in a white robe; \u2026 he spake unto me,\u201d Lehi said, \u201cand bade me follow him.\u201d7 Lehi did follow him to safety and ultimately to the path of salvation.\nIn the course of life all of us spend time in \u201cdark and dreary\u201d places, wildernesses, circumstances of sorrow or fear or discouragement. Our present day is filled with global distress over financial crises, energy problems, terrorist attacks, and natural calamities. These translate into individual and family concerns not only about homes in which to live and food available to eat but also about the ultimate safety and well-being of our children and the latter-day prophecies about our planet. More serious than these\u2014and sometimes related to them\u2014are matters of ethical, moral, and spiritual decay seen in populations large and small, at home and abroad. But I testify that angels are still sent to help us, even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve, to help the prophets, and indeed to help the Savior of the world Himself. Matthew records in his gospel that after Satan had tempted Christ in the wilderness \u201cangels came and ministered unto him.\u201d8 Even the Son of God, a God Himself, had need for heavenly comfort during His sojourn in mortality. And so such ministrations will be to the righteous until the end of time. As Mormon said to his son Moroni, who would one day be an angel:\n\u201cHas the day of miracles ceased?\n\u201cOr have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?\n\u201cBehold I say unto you, Nay; for \u2026 it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men. \u2026\n\u201cFor behold, they are subject unto [Christ], to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.\u201d9\nI ask everyone within the sound of my voice to take heart, be filled with faith, and remember the Lord has said He \u201cwould fight [our] battles, [our] children\u2019s battles, and [the battles of our] children\u2019s children.\u201d10 And what do we do to merit such a defense? We are to \u201csearch diligently, pray always, and be believing[. Then] all things shall work together for [our] good, if [we] walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith [we] have covenanted.\u201d11 The latter days are not a time to fear and tremble. They are a time to be believing and remember our covenants.\nI have spoken here of heavenly help, of angels dispatched to bless us in time of need. But when we speak of those who are instruments in the hand of God, we are reminded that not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some of them we walk with and talk with\u2014here, now, every day. Some of them reside in our own neighborhoods. Some of them gave birth to us, and in my case, one of them consented to marry me. Indeed heaven never seems closer than when we see the love of God manifested in the kindness and devotion of people so good and so pure that angelic is the only word that comes to mind. Elder James Dunn, from this pulpit just moments ago, used that word in his invocation to describe this Primary choir\u2014and why not? With the spirit, faces, and voices of those children in our mind and before our eyes, may I share with you an account by my friend and BYU colleague, the late Clyn D. Barrus. I do so with the permission of his wife, Marilyn, and their family.\nReferring to his childhood on a large Idaho farm, Brother Barrus spoke of his nightly assignment to round up the cows at milking time. Because the cows pastured in a field bordered by the occasionally treacherous Teton River, the strict rule in the Barrus household was that during the spring flood season the children were never to go after any cows who ventured across the river. They were always to return home and seek mature help.\nOne Saturday just after his seventh birthday, Brother Barrus\u2019s parents promised the family a night at the movies if the chores were done on time. But when young Clyn arrived at the pasture, the cows he sought had crossed the river, even though it was running at high flood stage. Knowing his rare night at the movies was in jeopardy, he decided to go after the cows himself, even though he had been warned many times never to do so.\nAs the seven-year-old urged his old horse, Banner, down into the cold, swift stream, the horse\u2019s head barely cleared the water. An adult sitting on the horse would have been safe, but at Brother Barrus\u2019s tender age, the current completely covered him except when the horse lunged forward several times, bringing Clyn\u2019s head above water just enough to gasp for air.\nHere I turn to Brother Barrus\u2019s own words:\n\u201cWhen Banner finally climbed the other bank, I realized that my life had been in grave danger and that I had done a terrible thing\u2014I had knowingly disobeyed my father. I felt that I could redeem myself only by bringing the cows home safely. Maybe then my father would forgive me. But it was already dusk, and I didn\u2019t know for sure where I was. Despair overwhelmed me. I was wet and cold, lost and afraid.\n\u201cI climbed down from old Banner, fell to the ground by his feet, and began to cry. Between thick sobs, I tried to offer a prayer, repeating over and over to my Father in Heaven, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. Forgive me! I\u2019m sorry. Forgive me!\u2019\n\u201cI prayed for a long time. When I finally looked up, I saw through my tears a figure dressed in white walking toward me. In the dark, I felt certain it must be an angel sent in answer to my prayers. I did not move or make a sound as the figure approached, so overwhelmed was I by what I saw. Would the Lord really send an angel to me, who had been so disobedient?\n\u201cThen a familiar voice said, \u2018Son, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u2019 In the darkness I recognized the voice of my father and ran to his outstretched arms. He held me tightly, then said gently, \u2018I was worried. I\u2019m glad I found you.\u2019\n\u201cI tried to tell him how sorry I was, but only disjointed words came out of my trembling lips\u2014\u2018Thank you \u2026 darkness \u2026 afraid \u2026 river \u2026 alone.\u2019 Later that night I learned that when I had not returned from the pasture, my father had come looking for me. When neither I nor the cows were to be found, he knew I had crossed the river and was in danger. Because it was dark and time was of the essence, he removed his clothes down to his long white thermal underwear, tied his shoes around his neck, and swam a treacherous river to rescue a wayward son.\u201d12\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I testify of angels, both the heavenly and the mortal kind. In doing so I am testifying that God never leaves us alone, never leaves us unaided in the challenges that we face. \u201c[N]or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man [or woman or child] upon the face thereof to be saved.\u201d13 On occasions, global or personal, we may feel we are distanced from God, shut out from heaven, lost, alone in dark and dreary places. Often enough that distress can be of our own making, but even then the Father of us all is watching and assisting. And always there are those angels who come and go all around us, seen and unseen, known and unknown, mortal and immortal.\nMay we all believe more readily in, and have more gratitude for, the Lord\u2019s promise as contained in one of President Monson\u2019s favorite scriptures: \u201cI will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, \u2026 my Spirit shall be in your [heart], and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d14 In the process of praying for those angels to attend us, may we all try to be a little more angelic ourselves\u2014with a kind word, a strong arm, a declaration of faith and \u201cthe covenant wherewith [we] have covenanted.\u201d15 Perhaps then we can be emissaries sent from God when someone, perhaps a Primary child, is crying, \u201cDarkness \u2026 afraid \u2026 river \u2026 alone.\u201d To this end I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElder Jeffrey R.

Please know how I love Relief Society. I know the love and peace and unity that it brings into the lives of women of this church. Relief Society has been a source of strength in my life, it has helped me raise my family, it has been at the heart of my closest friendships, it has prompted me to learn and grow in the gospel. It has helped me keep my focus on Jesus Christ and what he would have me do.\nWhen I was called as general president of Relief Society, I was given counsel by President Thomas S. Monson. I want to share with you just a little of what he said:\n\u201cThis is a time of great change in the world and in the Church as we observe modifications in family style and family characteristics. We recognize that there are many single-parent families; there are other families where difficulties exist between husbands and wives, and furthermore, we find the encroachment of the drug culture and other challenges which cause stress in families. You at this hour of need have been called \u2026 to direct the organization which can provide that ameliorating influence, that balm of Gilead to unite all sisters in the Church.\u201d\nTonight I want to talk about President Monson\u2019s counsel. I want to talk about our families, about Relief Society, and how this great organization can be a balm of Gilead to all of us, particularly in helping us at home.\nI know of two visiting teachers who had barely begun talking to a sister in her home when her two teenage daughters bounced in, announcing they were going to Young Women. Her husband, who also was leaving for an evening of meetings, detained their three-year-old son, who was determined to accompany his older sisters. Two other girls were arguing in the next room over which video to watch. When all the doors closed, the mother started to cry. It had been, she explained, a long week.\nThe visiting teachers wisely gave this very busy wife and mother a chance to talk. She discussed her week and how much she was missing her recently deceased mother. The three talked and shared their understanding of the gospel and the difficulties of every day application. The visiting teachers\u2014one is single and has no children and the other is a single parent\u2014praised their sister for all she was doing to raise her family well.\nThe mother felt better. The visiting teachers grew closer to each other and to this dear sister. They all felt better. In the true spirit of Relief Society, these visiting teachers strengthened this sister and her home. I feel better. Why? Because this story witnesses what I know\u2014that Relief Society is indeed a balm that unites us, that helps us in our families. Sisters, I testify to you that one of our most important roles as Relief Society members is to strengthen each other, so all of us are better able to help our families. We come together. We learn from each other. We go home and strengthen our families. It\u2019s that simple, yet how profound it is that we have this organization to be our balm of Gilead.\nPresident Boyd K. Packer, in a talk to the women of the Church, quoted the First Presidency:\n\u201cWe ask our Sisters of the Relief Society never to forget that they are a unique organization in the whole world, for they were organized under the inspiration of the Lord. \u2026 No other women\u2019s organization in all the earth has had such a birth\u201d (Ensign, Nov. 1980, p. 111).\nThat divine direction continues today as priesthood leaders counsel with us, give us guidance, encouragement, and inspiration. I am grateful for our prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, and for the General Authorities of this church who reverence the work of Relief Society.\nWe honor the trust we have been given to show charity, to build individual testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to strengthen the families of the Church and focus on living the gospel. We do it in our meetings, in our homes, in our associations. This spiritual perspective is the balm of Gilead, that ameliorating influence spoken of by President Monson that brings peace to the soul. We carry this balm with us all the time, and it makes the difference.\nSpiritual peace is in short supply these days. For many in the world this is a time of confusion, mixed signals, scrambled priorities. There will always be problems and pressing issues to draw our attention from the work of the Lord. Remember, Relief Society is the Lord\u2019s organization for women. It is much more than a class we attend on Sunday. Service in Relief Society magnifies every sister. A sister from Virginia wrote:\n\u201cI have served in almost all of the callings [in Relief Society] and obtained a deep love for this auxiliary which has helped to educate me in several ways. I see those years as the most spiritual and enjoyable of my experience in the Church. Relief Society has taught me that I am a person of worth\u201d (Loretta H. Ison, Big Stone Gap, Virginia).\nIn Relief Society we hold constant the virtues relating to women, mothers, families, and righteous living. At peace with this God-defined direction, Relief Society sisters can bring this balm of Gilead to troubled times. We have the spiritual resources of faith, hope, and compassion to apply as the balm.\nIn ancient days the balm of Gilead was an aromatic spice used to heal and soothe. Made from a bush or a tree that grew plentifully around Gilead, it was a popularly traded commodity, always in high demand. The strength of the balm is familiar to us through the words of a hymn:\nThere is a Balm in Gilead,\nTo make the wounded whole,\nThere is a Balm in Gilead,\nTo heal the sin sick soul.\nAs a presidency we desire that every sister in the Church recognize the significance of her service and be magnified in her work in the kingdom of God on earth. Sisters, ours is a sacred calling. As we devote ourselves to the purposes of Relief Society, we will see many of the problems reversed that are plaguing our homes and our communities.\nThe very name \u201cRelief Society\u201d describes our purpose: to provide relief. While we often have the desire and the natural tendency as women to fix what\u2019s broken, we are not the \u201csolution society.\u201d We are the Relief Society. We understand the power and strength of the fruits of the Spirit described in Galatians: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith (Gal. 5:22; emphasis added). We can soothe a suffering heart when we can\u2019t eliminate the trouble. We can bring reassurance and support, kindness, and calm.\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith was suffering in Liberty Jail, he wrote of the balm he received from his friends. He said:\n\u201cThose who have not been enclosed in the walls of prison without cause \u2026 can have but little idea how sweet the voice of a friend is; one token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and calls into action every sympathetic feeling; \u2026 then the voice of inspiration steals along and whispers, \u2026 \u2018peace be unto thy soul\u2019\u201d (History of the Church, 3:293).\nJoseph recognized the role each of us plays in lifting, helping, and soothing so that the calamities of life can be stilled and the Lord\u2019s voice can be heard.\nThis is the balm applied by the women of Relief Society today. In our worldwide church there are countless numbers of sisters who put their families first: women who read and ponder the scriptures, who follow the counsel of the living prophets; women who are serving in demanding callings, from setting up wilderness camps for Laurels to teaching the Articles of Faith to Primary children to greeting at the door of Relief Society on Sunday morning; and the world is blessed by their influence.\nSo much of our contribution is done in quiet ways, one sister at a time. It has always been so. I think of Mary who bathed Christ\u2019s feet after his hot and dusty journey and then dried his feet with her hair before applying a healing ointment (see John 12:3). I think of Dorcas, sometimes called the Relief Society sister of the New Testament because her life through her good deeds prompted the women to weep and wail at her passing. They pleaded with Peter to restore her to life (see Acts 9:36\u201339). I think of Helen who works with me at the general Relief Society offices. Untiring, patient, accommodating of all, Helen is a source of peace. She gives me comfort because I know she is always there, even and fine.\nI have been privileged to meet many of you. Thank you for the steadfast love you extend to one another, for your example, for your service. Thank you for putting your arms around each other and drawing each other into the circle of sisters that is the heart and soul of a branch, a ward, or a stake.\nThe fifth general president of Relief Society, Emmeline B. Wells, described the influence of the sisters when she said, \u201cThe sun never sets on the Relief Society\u201d (\u201cR.S. Reports: Alpine Stake,\u201d Woman\u2019s Exponent, Aug. 1904, p. 21).\nI have been to Relief Society gatherings in many parts of the world, and I know that the Lord has no finer forces than the good women in these congregations. Our balm of Gilead takes many forms for we minister with both our hearts and our hands.\nI remember receiving a report from a sister in Georgia assigned to survey the damage done to homes in her stake after severe flooding in their area. She went into the kitchen of one home sloshing through mud above her ankles, and opened a cupboard. Inside was coiled a water moccasin snake. She quickly shut the door and tried another cupboard where she was eye-to-eye with yet another snake. In consternation she ran up the stairs to the second floor where she met up with an alligator. I\u2019d class that as heroic charity.\nA mother in North Carolina who had been cared for by willing Relief Society sisters during an illness said, \u201cThe sisters have taught me a lesson about the worth of a soul and that even at the bottom, stripped of all roles, titles, and responsibilities, we are valuable to our Father in Heaven and to each other and that charity never faileth.\u201d\nWherever we are, we can carry with us a reserve of our balm of Gilead and we can spread it around. It can be as simple as finding a seat in the room by someone who needs you. It may be a thoughtful comment in a lesson that answers another one\u2019s prayer. It may be catching someone\u2019s eye, lifting a child for a drink from a fountain, sending a note in the mail, reading the scriptures with someone. Or it may be visiting someone you\u2019ve missed at meetings, someone you hear mentioned in your heart by the still, small voice. These little actions inspire us; they take the edges off our problems. Indeed, \u201cOut of small things proceedeth that which is great\u201d (D&C 64:33). The giver and the receiver are both blessed.\nOur strength as Relief Society sisters in the gospel is most visible and most critical at home. Women are the heart of the home. Whatever your circumstance, you are the heart of your home. I call on you to sanctify your home, to make strengthening and nurturing your family your first priority.\nMy sister and I speak often about the family in which we grew up. We were born of goodly parents. My mother was a devoted member of the Relief Society in Cardston, Alberta, Canada. As I was growing up, I felt the influence of the Relief Society sisters in my ward. I realize now that they were one of the constants in my life. My dear father had an unwavering testimony, and at age eighty-eight he gave me his final priesthood blessing. Our grandparents lived just next door, something that doesn\u2019t happen much anymore. My grandfather served as the stake patriarch, and I served as his transcriber. What a rich blessing that was in my life. My sister, Jean, and I have happy, peaceful memories of our years at home.\nHomes can be sacred havens from the world. Homes offer not only physical shelter but a feeling of security, a sense of belonging, a closeness with other family members. Families live in homes. Families are made up of mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, and grandmothers. They also have grandfathers, uncles, brothers, sons, and fathers.\nFamilies bring us our greatest joys and sometimes our most wrenching heartaches. Families provide a learning environment, a schoolroom from which we never graduate but can always learn. In our families we learn to appreciate the spiritual peace that comes from applying the principles of charity, of patience, sharing, integrity, kindness, generosity, self-control, and service. These are more than family values, sisters; these are the Lord\u2019s way of life.\nThe purpose of the Relief Society organization of the Church, stated in our handbook, is to help women and their families come unto Christ. This means bringing the influence of Jesus Christ into our homes. It means we focus on his gospel and we find joy in living his commandments. It means we reexamine our time commitments, and give emphasis to becoming a family that is united and at peace.\nIt\u2019s no news to you that this is no easy job. All forms of the media comment on the fragmentation or even the demise of the family. Economic pressures force families to make difficult choices. We\u2019re pulled in myriad directions, and yet we must hold gospel principles firmly in place. Our efforts may seem unnoticed and unappreciated, but sisters, they are worth it. Families are the framework of our lives here and in the eternities. That families are sealed together indicates their central purpose in the Lord\u2019s plan. And women have a key role in the family. We set the tone in our homes; we set the pattern for daily living; we set the standards for how people are treated; we are teacher, counselor, confidante, advocate, supporter, and companion.\nWe have a long and significant track record in Relief Society for putting families first. The \u201cMother\u2019s Class\u201d was the first standardized lesson taught in Relief Society. Starting in 1901, these lessons were the original Mother Education course. The intent was to help sisters manage their homes, inspire their children, teach the gospel, and live exemplary lives. Just as we do now.\nIn our Relief Society today, we study one lesson a month and focus it on the needs of homes and families. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Homes and families are a central frame of reference in all lessons.\nBecause families are close to our hearts, they make us hurt sometimes. Take Lehi and Sariah as an example. How did they feel about the constant bickering of Laman and Lemuel? When Joseph was sold into Egypt, what did he think of his brothers? Did Queen Esther really want to hear from her Uncle Mordecai, \u201cWho knoweth whether thou art come \u2026 for such a time as this?\u201d (Esth. 4:14.)\nFamilies signify responsibility to and for each other. This spring my seven-year-old grandson, David, called to see if I could come to his class\u2019s spring concert because, he said, \u201cI have a solo part.\u201d It was on a Tuesday, my busiest day, but I promised I would try. On the day of the program, I was there, straining with his parents to identify our little David amidst the sea of faces framed by Mickey Mouse ears. David did have a solo; every child in the class had a solo. But the reward came at the end of the program when he bounded down the aisle saying, \u201cGrandma, I knew you\u2019d come.\u201d\nA friend spoke to me recently of her father, who had suffered a stroke. She faced a hard time of life as she tried to determine the best way to care for and support him and also consider her mother, who had good health and days still filled with promise and grandchildren. Then my friend spoke of the reverence she felt for this time. She said, \u201cI am finding I enjoy learning from him, watching him deal with this difficult process of an aging body.\u201d\nAt the most difficult times our families can hold us steady. We learn this well from one of the most wrenching experiences in the history of the world, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\nWe read in John, \u201cThere stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother\u2019s sister\u201d (John 19:25). They were there as they had been throughout his life. My mind darts back to the early years as Mary and Joseph raised this most remarkable child. I can hear Mary comforting the baby Jesus with soothing words that come so naturally to us: \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d And then at this most dramatic moment of all time, there was the mother, Mary. She couldn\u2019t soothe his pain this time, but she could stand by his side. Jesus, in tribute, offered those grand words, \u201cWoman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!\u201d (John 19:26\u201327.)\nMy sisters of Relief Society, we are the bearers of the balm of Gilead. May your Relief Society sisterhood soothe and bless you. May you know how I support you in all you do for and with your families. May you feel the ameliorating influence, the balm of Relief Society.\nI leave you with my testimony that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, and that his gospel has been restored in these latter days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElaine L. Jack\nRelief Society:A Balm in Gilead\n1995\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "Have you ever had the experience, as you left your home for a youth activity, to hear your mother say, \u201cNow, Son, remember who you are\u201d? Did you wonder each time, Why does she always say that? And, by the way, who am I?\nOthers have also asked this very important question:\n\u201cMoses said unto God, Who am I?\u201d1\n\u201cThen went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who am I, O Lord God?\u201d2\nAmong the magnificent and abundant teachings of President Howard W. Hunter is this assertion, \u201cThe greatest search of our time is the search for personal identity and for human dignity.\u201d3 This search for personal identity is essentially a search for role models that can become instructive in the conduct of our lifestyles. With only a few exceptions, a young person cannot find adequate role models among those in athletics, entertainment, or commercial music. Not only do these public figures fail to provide positive examples, but they are often the exact inverse of the type of role models that are acceptable to most of us. Access to these contemporary icons is expensive and unproductive. We are almost always disappointed when we come to witness the shallow and murky standards by which the public heaps its praise. No wonder the public areas of so many cities and towns are crowded with young people who are possessed with these same shallow and murky standards of personal behavior.\nYet there is an abundance of role models who can be found much closer and who can have much deeper influence upon each one of us. Most of us, with relatively little effort and much less cost, can provide for our families a veritable list of important role models. This list can be created from a modest search into the lives of our ancestors. Let me give you a few examples:\nA few years ago, as a birthday gift, I went to the FamilySearch\u00ae system and retrieved my wife\u2019s entire recorded family pedigree. That was a serious mistake. The computer revealed that my wife is a descendant of European royalty. It has been hard to live with her ever since. Maybe now, through this knowledge of her family history, I am more inclined to treat her as our family queen. But the biggest problem, of course, is that my children share in this royal ancestry, which, sadly, makes me the only \u201ccommoner\u201d in my family.\nManasseh Byrd Kearl, born in 1870 and raised near Bear Lake in northern Utah, tells a wonderful story that might be instructional to his descendants, of which I am one. Let me read from his journal:\n\u201cThat fall father bought some cattle for John Dikens, a very large herd. Dikens had a large ranch on Bear River. \u2026 I remember Jimmie was down north buying cattle and he sent father that he needed more money. So father toled me to take some money to him. Mother sewed six hundred dollars in my under clothes, and father put me on a horse and said, \u2018Now Byrdie my boy, don\u2019t you get off this horse till you find your brother Jimmie, and keep your mouth shut, and if any one asks you questions don\u2019t reply or tell them where you are going, and do not give this money to any one but Jimmie, no matter what any one tells you.\u2019 Well, when I got to DingleDell, I was toled Jimmie was in Montpelier. So to Montpelier I went to Joe Richs, a friend of father\u2019s, he toled me that Jimmie had gone home. Brother Rich wanted me to go in the house and get something to eat. I toled him no, that father toled me not to get off this horse till I found Jim, and here I stayed. I turned around and headed for home. When I got to Bears Valley, \u2026 I could hardly walk. Mr. Potter tried to get me to stop and rest, but I could not stay. At last I got home. Jimmie took me off the horse and carried me into the house. Mother cried to think I had been in the saddle while the horse went over eighty miles.\u201d4\nLet us consider also the eloquent language of Gustave Henriod:\n\u201cYou, my kind reader, will never know the sports and vicissitudes, joys and fears, gladness and disappointment, grief and delight, cravings and satisfactions, hope and despair, anxiety and contentment, pains and pleasures, all of which are familiar associates, or rather were in the year 1853 between Omaha and Salt Lake City. Yoking up half wild oxen every morning, staking down the tent every night, picking up buffalo chips to cook the food, loading and unloading boxes and bedding mornings and evenings, in the saddle or on foot guarding the stock every night and driving loose cattle in the day, digging trenches around the tents to keep from being drowned by the torrents, singing the songs of Zion, mending a broken wagon, \u2026 washing your clothes\u2014everybody forgot a clothes line.\u201d5\nAnother important quality to emulate is humor in the face of challenge. Hannah Cornaby, another member of the 1853 migration, wrote:\n\u201cIt was three years, to a day, from that memorable first of June \u2026, when our oxen having arrived, we left Keokuk. I wish I could afford a page to a description of our starting. The oxen were wild, and getting them yoked was the most laughable sight I had ever witnessed; everybody giving orders, and nobody knowing how to carry them out. If the men had not been saints, there would doubtless have been much profane language used; but the oxen, not understanding \u2018English,\u2019 did just as well without it. But it did seem so truly comical to witness the bewildered look of some innocent brother, who, after having labored an hour or more to get [an ox] secured to one end of the yoke, would hold the other end aloft, trying to persuade [the other ox] to come under, only to see [the first] careering across the country, the yoke lashing the air, and he not even giving a hint as to when he intended to stop.\u201d6\nOf course, there were political and social conflicts in the lives of some of our ancestors, but even these become instructional in the ways they dealt with their circumstances. John Davies was a loyalist during the American Revolutionary War. He had been instrumental in the establishment of the Church of England in America, which became known as the First Episcopal Society of Litchfield. These early immigrants had been taught that next to religion, loyalty was the cardinal virtue. They honestly considered that none but the infidel and traitor would venture to speak of revolution from the motherland. Some argued that any attempt to independence was rank ingratitude. They considered the king to be the head not only of their state but also of their religion.\nJohn Davies recounts the challenge of building their first church in Litchfield, Connecticut, only to have it seriously damaged by soldiers of the Revolution. His cattle were run off by revolutionists and much of his property severely damaged because of significant persecution of those who had remained loyal to the king. Listen to this about John Davies:\n\u201cAfter the close of the war a man who had taken an active part in driving off a number of cattle from his farm, and had committed other acts of plunder, having become destitute, applied for relief in his extremity to Mr. Davies, who not only pardoned him for the wrongs he had done, but liberally relieved his wants.\u201d7\nTamma Miner\u2019s first husband, Albert, died in January of 1848 when their youngest child was not yet two years old and their oldest only fifteen years of age. Tamma\u2019s father, Edmond, was murdered by a mob at Nauvoo, Illinois, when Tamma was thirty-two and expecting her ninth child. Their daughter, Melissa, died during the persecution era at seven months; their son, Orson, died of a fever at seventeen; and another daughter, Sylvia, died at age two. Tamma, with her five remaining boys and two girls, started the journey to Salt Lake City across the Plains on June 10, 1850. Tamma\u2019s writings include this wonderful declaration:\n\u201cI have passed through all the hardships and drivings and burnings and mobbings and threatenings and have been with the Saints in all their persecutions from Huron county to Kirtland and from Kirtland to Missouri back to Illinois and then across the desert. I write this that my children may have a little idea of what their parents passed through. I hope my children will appreciate these lines for I do feel highly honored to be numbered with the Latter-day Saints.\u201d8\nThese are a few great examples of role models which are available to all of us as we learn of our own family history.\nRecently, we met with an executive of a large entertainment corporation. Among her many fine credentials, this corporate leader is of Jewish ethnicity. She obviously enjoyed a tour of our Family History Library and a demonstration of the Church\u2019s commitment to the gathering and preserving of vital records from all over the world. As our meeting ended, she asked me a question, \u201cWhy is your church so interested in genealogy?\u201d\nI responded, \u201cLet me answer you by asking you the same question, why are Jews interested in their genealogy?\u201d\nShe answered, a little surprised by my query: \u201cWhy? It is of ultimate and profound importance. It is how we obtain and maintain our identity. It is how I know who I am. The history and lives of our ancestors are the glue that holds the entire Jewish community together.\u201d She concluded, \u201cHow else would you know who you are?\u201d\nI responded to her, \u201cThat is also one of the reasons why our church is interested in genealogy.\u201d\nMy brethren of the priesthood, how do we now answer this centuries-old question: Who am I?\nFirst of all, we are sons of God created in His image. We are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Our connection and identification with the Church has been maintained by many of our members for more than a century and a half. Without question, the environment of our homes and families is the single greatest influence in our identity as individuals. This was true of our parents\u2019 families and their parents\u2019 families before them. We need not look beyond our own family to find wonderful role models whose high standards are more than adequate in our search for our own personal identity. As Elder Russell M. Nelson taught us this afternoon, we are children of the covenant.\nFor our own families comes this magnificent promise:\n\u201cTherefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers\u2014\n\u201cFor ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God\u2014\n\u201cTherefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.\u201d9 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMonte J. Brough\nSearch for Identity\n1995\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "I would be ungrateful this morning if I didn\u2019t express my appreciation for walking in the shadow of two great and holy men, Bishop Brown and Bishop Peterson, and for letting you know that I have a personal witness that J. Richard Clarke is a suited companion for these great men.\nThis morning I have the assignment from Bishop Brown to discuss employment responsibilities. Six months ago Bishop Peterson discussed employment.\nSometime back a mother took her son, Freddie, to the LDS hospital for an operation. The boy was operated on and all went well. That evening at 7:00 P.M., Freddie\u2019s mother went to the head nurse and said, \u201cI would like to leave now, and I would like you to check on Freddie every half hour.\u201d\nThe nurse said, \u201cWell, we will check on him regularly, but we don\u2019t have time to check on him every half hour.\u201d\nThe mother said, \u201cIf you will not check on him every half hour, then I will not leave. I will stay here all night.\u201d\nThe nurse said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that; I personally will check on him every half hour.\u201d\nSo the mother left and went home. The hospital has a central station and two long wings. Freddie was in the last room. At 7:30 P.M. the nurse made her way down the long hallway and put her head in the door and said, \u201cFreddie, is everything all right?\u201d\nHe responded, \u201cYes, everything is fine.\u201d\nShe walked down the hall and it was almost 8:00. She turned around and went back to Freddie\u2019s room and said, \u201cFreddie, are you all right?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m doing okay.\u201d\nShe made the long trip back to her central station. She did this at 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, and 10:00. Finally she thought, \u201cI am not getting any work done. I\u2019ve got to change systems of checking on Freddie.\u201d\nShe decided to use the intercom. She pushed the button and said, \u201cFreddie, are you all right?\u201d Not a sound.\n\u201cFreddie, are you okay?\u201d Nothing. \u201cFreddie, are you all right\u2014speak to me!\u201d\nAnd a very timid voice said, \u201cYes, wall, what do you want?\u201d\nI think as we talk about unemployment\u2014and Bishop Peterson discussed it last time and I this morning\u2014we do not think we\u2019re talking to the wall; but repetition is a good teacher.\nWe constantly teach, and it has been taught from the beginning, that a man should be completely self-reliant and able to take care of himself and his family. This is an eternal and true principle. Many in the Church have attained such total self-reliance. Each individual has the responsibility to take care of his own employment needs. Yet, sometimes as quorum or ward leaders we consider this principle and withdraw from our responsibility, feeling that the individual can work out his own problems. The fact is that we have a great responsibility. To help us to understand and fulfill that responsibility, there are two principles regarding employment that I should like to discuss:\nIt is true that the individual must be self-reliant.\nThis does not relieve quorum and other ward members from their immediate obligation to that individual.\nWhenever a person in the ward is unemployed, the individual has primary responsibility to locate another job. Where he is unable to find a job, his family should help. Quorum and ward assistance should be offered in the very beginning, when the individual is first out of work.\nThe longer the time between the loss of one\u2019s job and the finding of another, the more difficult it is to find work. Several things are involved.\nThe individual loses his confidence.\nPressures\u2014mental, physical, and financial\u2014clutter the mind, and thinking becomes clouded.\nImage of self-worth is reduced significantly with each passing day.\nThe stigma placed upon the one seeking employment by the community and potential employers is, \u201cIf he had anything on the ball he would have a job. He must have some hang-ups\u2014I dare not hire him.\u201d\nThe longer the period of unemployment, the harder it is for the individual to go back to work even if he has an opportunity.\nIn a talk entitled \u201cFreedom, A Terrible Risk,\u201d by Harvey Jacobs, he related the following:\n\u201cIn a Japanese novel of several years ago, the main character, wandering in a strange village, becomes trapped in the bottom of a sand pit. Food and water are lowered to him but no ladder. He wants out desperately. He begs his captors to let him go. He tries to bargain with them but nothing works. Months pass. The begging, the scheming becomes a way of life. After a long time he is granted what he wants, what he has been striving for with all his will, day and night\u2014the freedom to come out of his pit and go on his way in complete freedom.\n\u201cSuddenly he is afraid, he is alarmed by the prospect of facing the world without protection. He could get lost, he thinks. In his little pit he was at least sheltered from unknown harm. Now he understands that freedom is not a reward but a terrible risk.\u201d\nThose of us who have never been out of work would find it difficult to understand the mental anxiety and loss of confidence that comes from a long period of unemployment. Plato said that the very most important part of any project is the very beginning. (See The Republic, bk. 1,377b.)\nNow what can be done by the quorum and ward to solve employment needs by members, and how do we do it?\nStake presidents and bishops, instruct your stake and ward welfare services committees in employment matters, particularly the principles we outline in these welfare sessions of conference.\nQuorum presidents and bishops, contact the unemployed member immediately, as soon as you know he is out of work. Do not wait until Sunday. Counsel those who are unemployed to do the following (some of these suggestions might not be locally applicable, but the principles are universal; use every personal resource possible):\nResolve to work at looking for a job. Get up every morning at 7:00 A.M., shower, clean up, have prayer and breakfast, and leave at 8:00 A.M. to look for a job. Spend several hours each day looking for a job.\nWhile endeavoring to find a job\u2014\nPlan and outline exactly what the course of action will be for the next day\u2019s searching for a job. Here again is an excellent opportunity for one or more resource persons to do some creative thinking and dialoguing with the unemployed person.\nDress appropriately for the interview. This gives confidence and creates a good first impression. Be willing to start at the bottom and work up. Be willing to prove yourself to a new employer.\nPay tithing even though it may be all the money you have. The Lord\u2019s blessings are needed, and this is one way of assuring them.\nIII. Quorum presidents and bishops, talk with the unemployed individual and\u2014\nrebuild his self-image;\ninstruct him as previously listed;\nC. lay your hands on his head and give him a special blessing where such is requested;\nD. make the resources of the quorum and ward available as needed.\nIV. If work does not come at first, stay close to the unemployed individual so he can have someone with whom he can review his frustrations and keep him thinking positively.\nV. Call in as many resource persons as necessary to help. The greatest resource, of course, is the combined talents of the quorum. Each quorum member should be involved by assignment to assist in finding job openings.\nVI. There may be occasions that warrant the quorum members\u2019 assisting while the individual \u201cretools\u201d through vocational training\u2014or the quorum may be called upon to assist in setting a member up in business.\nThe great blessing of the quorum and the ward is that instead of one person feeling lost and alone, he will feel that there are a hundred people or more working to help him find a job. The ward welfare services committee discusses the needs of the individual. Each member of the quorum or group presidency immediately involves quorum or group members to help locate employment. Thus the entire priesthood unit becomes involved by assisting in trying to locate job openings.\nIn 1937, Elder Harold B. Lee said, \u201cIt must surely be apparent to all that every step the unemployed person takes away from the circle of his quorum carries him that much further from possible employment.\u201d\nWhen necessary, get the entire ward involved. When we do, we have 100 times more exposure, we have 100 times more chance for success. It is one thing to talk about a problem and another thing to actually contribute to the solution. Ward welfare services committees are organized to get results. A quorum and ward totally united in fasting, prayer, and works on behalf of one individual in need of work will produce miracles.\nA convict was being escorted by two armed guards down a hall between a row of cellblocks. One of the inmates asked him where he was going.\n\u201cTo the electric chair,\u201d he responded.\n\u201cWell, more power to you, boy!\u201d\nWe have power when we involve the quorum and the ward.\nEvery ward should have a functioning employment system. It includes the individual, the quorum, the ward, the stake, the region, and community resources available. Some areas have Church employment centers, but these are organized to compensate for lack of total quorum and ward commitment. This is because the priesthood have not accepted and are not living or functioning the way the Lord would have us do. In the past the process from the quorum, to the ward, to the stake, to the region has been too slow. Not because the principle is wrong, but because priesthood leaders are not functioning properly in this area of their stewardship. Jobs are lost due to time lag between employment needs being matched with employment opportunities.\nWe as a people do not understand the quorum organization yet. When we do, we will find there will be a \u201cpower surge\u201d through the Church that will electrify the world. The priesthood quorum is the Lord\u2019s organization for the brotherhood of men and brethren in the kingdom. The quorum is to function primarily to assist the quorum member in spiritual growth and development. The temporal welfare of every quorum member is also the responsibility of every other quorum member.\nThere is a holy brotherhood in a good quorum that draws the members together with bands stronger than steel. The quorum is a brotherhood of charity wherein the \u201cpure love of Christ\u201d prevails. When this \u201ccharity\u201d pervades all that is done, then every member has a Christlike interest in every other member. Quorum members feel the weight of the burden which is carried by their unemployed brother as though they themselves were unemployed. They are motivated to action. The correlation and efforts of the quorum are directed by the quorum president.\nThe bishop, through his counselor responsible for personal welfare matters, has the duty to correlate employment-finding activities outside the quorums.\nGod bless you, our beloved leaders, to have charity for the unfortunate, which charity is the true love of Christ. \u201cFor now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\u201d (1 Cor. 13:13.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nVaughn J.

Harriet and I remember it well because I was serving in the Europe Area Presidency at the time. Along with many others, we spent countless hours attending to the details of planning and organizing the events leading up to the dedication.\nAs the date of the dedication approached, I noticed that I had not yet received an invitation to attend. This was a bit unexpected. After all, in my responsibility as the Area President, I had been greatly involved in this temple project and felt a small amount of ownership for it.\nI asked Harriet if she had seen an invitation. She had not.\nDays passed and my anxiety increased. I wondered if our invitation had gotten lost\u2014perhaps it was buried between the cushions of our sofa. Maybe it had been mixed up with junk mail and thrown away. The neighbors had an inquisitive cat, and I even began to look suspiciously at him.\nFinally I was forced to accept the fact: I had not been invited.\nBut how was that possible? Had I done something to offend? Did someone just assume it was too far for us to travel? Had I been forgotten?\nEventually, I realized that this line of thinking led to a place in which I did not wish to take up residence.\nHarriet and I reminded ourselves that the temple dedication was not about us. It wasn\u2019t about who deserved to be invited or who did not. And it wasn\u2019t about our feelings or our sense of entitlement.\nIt was about dedicating a holy edifice, a temple of the Most High God. It was a day of rejoicing for the members of the Church in Spain.\nHad I been invited to attend, I would have done so gladly. But if I were not invited, my joy would not be any less profound. Harriet and I would rejoice with our friends, our beloved brothers and sisters, from afar. We would praise God for this wonderful blessing just as enthusiastically from our home in Frankfurt as we would from Madrid.\nSons of Thunder\nAmong the Twelve whom Jesus called and ordained were two brothers, James and John. Do you remember the nickname He gave them?\nSons of Thunder (Boanerges).1\nYou don\u2019t get a nickname like that without an intriguing backstory. Unfortunately, the scriptures don\u2019t provide much explanation about the nickname\u2019s origin. However, we do get brief glimpses into the character of James and John. These were the same brothers who suggested calling down fire from heaven on a village in Samaria over not being invited into town.2\nJames and John were fishermen\u2014probably a little rough around the edges\u2014but I guess they knew a lot about the elements of nature. Certainly, they were men of action.\nOn one occasion, as the Savior prepared to make His final journey to Jerusalem, James and John approached Him with a special request\u2014one perhaps worthy of their nickname.\n\u201cWe want you to do for us whatever we ask,\u201d they said.\nI can imagine Jesus smiling at them as He responded, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cGrant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.\u201d\nThe Savior now challenged them to think a little more deeply about what they were asking and said, \u201cTo sit on\u00a0my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\u201d3\nIn other words, you can\u2019t get honor in the kingdom of heaven by campaigning for it. Nor can you \u201cpower lunch\u201d your way to eternal glory.\nWhen the other ten Apostles heard about this request from the Sons of Thunder, they weren\u2019t especially happy. Jesus knew His time was short, and seeing contention among those who would carry on His work must have troubled Him.\nHe talked to the Twelve\u00a0about the nature of power and how it affects those who seek and hold it. \u201cThe people of influence in the world,\u201d He said, \u201cuse their position of authority to exercise power over others.\u201d\nI can almost see the Savior, looking with infinite love into the faces of those faithful and believing disciples. I can almost hear His pleading voice: \u201cThis is not the way it shall be among you. Instead, whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.\u201d4\nIn God\u2019s kingdom, greatness and leadership means seeing others as they truly are\u2014as God sees them\u2014and then reaching out and ministering to them. It means rejoicing with those who are happy, weeping with those who grieve, lifting up those in distress, and loving our neighbor as Christ loves us. The Savior loves all of God\u2019s children regardless of their socioeconomic circumstance, race, religion, language, political orientation, nationality, or any other grouping. And so should we!\nGod\u2019s greatest reward goes to those who serve without expectation of reward. It goes to those who serve without fanfare; those who quietly go about seeking ways to help others; those who minister to others simply because they love God and God\u2019s children.5\nDon\u2019t Inhale\nShortly after my call as a new General Authority, I had the privilege to accompany President James\u00a0E. Faust for a stake reorganization. As I drove the car to our assignment in beautiful Southern Utah, President Faust was kind enough to use the time to instruct and teach me. One lesson I will never forget. Said he, \u201cThe members of the Church are gracious to the General Authorities. They will treat you kindly and say nice things about you.\u201d Then he briefly paused and said, \u201cDieter, always be thankful for this, but don\u2019t you ever inhale it.\u201d\nThis important lesson about Church service applies to every priesthood holder in every quorum of the Church. It applies to all of us in this Church.\nWhen President J.\u00a0Reuben Clark Jr. counseled those called to positions of authority in the Church, he would tell them not to forget rule number six.\nInevitably, the person would ask, \u201cWhat is rule number six?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take yourself too darn seriously,\u201d he would say.\nOf course, this led to a follow-up question: \u201cWhat are the other five rules?\u201d\nWith a twinkle in his eye, President Clark would say, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any.\u201d6\nTo be effective Church leaders, we must learn this critical lesson: leadership in the Church is not so much about directing others as it is about our willingness to be directed by God.\nCallings as Opportunities for Service\nAs Saints of the Most High God, we are to \u201cremember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.\u201d7 Opportunities to go about doing good and to serve others are limitless. We can find them in our communities, in our wards and branches, and certainly in our homes.\nIn addition, every member of the Church is given specific formal opportunities to serve. We refer to these opportunities as \u201ccallings\u201d\u2014a term that should remind us of who it is that calls us to serve. If we approach our callings as opportunities to serve God and minister to others with faith and humility, every act of service will be a step on the path of discipleship. In this way, God not only builds up His Church but also builds up His servants. The Church is designed to help us become true and faithful disciples of Christ, good and noble sons and daughters of God. This happens not just when we go to meetings and listen to talks but also when we get outside ourselves and serve. This is how we become \u201cgreat\u201d in the kingdom of God.\nWe accept callings with grace, humility, and gratitude. When we are released from these callings, we accept the change with the same grace, humility, and gratitude.\nIn the eyes of God, there is no calling in the kingdom that is more important than another. Our service\u2014whether great or small\u2014refines our spirits, opens the windows of heaven, and releases God\u2019s blessings not only upon those we serve but upon us as well. When we reach out to others, we can know with humble confidence that God acknowledges our service with approval and approbation. He smiles upon us as we offer these heartfelt acts of compassion, especially acts that are unseen and unnoticed by others.8\nEach time we give of ourselves to others, we take a step closer to becoming good and true disciples of the One who gave His all for us: our Savior.\nFrom Presiding to the Parade\nDuring the 150th anniversary of the pioneers\u2019 arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, Brother Myron Richins was serving as a stake president in Henefer, Utah. The celebration included a reenactment of the pioneers\u2019 passage through his town.\nPresident Richins was heavily involved with the plans for the celebration, and he attended many meetings with General Authorities and others to discuss the events. He was fully engaged.\nJust before the actual celebration, President Richins\u2019s stake was reorganized, and he was released as president. On a subsequent Sunday, he was attending his ward priesthood meeting when the leaders asked for volunteers to help with the celebration. President Richins, along with others, raised his hand and was given instructions to dress in work clothes and to bring his truck and a shovel.\nFinally, the morning of the big event came, and President Richins reported to volunteer duty.\nOnly a few weeks before, he had been an influential contributor to the planning and supervision of this major event. On that day, however, his job was to follow the horses in the parade and clean up after them.\nPresident Richins did so gladly and joyfully.\nHe understood that one kind of service is not above another.\nHe knew and put into practice the words of the Savior: \u201cHe that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\u201d9\nDoing Discipleship Right\nSometimes, like the Sons of Thunder, we desire positions of prominence. We strive for recognition. We seek to lead and to make a memorable contribution.\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to serve the Lord, but when we seek to gain influence in the Church for our own sake\u2014in order to receive the praise and admiration of men\u2014we have our reward. When we \u201cinhale\u201d the praise of others, that praise will be our compensation.\nWhat is the most important calling in the Church? It is the one you currently have. No matter how humble or prominent it may seem to be, the calling you have right now is the one that will allow you not only to lift others but also to become the man of God you were created to be.\nMy dear friends and brethren in the priesthood, lift where you stand!\nPaul taught the Philippians, \u201cInstead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity, each of you should, in humility, be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself.\u201d10\nServing with Honor\nSeeking honor and celebrity in the Church at the expense of true and humble service toward others is the trade of Esau.11\u00a0We may receive an earthly reward, but it comes at great cost\u2014the loss of heavenly approbation.\nLet us follow the example of our Savior, who was meek and lowly, who sought not the praise of men but to do the will of His Father.12\nLet us serve others humbly\u2014with energy, gratitude, and honor. Even though our acts of service may seem lowly, modest, or of little value, those who reach out in kindness and compassion to others will one day know the value of their service by the eternal and blessed grace of Almighty God.13\nMy dear brethren, dear friends, may we meditate upon, understand, and live this paramount lesson of Church leadership and priesthood governance: \u201cHe that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\u201d This is my prayer and blessing in the sacred name of our Master, our Redeemer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf\nThe Greatest among You\n2017\nGeneral Priesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nLaws and Ordinances\nPrepare to Teach\nThis lesson works much like lesson 4. The approach you take should be\ndetermined by the needs, interests, and situations of the people you are\nteaching and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about\nhow to help others live the gospel. Be mindful of the questions and level\nof understanding of those you teach. Ideas include:\nTeaching one or more of the laws and ordinances from this lesson\nwhile reviewing \u201cThe Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus\nChrist,\u201d \u201cThe Plan of Salvation,\u201d and \u201cThe Gospel of Jesus Christ\u201d\nlessons. For example, while teaching the message of the Restoration\nyou may want to teach about priesthood and missionary work; while\nteaching the plan of salvation you may teach about eternal marriage,\ntemples and family history service, and teaching and learning in the\nChurch. While teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ you may want to\nteach about the strait and narrow way and serving in the Church.\nTeaching two or three of the laws and ordinances as a single lesson.\nTeaching a single law or ordinance as a lesson.\nWork with members to help people you are teaching accept and begin\nliving these laws and ordinances. Help people recognize that by keeping\nGod\u2019s laws, they will retain a remission of their sins and stay on the\npathway to exaltation. They will experience greater peace and joy. They\nwill find answers to life\u2019s questions and security in the knowledge that\nthey belong to the true Church of Jesus Christ. The laws and ordinances\nserve as directions for living joyfully, with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm\nhope of receiving exaltation with our Father in Heaven.\nLearn about the Laws, Ordinances, and\nCommitments\nAs you study \u201cLaws and Ordinances,\u201d it is helpful to follow the pattern\nbelow.\nStudy the section that describes the doctrine, and write a simple lesson\nplan with three to five main points.\nTeach a two- or three-minute version to your companion. Practice how\nyou will extend each invitation and how you will resolve concerns.\nDiscuss effective ways to follow up on each commitment that people\nyou are teaching have accepted.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 1/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nPriesthood and Organizations\nPriesthood is the power and authority given to man to act in God\u2019s\nname for the salvation of His children. Priesthood power blesses all of us.\nThrough the priesthood, women and men receive the ordinances of\nsalvation, as well as the blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by Jesus Christ\nthrough apostles and prophets. These are righteous men who are called of\nGod and given the priesthood. Anciently Christ ordained His Apostles\nand gave them the priesthood. That authority was lost when the people\nrejected the gospel and killed Christ and the Apostles.\nPriesthood authority was restored in 1829 when John the Baptist\nappeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He laid his\nhands on their heads and conferred on them the Aaronic Priesthood (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 13). A short time later Peter, James, and John of\nthe original Twelve Apostles laid their hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver\nCowdery and conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, which\nPeter, James, and John had received from Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and\nCovenants 27:12\u201313).\nA man can receive priesthood authority only by proper ordination by\nthe laying on of hands by one who has the authority. A man who receives\nthe priesthood is given a marvelous opportunity. He enters a covenant to\nfulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church. He must\nhave a desire to serve God and must be ordained to this power (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 4:3; 63:57). It is also necessary for priesthood\nholders to perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation.\nWhen priesthood authority is used worthily, the power of God is\nmanifest. Priesthood power can be used only in righteousness, love, and\npatience.\nHow does this apply to women? President Dallin H. Oaks taught that\nwomen who are set apart as missionaries, officers, or teachers in the\nChurch are \u201cgiven priesthood authority to perform a priesthood\nfunction\u201d (\u201cThe Keys and Authority of the Priesthood,\u201d Ensign or Liahona,\nMay 2014, 51).\nAll priesthood comes from God. There are two priesthoods in the\nChurch: the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. The\nAaronic Priesthood administers ordinances such as baptism and the\nsacrament. Worthy males of the appropriate age receive the Aaronic\nPriesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.\nWorthy adult males will eventually receive the Melchizedek, or higher,\nPriesthood. Members of the Church receive many spiritual and temporal\nblessings through the power of this priesthood. Worthy Melchizedek\nPriesthood holders can confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordain others to\nthe priesthood as assigned, anoint the sick with consecrated oil, and give\nblessings of healing and comfort. Worthy husbands and fathers who hold\nthe Melchizedek Priesthood can give their spouses, children, and other\nfamily members special blessings. Ministering brothers care for\nindividuals and families in the households of Church members.\nMinistering sisters care for other women in the Church. Bishops and\nstake presidents are judges in the Church. They have the authority to\nhelp Saints who have sinned to repent and enjoy the full blessings of\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 2/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nChurch membership. They interview people to ensure their worthiness to\nenter the temple.\nIn an address to the Relief Society, President Joseph Fielding Smith\ntaught: \u201cWhile the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not\nbeen conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not\ngiven unto them authority. \u2026 A [man] may have authority given to him,\nor a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and\nabsolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters\ndo in the House of the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do\nsome great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just\nas thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the\nPriesthood\u201d (Joseph Fielding Smith, \u201cRelief Society\u2014an Aid to the\nPriesthood,\u201d Relief Society Magazine, Jan. 1959, 4).\nChurch organizations are organized by priesthood authority to assist in\nstrengthening members. Both men and women are a great resource in\nmissionary work as they assist in finding, teaching, and fellowshipping\nnew converts. The Relief Society, which includes women ages 18 and\nover, reaches out in service to families, individuals, and the community.\nYoung women ages 11 to 18 are members of the Young Women program.\nBoys of similar ages participate in the Young Men program. All children\nages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary organization. All members age 11 and\nolder are enrolled in Sunday School classes.\nScripture Study\nMosiah 18:17\nAlma 13:1\u201319\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 20:38\u201365\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 84:19\u201320 Doctrine and\nCovenants 121:34\u201346\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 107 Luke 9:1\u20136\nJohn 15:16\nJames 5:14\u201315\nInvitations\nWill you prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood?

As we share the gospel, we appreciate how\nprecious and meaningful it is to us, and we feel a greater love for God\nand others. The Lord commanded His followers to preach the gospel in\nall the world, giving every person the opportunity to accept or reject it.\nWhen people are baptized, they make a covenant to always stand as\nwitnesses of God. They are commanded to share the gospel with those\nwho have not yet received it. As they live the gospel faithfully, they will\nset an example, showing their family members and friends the great\nblessings that come from living the gospel. They should also take\nadvantage of opportunities to answer questions, share printed materials\nor digital media, and invite others to learn more about the message of the\nrestored gospel. Members should pray for those who are not members of\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 3/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nthe Church.

Within the family, people\nexperience many of life\u2019s greatest joys and sorrows. Marriage between a\nman and a woman is ordained of God and is central to God\u2019s eternal plan\nfor the salvation of His children. The means by which mortal life is\ncreated is divinely appointed and is safeguarded by marriage. The divine\nplan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the\ngrave. Marriage, however, can be eternal only when authorized\npriesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred temples and\nwhen husbands and wives who have been sealed together keep the\ncovenants they have made. Husbands and wives are to love each other.\nAs they keep the commandments and live gospel principles, they are to\nhonor their marital vows with complete fidelity (see \u201cThe Family: A\nProclamation to the World,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 145; see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:22).\nHappiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded\nupon the teachings of Jesus Christ and when parents make their family\ntheir highest priority. \u201cBy divine design, fathers are to preside over their\nfamilies in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the\nnecessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily\nresponsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred\nresponsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as\nequal partners\u201d (\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d 145).\nTogether, parents are to teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and\nhelp them live it.\nSatan is making a concentrated attack on families. Years ago Church\nleaders set aside one evening a week as a time for home evening. Parents\nshould use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen their\nrelationships with them, and have fun together. Other ways of\nstrengthening the family include daily family prayer and scripture study,\nworshipping at church as a family, doing family history, and serving\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 4/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nothers. Heaven is a continuation of the ideal family. Through priesthood\nordinances and righteous living, we can live as families in God\u2019s\npresence eternally.\nScripture Study\nMarriage\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 42:22 Doctrine and\nCovenants 131:1\u20134\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 49:15 Doctrine and\nCovenants 132:7\nEphesians 5:25\n\u201cThe Family: A\nProclamation to the\nWorld\u201d\nGenesis 2:24\nFamily\nMosiah 4:14\u201315\n1 Timothy 5:8 \u201cThe Family: A\nProclamation to the\nWorld\u201d\nAlma 56:47 Moses 6:55\u201362 Ephesians 6:4\nAlma 57:21 Doctrine and\nCovenants 68:25\u201330 Proverbs 22:6\n3 Nephi 18:21\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 130:2\nTeach Children\nInvitations\nWill you hold weekly home evening, daily family prayer, daily family\nscripture study, and other family activities?\nWill you prepare to enter the temple to (1) receive your endowment?\n(2) be married for time and eternity or, if married, be sealed for eternity\nas husband and wife? and (3) have your children sealed to you?\nWill you worship on the Sabbath as a family?\nWill you serve others?\nTemples and Family History\nGod has commanded His people to build temples. In the temple we\nmake sacred covenants and are endowed with, or are given, a gift of\npower and knowledge from on high. This power helps us in our daily\nlives and enables us to build God\u2019s kingdom. In the temple we can also\nbe married for time and eternity, thus making it possible for families to\nbe together forever in God\u2019s presence. After at least one year of\nmembership, worthy adults may be eligible to receive from their bishop a\nrecommend to receive their own endowment. After receiving their\nendowments, married couples may be sealed or married for eternity.\nThe Savior loves all people and desires their salvation. Yet millions of\npeople have died without having any opportunity to hear the message of\nthe restored gospel of Jesus Christ or receive saving ordinances. Through\nHis loving grace and mercy the Lord makes salvation possible for\neveryone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and\nobey the gospel during their mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these\ndeceased people in the spirit world. Members of the Church on earth\nperform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and\nothers. Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 5/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nto accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their\nbehalf.\nFor this reason, Church members search for information about their\nancestors. They can then add the information they find to the Church\u2019s\ndatabase at FamilySearch.org. A person can do so either on their own or\nwith the help of a temple and family history consultant. The Church\u2019s\ndatabase then allows Church members to share or print out and take to\nthe temple the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving\nordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples. This is an\nimportant aspect of doing family history. Worthy members of the\nappropriate age, including new members, are eligible to receive from\ntheir bishop a limited-use recommend to participate in performing\nbaptisms and confirmations for these deceased ancestors.\nFamily History\nWorking with the ward mission leader, introduce those you are teaching\nand new converts to another ward member who is familiar with temple and\nfamily history service (such as a temple and family history consultant). They\ncan help those people identify their deceased relatives who are in need of\ntemple ordinances. Where possible, go with new members to the temple.\nParticipate with them in performing temple ordinances.\nScripture Study\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 43:16 Doctrine and\nCovenants 128 Doctrine and\nCovenants 138\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 95:8\u20139 Doctrine and\nCovenants 131 1 Corinthians 15:29\nDoctrine and\nCovenants 124:22\u201342 Doctrine and\nCovenants 132 Psalm 65:4\n1 Peter 3:18\u201321\nInvitations\nWill you prepare to receive temple ordinances? (Soon after baptism and\nconfirmation, worthy members of the appropriate age can receive a\nrecommend to go to the temple and participate in baptisms for the\ndead.)\nWill you participate in family history work and submit the names of\ndeceased ancestors to receive temple ordinances?\nService\nOne of the great blessings of membership in the Church is the\nopportunity to serve. When we give loving service to others, we are\nserving God. When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service\n(see Mosiah 18:8\u201310). We are to become aware of others\u2019 physical and\nspiritual needs. We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet\nthose needs. We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve\nothers. We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him.\nSoon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the\nblessing of a responsibility to help in the Church. This is referred to as a\ncalling. All of the work in the Church is voluntary. No one is paid for\nsuch service. When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a\nChurch meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?la\u2026 6/84/8/23, 4:59 PM\nLesson 5: Laws and Ordinances\nprovide support. We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given\nspecial blessings to help us fulfill our callings. The Church needs the\ntalents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings. All\ncallings are important and help build God\u2019s kingdom. We are to accept\nsuch callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do\nso, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve,\nand receive numerous other blessings.\nSisters and priesthood holders may be given assignments to minister to\nothers. As members minister, they determine through communication\nand inspiration the frequency and type of contact they have with those to\nwhom they give care. Ministering brothers care for individuals and\nfamilies in households.

Hales\nStatistical Report, 2008\n2009\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Thank you, President Hinckley, for your great message. We are all profoundly grateful for your vigorous and inspired leadership in this difficult time. Under that leadership, we are going forward with the work of the Lord, so urgently needed in this troubled world.\nTo proclaim the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ is a fundamental principle of the Christian faith. Three of the gospel writers report this direction by the Savior.\nThe book of Mark records: \u201cAnd he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\n\u201cHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\u201d (Mark 16:15\u201316).\nMatthew quotes the Savior\u2019s command, \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Matt. 28:19).\nLuke states, \u201cThus it is written \u2026 that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations\u201d (Luke 24:46\u201347).\nApplying the Savior\u2019s directions to our day, modern prophets have challenged each of us to share the gospel.\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley has given the clarion call for our time. In a worldwide satellite address to missionaries and local leaders, he asked for \u201can infusion of enthusiasm\u201d for missionary work \u201cat every level in the Church\u201d (\u201cFind the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,\u201d Ensign, May 1999, 107). Though missionaries must continue their best efforts to find persons to teach, he declared that the \u201cbetter way \u2026 is through the members of the Church\u201d (105). He asked each of us to give our very best efforts to assisting missionaries in finding persons to teach. He also asked that each stake president and each bishop \u201caccept full responsibility and accountability for the finding and friendshipping of investigators\u201d within their units (107). President Hinckley also invoked the blessings of the Lord upon each of us \u201cin meeting the tremendous challenge that is ours\u201d (104).\nThough it has been two and a half years since our president made this plea, most of us have not yet acted effectively upon his challenge.\nAs I have prayerfully studied President Hinckley\u2019s words and pondered over how we can share the gospel, I have concluded that we need three things to fulfill our prophet\u2019s challenge. First, we need a sincere desire to share the gospel. Second, we need divine assistance. Third, we need to know what to do.\nI. Desire\nAs with so many other things, sharing the gospel begins with desire. If we are to become more effective instruments in the hands of the Lord in sharing His gospel, we must sincerely desire to do so. I believe we acquire this desire in two steps.\nFirst, we must have a firm testimony of the truth and importance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This includes the supreme value of God\u2019s plan for His children, the essential position of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in it, and the role of The Church of Jesus Christ in carrying out that plan in mortality.\nSecond, we must have a love for God and for all of His children. In modern revelation we are told that \u201clove, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify [us] for the work\u201d (D&C 4:5). The early Apostles of this dispensation were told that their love should \u201cabound unto all men\u201d (D&C 112:11).\nFrom our testimony of the truth and importance of the restored gospel, we understand the value of what we have been given. From our love of God and our fellowmen, we acquire our desire to share that great gift with everyone. The intensity of our desire to share the gospel is a great indicator of the extent of our personal conversion.\nThe Book of Mormon contains some marvelous examples of the effect of testimony and love. When the sons of Mosiah, who had been \u201cthe very vilest of sinners,\u201d acquired their testimony, \u201cthey were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish\u201d (Mosiah 28:3\u20134). In a later account, their associate, Alma, cried, \u201cO that I were an angel, \u2026 that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth\u201d and declare \u201cthe plan of redemption\u201d to every soul, \u201cthat there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth\u201d (Alma 29:1\u20132).\nI like to refer to missionary efforts as sharing the gospel. The word sharing affirms that we have something extraordinarily valuable and desire to give it to others for their benefit and blessing.\nThe most effective missionaries, member and full-time, always act out of love. I learned this lesson as a young man. I was assigned to visit a less-active member, a successful professional many years older than I. Looking back on my actions, I realize that I had very little loving concern for the man I visited. I acted out of duty, with a desire to report 100 percent on my home teaching. One evening, close to the end of a month, I phoned to ask if my companion and I could come right over and visit him. His chastening reply taught me an unforgettable lesson.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I want you to come over this evening,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve already dressed for bed. I am reading, and I am just not willing to be interrupted so that you can report 100 percent on your home teaching this month.\u201d That reply still stings me because I knew he had sensed my selfish motivation.\nI hope no person we approach with an invitation to hear the message of the restored gospel feels that we are acting out of any reason other than a genuine love for them and an unselfish desire to share something we know to be precious.\nIf we lack this love for others, we should pray for it. The prophet Mormon\u2019s writings about \u201cthe pure love of Christ\u201d teach us to \u201cpray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ\u201d (Moro. 7:47\u201348).\nII. Divine Assistance/Right Timing\nWe also need divine assistance to guide us in sharing the gospel. Just as our desires must be pure and rooted in testimony and love, our actions must be directed by the Lord. It is His work, not ours, and it must be done in His way and on His timing, not ours. Otherwise, our efforts may be fated to frustration and failure.\nAll of us have family members or friends who need the gospel but are not now interested. To be effective, our efforts with them must be directed by the Lord so that we act in the way and at the time when they will be most receptive. We must pray for the Lord\u2019s help and directions so we can be instruments in His hands for one who is now ready\u2014one He would have us help today. Then, we must be alert to hear and heed the promptings of His Spirit in how we proceed.\nThose promptings will come. We know from countless personal testimonies that in His own way and His own time the Lord is preparing persons to accept His gospel. Such persons are searching, and when we are seeking to identify them the Lord will answer their prayers through answering ours. He will prompt and guide those who desire and who sincerely seek guidance in how, where, when, and with whom to share His gospel. In this way, God grants unto us according to our desires (see Alma 29:4; D&C 6:8).\nIn modern revelation, the Lord has told us that \u201cthere are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded \u2026 and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it\u201d (D&C 123:12). When we are standing as \u201cwitnesses of God at all times and in all things\u201d (Mosiah 18:9), the Lord will open ways for us to find and have appropriate communications with those who are seeking. This will come when we seek direction and when we act out of a sincere and Christlike love for others.\nThe Lord loves all of His children. He desires that all have the fulness of His truth and the abundance of His blessings. He knows when they are ready, and He wants us to hear and heed His directions on sharing His gospel. When we do so, those who are prepared will respond to the message of Him who said, \u201cMy sheep hear my voice \u2026 and they follow me\u201d (John 10:27).\nIII. How to Do It\nWhen we have a sincere desire to share the gospel with others, and when we have sought divine assistance in our efforts, what should we do? How do we proceed? We begin by beginning. We should not wait for a further invitation from heaven. Revelation comes most often when we are on the move.\nThe Lord has given us this instruction as to who and how: \u201cAnd let your preaching be \u2026 every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness\u201d (D&C 38:41). \u201cNeighbors,\u201d of course, means not only those who live beside us and other friends and associates. When He was asked, \u201cWho is my neighbour?\u201d the Savior told of a Samaritan who recognized a neighbor on the road to Jericho (see Luke 10:25\u201337). Thus, our neighbors also include those we encounter in our daily travels.\nWe should pray, as Alma of old, for the Lord to give us \u201cpower and wisdom that we may bring\u201d our associates to the Lord (Alma 31:35). We also pray for the welfare of their souls (see Alma 6:6).\nWe must be sure we act out of love and not in any attempt to gain personal recognition or advantage. The warning against those who use Church position to gratify their pride or vain ambition (see D&C 121:37) surely applies to our efforts to share the gospel.\nThe need to act out of love also warns us against manipulation, real or perceived. People who do not share our belief can be repelled when they hear us refer to something as a \u201cmissionary tool.\u201d A \u201ctool\u201d is something used to manipulate an inanimate object. If we talk about something as a \u201cmissionary tool,\u201d we can convey the impression that we want to manipulate someone. That impression is entirely contrary to the unselfish, sharing spirit of our missionary service.\nIn his great message President Hinckley declares that \u201copportunities for sharing the gospel are everywhere\u201d (Ensign, May 1999, 106). He mentions many things we can do. We should live so that what he called \u201cthe tremendous power of the example of a member of the Church\u201d (104) will influence those around us. \u201cThe most effective tract we will carry,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be the goodness of our own lives and example\u201d (107). We must be sincerely friendly to all.\nPresident Hinckley reminded us that we can \u201cleave a piece of Church literature\u201d (106) with those with whom we come in contact. We can offer our homes \u201cto carry on this missionary service\u201d (105). The missionaries \u201cmay appropriately ask the members for referrals\u201d (107), and when they do, we should respond.\nIn summary, President Hinckley said every member of the Church can \u201cwork constantly at the task of finding and encouraging investigators\u201d (107).\nThere are other things we can do, especially as we act upon the prophet Mormon\u2019s great statement, \u201cI fear not what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear\u201d (Moro. 8:16; also see 1 Jn. 4:18). We can invite friends to Church meetings or Church-related activities. We can make appreciative references to our Church and the effect of its teachings and ask persons if they would like to know more.\nEven easier, we can carry a packet of these attractive pass-along cards and give them to persons\u2014even casual acquaintances\u2014with whom we come in contact in the daily activities of our lives. These cards are an ideal way to invite people to investigate the additional truths we have to share. In a nonintrusive way, they offer something precious, but the gift depends upon the choice and initiative of the potential recipient. In our experience, a significant fraction of those who telephone for the offered gift choose to have it delivered by those who can tell them more.\nThe Church has just announced another way to share the gospel, worldwide, on the Internet. In its potential, this new initiative is as exciting as the publishing of written tracts in the 19th century and our use of radio, television, and film in the 20th. The Church has activated a new Internet site to which we may refer persons interested in obtaining information about the Church and its doctrine and how they can find a place to worship with us. Its address is www.mormon.org. For missionaries, the value and use of this new resource will emerge with experience. For members of the Church, it will help us answer the questions of friends directly or by referring them to the site. It will also allow us to send our friends electronic greeting cards that include gospel messages and invitations.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe have been asked to redouble our efforts and our effectiveness in sharing the gospel, to accomplish the Lord\u2019s purposes in this great work. Until we do so, these wonderful full-time missionaries\u2014our sons and daughters and our noble associates in the Lord\u2019s work\u2014will remain underused in their great assignment to teach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWe have spoken about loving desire, heavenly guidance, and ways we can proceed with the divine command to share the gospel with our neighbors. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the brightest light and the only hope for this darkened world. \u201cWherefore,\u201d as Nephi teaches, \u201cwe must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men\u201d (2 Ne. 31:20).\nI testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, and of His desire that we join wholeheartedly in this, His work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDallin H. Oaks\nSharing the Gospel\n2001\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I add my word of welcome to all who are gathered in this great conference. It has veritably become a world conference. We now speak to congregations throughout North America and instantaneously reach to some across the seas. Hundreds of thousands are gathered this morning to hear the word of the Lord. I thank you for your faith and your desires, and seek the direction of the Holy Spirit.\nLet me tell you of an experience I had with one of our Area Presidents. We were in a land where, to our knowledge, there was not a member of the Church among the millions of that nation.\nThere was a man who knew of the Church and desired baptism. He had been a longtime student of the Bible. He belonged to a Christian church but was not satisfied. The thought came into his mind that he should belong to a church that carried the name of the Savior. In an old encyclopedia in a public library, he found listed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with headquarters in Salt Lake City. He wrote a letter of inquiry and received a response with literature. Other literature followed as he requested it.\nWhen we met him he had read the Book of Mormon again and again. He had read the Doctrine and Covenants and other Church writings. With enthusiasm he had told his friends of his treasured find. He asked to be baptized.\nWe questioned him. He knew of the priesthood, its orders and its offices. He knew of the various ordinances and the procedures of our meetings.\nDid he believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God? Oh, yes, he knew it to be true. He had read it. He had prayed about it and pondered. He had no doubt of its truth.\nDid he believe Joseph Smith to be a prophet of God? Most assuredly. Again, he had studied and prayed. He was convinced of the reality of that glorious vision when God the Eternal Father and His Beloved Son, the resurrected Lord, appeared to the boy Joseph to usher in a new and final dispensation of gospel truth.\nThe priesthood had been restored with all its gifts and powers. He knew that. Our friend asked for baptism and hoped for the priesthood that he might teach and act with proper authority.\n\u201cBut,\u201d we said, \u201cif we baptize you and then leave, you will be left alone. While there are many Christians in your nation, and freedom of religion is guaranteed under its laws, there are severe restrictions concerning foreigners. There will be no one to teach you and help you. There will be no one on whom you can lean.\u201d\nHe responded, \u201cGod will teach me and help me, and He will be my friend and support.\u201d\nI looked into the eyes of that good man and saw the light of faith. We baptized him under the authority of the holy priesthood. We confirmed him a member of the Church and bestowed upon him the Holy Ghost. We baptized his wife. We conferred upon him the Aaronic Priesthood and ordained him to the office of priest so that under proper direction they might have the sacrament.\nWe held a sacrament and testimony meeting with them. We embraced them and said good-bye to one another, and tears were in our eyes. They left to return to their home, and we left for responsibilities in other nations.\nI shall never forget him. He is poor in the things of the world. But he is educated\u2014a teacher by profession. I know little of his circumstances. But this I know\u2014when we talked with him, the fire of faith burned in his heart, and our own faith was quickened also.\nAs we traveled from that scene and there was time to meditate, I wished that faith of his kind was found more widely, both among us and among others. His example has provided a text for me. It is found in the fifth verse of the seventeenth chapter of Luke. Jesus had been teaching his disciples by precept and parable. \u201cAnd the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith\u201d (italics added).\nThis is my prayer for all of us\u2014\u201cLord, increase our faith.\u201d Increase our faith to bridge the chasms of uncertainty and doubt. As most of you know, in the last four or five years we have passed through an interesting episode in the history of the Church. There came into our hands two letters that were seized upon by the media when we announced them. They were trumpeted across much of the world as documents that would challenge the authenticity of the Church. In announcing them we stated that they really had nothing to do with the essentials of our history. But some few of little faith, who seemingly are always quick to believe the negative, accepted as fact the pronouncements and predictions of the media. I recall a letter from an individual who asked that his name be taken from the records of the Church because he could no longer believe in a church that had to do with an experience with a salamander.\nNow, as you know, these letters, together with other documents, have been acknowledged by their forger to be total frauds and part of an evil and devious design which culminated in the murder of two individuals.\nI have wondered what those whose faith was shaken have thought since the forger confessed to his evil work.\nHowever, I hasten to add, the vast majority of Church members, all but a very few, paid little attention and went forward with their faithful service, living by a conviction firmly grounded in that knowledge which comes by the power of the Holy Ghost. They knew then and they know now that God watches over this work, that Jesus Christ is the head of this Church, that it is true, and that happiness and growth come of following its precepts and teachings.\nOut of this earlier episode has now arisen another phenomenon. It is described as the writing of a \u201cnew history\u201d of the Church as distinguished from the \u201cold history.\u201d It represents, among other things, an effort to ferret out every element of folk magic and the occult in the environment in which Joseph Smith lived to explain what he did and why.\nI have no doubt there was folk magic practiced in those days. Without question there were superstitions and the superstitious. I suppose there was some of this in the days when the Savior walked the earth. There is even some in this age of so-called enlightenment. For instance, some hotels and business buildings skip the numbering of floor thirteen. Does this mean there is something wrong with the building? Of course not. Or with the builders? No.\nSimilarly, the fact that there were superstitions among the people in the days of Joseph Smith is no evidence whatever that the Church came of such superstition.\nJoseph Smith himself wrote or dictated his history. It is his testimony of what occurred, and he sealed that testimony with his life. It is written in language clear and plain and unmistakable. From an ancient record he translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. It is here for all to see and handle and read. Those who have read with faith and inquired in prayer have come to a certain knowledge that it is true. The present effort of trying to find some other explanation for the organization of the Church, for the origin of the Book of Mormon, and for the priesthood with its keys and powers will be similar to other anti-Mormon fads which have come and blossomed and faded. Truth will prevail. A knowledge of that truth comes by effort and study, yes. But it comes primarily as a gift from God to those who seek in faith.\nMy constant prayer in behalf of the entire Church is this: Lord, increase our faith to rise above the feeble detractors of this Thy great and holy work. Strengthen our will. Help us to build and expand Thy kingdom according to Thy great mandate, that this gospel may be preached in all the world as a witness unto all nations.\nI have seen answers to that prayer. I have seen the miracle of the expansion of this cause and kingdom and can testify of it.\nIn 1960, only twenty-seven years ago, I was given an assignment by the First Presidency to work with the mission presidents, the missionaries, and the Saints in Asia. The Church was weak and small in that part of the earth. The seed had been planted in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea by faithful Latter-day Saints in military service. But it was tiny and unstable. We had no buildings of our own. We met as small groups in rented houses. In winter they were cold and uncomfortable. Converts came into the Church. But some, lacking faith, soon left. However, there remained a residual of strong and wonderful men and women who looked beyond the adversity of the moment. They found their strength in the message, not in the facilities. They have remained faithful to this day, and their numbers have been added to by the tens and tens of thousands.\nA few Sundays back we held a regional conference in Tokyo. The spacious hall was filled to capacity. There were almost as many present on that occasion as there are assembled in the Salt Lake Tabernacle this morning. The Spirit of the Lord was there. An attitude of faith filled that vast congregation. For me, who had known those days when we were weak and few in number, it was a miracle to behold, for which I give thanks to the Lord.\nWe had a similar experience in Hong Kong, where there are now four stakes of Zion.\nThen in Seoul, Korea, my heart was touched as we entered the largest hall in that great city to find every seat taken by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and their invited guests. A magnificent choir of 320 voices opened with the strains \u201cOh, how lovely was the morning\u201d (\u201cJoseph Smith\u2019s First Prayer,\u201d Hymns, 1985, no. 26). It was a moving expression of the first vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nI had known South Korea in its days of poverty and reconstruction following the terrible war. When first I went there, we had six missionaries in Seoul and two in Pusan. Some were ill with hepatitis. Today there are four thriving missions in that land, with some six hundred missionaries. Many of the missionaries are sons and daughters of Korea. They include bright and beautiful young women in whose hearts burns the light of faith. They include young men who leave schooling for a season in order to serve missions. These young men are under tremendous pressures because of military requirements as well as educational demands, but they have faith in their hearts.\nWhen first I went to South Korea, there were two or three tiny branches. Today there are one hundred fifty local units of the Church, both wards and branches. Then it was a small, isolated district of the Northern Far East Mission. We had no chapels. Today there are 14 stakes with 47 chapels built and owned and another 52 under lease, with others under construction.\nI felt a spirit in that congregation three weeks ago that touched me to the depths of my soul. I saw the sweet fruits of faith. I knew of the early struggles in establishing an unknown church. I knew of the poverty of the people. Now there is strength. There is an undreamed-of measure of prosperity. There is a warm spirit of fellowship. There are families of devoted husbands and wives and good and beautiful children.\nThese are people I love, and I love them because of their faith. They are intelligent and well educated. They are hardworking and progressive. They are humble and prayerful. They are an example to others across the world.\nI say again, as did the Apostles to Jesus, \u201cLord, increase our faith.\u201d Grant us faith to look beyond the problems of the moment to the miracles of the future. Give us faith to pay our tithes and offerings and put our trust in Thee, the Almighty, to open the windows of heaven as Thou hast promised. Give us faith to do what is right and let the consequence follow.\nGrant us faith when storms of adversity beat us down and drive us to the ground. In seasons of sickness may our confidence wax strong in the powers of the priesthood. May we follow the counsel of James:\n\u201cIs any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:\n\u201cAnd the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up\u201d (James 5:14\u201315; italics added).\nHe who will follow me in speaking, President Howard W. Hunter, is a shining example of the efficacy of such faith.\nLord, when we walk in the valley of the shadow of death, give us faith to smile through our tears, knowing that it is all part of the eternal plan of a loving Father, that as we cross the threshold from this life we enter another more glorious, and that through the atonement of the Son of God all shall rise from the grave and the faithful shall go on to exaltation.\nGive us faith to pursue the work of redemption of the dead that Thine eternal purposes may be fulfilled in behalf of Thy sons and daughters of all generations.\nFather, grant us faith to follow counsel in the little things that can mean so very much. Our President, he whom we sustain as prophet, has repeatedly, since he was called to this responsibility, asked us to read that other great witness for the Lord Jesus Christ, the Book of Mormon. Tens of thousands have now done so to their great blessing. They could testify, Sweet are the rewards of simple faith.\nLord, increase our faith in one another, and in ourselves, and in our capacity to do good and great things.\nThis, my brothers and sisters, is my prayer.\nThere is a simple and moving story in the book of 1 Kings. Permit me to read you a few lines:\n\u201cAnd Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.\n\u201cAnd the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,\n\u201cGet thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.\n\u201cAnd it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.\n\u201cSo he [Elijah] went and did according unto the word of the Lord\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:1\u20135; italics added).\nThere was no argument. There was no discussion. There was no rationalizing on the part of Elijah. He simply \u201cwent and did.\u201d\nFather, increase our faith. Of all our needs, I think the greatest is an increase in faith. And so, dear Father, increase our faith in Thee, and in Thy Beloved Son, in Thy great eternal work, in ourselves as Thy children, and in our capacity to go and do according to Thy will, and Thy precepts, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon B. Hinckley\n\u201cLord, Increase Our Faith\u201d\n1987\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Thirty years ago this conference, I was called and sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. On that occasion I asked earnestly for your faith and your prayers. And today as my opportunity to speak to you has come, I renew that request, that I may have your faith and prayers.\nJust a month ago, while celebrating a national holiday, Elder Russell M. Nelson and I found ourselves with our children and grandchildren in a swimming pool filled with warm water and with a breathtaking view of an azure blue sky overhead. Mostly we were keeping a watchful eye on the little ones, much like a mother hen tracks the movement of her chicks. I said to Elder Nelson, \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting that even though parents are watching their children, we assume the need to give overall supervision of our respective flock of grandchildren.\u201d We had a wonderful time watching children at play and listening to their expressions of delight.\nThen I noticed among those in the pool a father holding his severely handicapped son, moving the boy\u2019s shrunken, tiny body back and forth in the pool. Other family members helped, and the lad obviously enjoyed the fun. He, however, was totally dependent. No sound of exuberant joy came forth from his lips, no splash of playful movement emanated from his almost lifeless limbs. Stricken as an infant with severe illness, he was left speechless, brain-damaged, and potentially a burden to loved ones. The boy\u2019s grandfather said to me, \u201cHe is my grandson. All in our family love him. We enjoy his company; we respond to his needs. He is a blessing in our lives.\u201d\nSoon the crowd began to leave the pool. Laughter and play ceased. A silence shrouded the scene as the afternoon sun began its descent and the chill air reminded me it was time to go. But this tender view of love and devotion remained with me.\nMy thoughts turned to a place far distant and to a time long ago\u2014even to another pool called Bethesda. The book of John describes what occurred there:\n\u201cNow there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.\n\u201cIn these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.\n\u201cFor an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.\n\u201cAnd a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.\n\u201cWhen Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?\n\u201cThe impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.\n\u201cJesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\n\u201cAnd immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.\u201d1\nAnother scene of suffering and sorrow is found in the famous Tate Gallery in London, England. There adorns the wall of a much-traveled corridor a masterpiece entitled Sickness and Health. The painting portrays an organ-grinder with his monkey and a group of happy, healthy children frolicking and showing their amusement at the monkey\u2019s antics. In the background is a small, pale-faced boy confined to a wheelchair, unable to play, unable to join in the fun of the other children. Feelings of empathy and silent tears of sadness overcome those who gaze upon the scene and sense the unspoken feelings of the sick boy\u2019s heart.\nWho can count the boys and girls, the men and women, where sickness has left its mark, rendering strong limbs lifeless and causing loved ones to shed tears of sorrow and offer prayers of faith for them?\nIllness is not the only culprit that intrudes and alters our lives. In our hectic and fast-moving world, accidents can in an instant inflict pain, destroy happiness, and curtail our future. Such was the experience of young Robert Hendricks. Healthy and carefree three years ago, a sudden, three-car accident left him with brain damage, limited use of his limbs, and impaired speech. Summoned to his side by his mother, who pleaded her despair, I gazed at his almost-lifeless form as he lay on the white hospital bed in the critical care unit. Life supports functioning, his head swathed in bandages, his future was not only in doubt, but death appeared certain.\nThe hoped-for miracle, however, did occur. Heavenly help was forthcoming. Robert lived. His recovery has been labored and slow\u2014but steady. A devoted friend, who was bishop at the time of the accident, has cared for Robert each week, getting him ready and driving him to his Sunday Church meetings\u2014always patient, ever faithful.\nOne day Robert\u2019s former bishop brought him to my office, since Robert wanted to meet with me, not having remembered that I saw him that night of crisis in the hospital. He and the dedicated bishop sat down, and Robert \u201ctalked\u201d with me through a small electronic machine on which he spelled out his thoughts and they were then printed on strips of paper. He spelled out on the machine the love he has for his mother, his thanks for helping hands and willing hearts which have aided him, and his gratitude to a kind and caring Heavenly Father who has sustained him through his prayers. Here are some of his less private and personal messages: \u201cI\u2019m coming along pretty good, considering what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d Another: \u201cI know that I will be able to help people and make some difference in people\u2019s lives, and that\u2019s great.\u201d Another: \u201cI don\u2019t really know just how fortunate I am, but in my prayers I am told to just keep pushing on.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of our visit, the bishop said, \u201cRobert would like to surprise you.\u201d Robert stood and, with considerable effort, said aloud, \u201cThank you.\u201d A broad smile crossed his face. He was on the way back. \u201cThanks be to God\u201d were the only words I could utter. Later I prayed aloud, \u201cThanks be also for loving bishops, kind teachers, and skilled specialists.\u201d\nToday, Robert, through the help of his former bishop, his current bishop, and others, has been to the temple. He has learned the computer. He is enrolled in computer study at college. He was also aided along the way by Deseret Industries helpers who provided encouragement and taught him essential skills. Now, with the support of a cane, Robert walks. He has learned to talk, though in halting phrases and with great effort. His progress has been phenomenal.\nAt times illness and accident take the lives of those whom they strike. Place and station, age and whereabouts make no difference. Death comes to the aged as they walk on faltering feet. Its summons is heard by those who have scarcely reached midway in life\u2019s journey, and often it hushes the laughter of little children.\nThroughout the world there is enacted daily the sorrowful scene of loved ones mourning as they bid farewell to a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, or a cherished friend.\nLet us look in on one such scene which took place just last month in the Sunset Gardens Cemetery. Gathered were friends and family of Roger S. Olson, whose casket, bedecked with flowers, contained his earthly body. Claudia, his wife, six precious children, and family, friends, and associates stood in silence.\nJust a few days earlier, Roger had left for his work, where he was a talented and recognized authority in his field of specialized photography. An accident resulted in the helicopter crash which took his life\u2014all in the twinkling of an eye and without advance warning. Filled with grief but comforted by faith, those who had loved and lived together had bid but a temporary farewell to husband and father. They are sustained by the knowledge the skeptic rejects. They treasure the account recorded in Luke which describes that most significant event following the crucifixion and burial of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ:\n\u201cNow upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, [Mary Magdalene and the other Mary] came unto the sepulchre.\u201d To their astonishment, the body of their Lord was gone. Luke records that two men in shining garments stood by them and said, \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.\u201d2\nAgainst the philosophy rampant in today\u2019s world\u2014a doubting of the authenticity of the Sermon on the Mount, an abandonment of Christ\u2019s teaching, a denial of God, and a rejection of His laws\u2014the Olsons and true believers everywhere treasure the testimonies of eyewitnesses to His resurrection. Stephen, doomed to the cruel death of a martyr, looked up to heaven and cried, \u201cBehold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.\u201d3\nSaul, on the road to Damascus, had a vision of the risen, exalted Christ. Peter and John also testified of the risen Christ. And in our dispensation, the Prophet Joseph Smith bore eloquent testimony of the Son of God, for he saw Him and heard the Father introduce him: \u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d4\nAs we ponder the events that can befall all of us\u2014even sickness, accident, death, and a host of lesser challenges, we can say, with Job of old, \u201cMan is born unto trouble.\u201d5 Needless to add, that reference to man in the King James Version of the book of Job encompasses women as well. It may be safely assumed that no person has ever lived entirely free of suffering and tribulation. Nor has there ever been a period in human history that did not have its full share of turmoil, ruin, and misery.\nWhen the pathway of life takes a cruel turn, there is the temptation to think or speak the phrase, \u201cWhy me?\u201d Self-incrimination is a common practice, even when we may have had no control over our difficulty. Socrates is quoted as saying: \u201cIf we were all to bring our misfortunes into a common store, so that each person should receive an equal share in the distribution, the majority would be glad to take up their own and depart.\u201d\nHowever, at times there appears to be no light at the tunnel\u2019s end\u2014no dawn to break the night\u2019s darkness. We feel surrounded by the pain of broken hearts, the disappointment of shattered dreams, and the despair of vanished hopes. We join in uttering the biblical plea, \u201cIs there no balm in Gilead?\u201d6 We are inclined to view our own personal misfortunes through the distorted prism of pessimism. We feel abandoned, heartbroken, alone.\nTo all who so despair, may I offer the assurance of the Psalmist\u2019s words: \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d7\nWhenever we are inclined to feel burdened down with the blows of life\u2019s fight, let us remember that others have passed the same way, have endured, and then have overcome.\nJob was a perfect and an upright man who \u201cfeared God, and eschewed evil.\u201d8 Pious in his conduct, prosperous in his fortune, Job was to face a test which would tempt any man. Shorn of his possessions, scorned by his friends, afflicted by his suffering, even tempted by his wife, Job was to declare from the depths of his noble soul, \u201cBehold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.\u201d9 \u201cI know that my redeemer liveth.\u201d10\nTurning to our own time, let me share with you an example of faith, of courage, of compassion, of victory. It illustrates how it is possible to meet life\u2019s challenges\u2014headon. It exemplifies the ability to suffer physical impairment, endure pain and suffering, and yet never complain. Such are Wendy Bennion of Sandy, Utah, and Jami Palmer of Park Valley, Utah. Both are teenagers; both have borne similar afflictions. Their situations run almost parallel. Since Wendy\u2019s battle has been of a longer duration, I shall speak today of her.\nStricken with cancer at a tender age, subjected to long periods of chemotherapy, Wendy persevered valiantly. Teachers cooperated, parents and family helped\u2014but the mainstay in her affliction has been her indomitable spirit. Wendy has brought cheer to others similarly afflicted. She has prayed for them; she has sustained them with her own example and faith.\nAfter completion of eighteen months of chemotherapy, a balloon-launching party was held in Wendy\u2019s honor. The public media covered the event. One of the many balloons launched that day was found miles away by Jayne Johnson. It had landed in her backyard, and she discovered it just as she was starting her own chemotherapy treatments. She wrote to Wendy, indicating she had been feeling sad and frightened but that finding the balloon and the note inside\u2014which told about Wendy, her cancer, and the completion of her treatments\u2014had given her the strength and that Wendy was a real inspiration to her. Wendy said, \u201cI think she was supposed to find that balloon so that she would know that it\u2019s not the end of the world and that people do get better.\u201d\nThough Wendy\u2019s cancer recurred, and a second round of therapy was needed, this choice young lady has not wavered, nor has she shrunk from her course. Rarely have I witnessed one with such courage, such determination, such faith. The same can be said of Jami Palmer. They personify the words of the poetess, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, who wrote:\nIt is easy enough to be pleasant,\nWhen life flows by like a song,\nBut the man worth while is one who will smile,\nWhen everything goes dead wrong.\nFor the test of the heart is trouble,\nAnd it always comes with the years,\nAnd the smile that is worth the praises of earth\nIs the smile that shines through tears.11\nThere is one life that sustains those who are troubled or beset with sorrow and grief\u2014even the Lord Jesus Christ. Foretelling His coming, the prophet Isaiah records: \u201cHe hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\n\u201cHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n\u201cSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\n\u201cBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\u201d12\nYes, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is our Exemplar and our strength. He is the light that shineth in darkness. He is the Good Shepherd. Though engaged in His majestic ministry, He embraced the opportunity to lift burdens, provide hope, mend bodies, and restore life.\nFew accounts of the Master\u2019s ministry touch me more than His example of compassion shown to the grieving widow at Nain: \u201cAnd it came to pass \u2026 that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.\n\u201cNow when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.\n\u201cAnd when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.\n\u201cAnd he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\n\u201cAnd he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.\u201d13\nWhat power, what tenderness, what compassion did our Master thus demonstrate! We, too, can bless if we will but follow His noble example. Opportunities are everywhere. Needed are eyes to see the pitiable plight and ears to hear the silent pleadings of a broken heart. Yes, and a soul filled with compassion, that we might communicate not only eye to eye or voice to ear but, in the majestic style of the Savior, even heart to heart.\nHis words become our guide: \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d14\nHe lives. He will sustain each of us. May we keep His commandments. May we ever follow Him and merit His companionship, that we may successfully meet and overcome life\u2019s challenges, I pray humbly, in His holy name, the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nMeeting Life\u2019s Challenges\n1993\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "When the Lord declared that \u201cpower is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable,\u201d He revealed that this period of childhood and unaccountability was given to children so that \u201cgreat things may be required at the hand of their fathers.\u201d (See D&C 29:47\u201348.)\n\u201cThat great things may be required at the hand of their fathers\u201d! What confidence the Lord has in fathers, and what a responsibility He has placed on fathers! Great things are required of fathers today.\nWhen I think of fathers, I think of Adam\u2014progenitor of us all\u2014who faithfully taught his posterity in the ways of righteousness. I think of father Abraham, whose faith knows no peer among mortal fathers. I esteem Jacob, or Israel, with a feeling akin to reverence for his diligence and long-suffering. I honor the name of Lehi for the example he gave to his sons.\nIn this dispensation, I think of Joseph Smith, Sr., first to give credence to his prophet-son\u2019s testimony. I think of the noble example of Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church and father of the tenth President.\nI revere these noble men\u2014not just because they were great prophets, but because they were great fathers, who realized what the Lord required of them, and they lived up to that expectation.\nI wish to speak on this occasion to you fathers about three particular things that the Lord requires of us. These are things that every father with an ordinary amount of diligence may do. If we will do them, our homes will be blessed with peace, our names will be proudly borne by our descendants, and our association with our family may be eternal.\nFathers, what great things does the Lord require of us?\nFirst, provide a home where love and the Spirit of the Lord may abide. Children are born innocent, not evil. They are not sent to earth, however, to neutral environments. They are sent to homes that, for good or evil, influence their ideas, emotions, thoughts, and standards, by which future choices will be made.\nOne great thing the Lord requires of each of us is to provide a home where a happy, positive influence for good exists. In future years the costliness of home furnishings or the number of bathrooms will not matter much, but what will matter significantly is whether our children felt love and acceptance in the home. It will greatly matter whether there was happiness and laughter, or bickering and contention.\nI am convinced that before a child can be influenced for good by his or her parents, there must be a demonstration of respect and love.\nPresident Joseph F. Smith said: \u201cFathers, if you wish your children to be taught in the principles of the gospel, \u2026 if you wish them to be obedient to and united with you, love them! and prove to them that you do love them by your every word or act to them. For your own sake, for the love that should exist between you and your boys\u2014however wayward they might be, \u2026 when you speak or talk to them, do it not in anger; do it not harshly, in a condemning spirit. Speak to them kindly; get down and weep with them, if necessary, and get them to shed tears with you if possible. Soften their hearts; get them to feel tenderly towards you. Use no lash and no violence, but \u2026 approach them with reason, with persuasion and love unfeigned. With this means, if you cannot gain your boys and your girls, \u2026 there will be no means left in the world by which you can win them to yourselves.\u201d (Liahona, The Elders\u2019 Journal, 17 Oct. 1911, pp. 260\u201361.)\nMany suggestions could be enumerated as to what we can and should do to make our homes places of refuge and happiness. I believe, however, that to tell a man what is expected of him is more important than to prescribe exactly how he is to get the job done.\nOnce you determine that a high priority in your life is to see that your wife and your children are happy, then you will do all in your power to do so. I am not just speaking of satisfying material desires, but of filling other vital needs such as appreciation, compliments, comforting, encouraging, listening, and giving love and affection.\nIf with pleasure you are viewing\nAnything your child is doing,\nIf you like him, if you love him,\nLet him know.\nDon\u2019t withhold appreciation\nUntil others give expression\u2014If he wins your commendation\nTell him so.\nMore than fame and more than money\nIs a disposition sunny,\nAnd some hearty warm approval\nMakes one glad.\nSo if you think some praise is due him,\nNow\u2019s the time to give it to him;\nTie him close with loving language\nFrom his dad.\nYour supreme opportunity in life is fatherhood! These words directed to fathers by President David O. McKay should be framed by every father:\n\u201cWhen one puts businesses or pleasure, or the earning of additional income, above his home, he that moment starts on the downgrade to soul weakness. When the club becomes more attractive to any man than his home, it is time for him to confess in bitter shame that he has failed to measure up to the supreme opportunity of his life, and flunked in the final test of true manhood.\n\u201cThe poorest shack in which love prevails over a united family is of far greater value to God and future humanity than any other riches. In such a home God can work miracles, and will work miracles. Pure hearts in a pure home are always in whispering distance of Heaven.\u201d (Church News, 7 Sept. 1968, p. 4.)\nFathers, what is the spirit in your homes?\nSecond, teach your children to understand principles of truth. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph, the Lord directed fathers to bring up their children in light and truth. He rebuked several because of their failure to do so. Each of us would do well to review those principles given in section 93 to Joseph Smith, Jr., Frederick G. Williams, Sidney Rigdon, and Newel K. Whitney.\nIn this revelation the Lord states that Satan \u201ccometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.\u201d (D&C 93:39.) The \u201ctradition of their fathers\u201d refers, of course, to the bad examples and teachings of fathers.\nWe must remember this world is a telestial environment. Our children grow up in this environment. They are constantly exposed to television programs and movie entertainment which depict the most seamy and perverse side of life. They are barraged with slogans and advertising designed to induce them to practices that rob them of spirituality. Even some textbooks and teaching aids used in our public school systems present theory and, in some instances, falsehood as truth.\nSome fathers leave solely to the mother or to the school the responsibility of shaping a child\u2019s ideas and standards. Too often television and movie screens shape our children\u2019s values.\nWe should not assume that public schools always reinforce teachings given in the home concerning ethical and moral conduct. We have seen introduced into many school systems false ideas about the theory of man\u2019s development from lower forms of life, teachings that there are no absolute moral values, repudiation of all beliefs regarded as supernatural, permissiveness about sexual freedom that gives sanction to immoral behavior and \u201calternative life-styles\u201d such as lesbianism, homosexuality, and other perverse practices.\nSuch teachings not only tend to undermine the faith and morals of our young people, but they deny the existence of God, who gave absolute laws, and the divinity of Jesus Christ. Surely we can see the moral contradiction of some who argue for the preservation of endangered species, but sanction the abortion of unborn humans.\nThere is a solution, and it is that the Lord expects great things from the fathers of Israel. Fathers must take time to find out what their children are being taught and then take steps to correct false information and teaching.\nI know fathers who inquire of their children each evening to determine firsthand what their children are being taught in school and what needs to be corrected. Then, if necessary, they instruct them in what the Lord has revealed. This is application of the principle that \u201clight and truth forsake that evil one.\u201d (D&C 93:37.)\nThe new consolidated Sunday meeting schedule has been implemented to give fathers more time on the Sabbath to teach their children. This is a golden opportunity for families to study the scriptures and receive instruction from their parents. Blessed is the household that does this on a consistent basis.\nWhat should we teach? The Lord has revealed the specific curriculum that parents should teach. Hear His words: \u201cTeach \u2026 unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence.\u201d (Moses 6:57.)\nAs further noted in this revelation, the fundamental doctrines consist of the doctrine of the Fall, the mission of Christ and His atonement, and the first principles and ordinances of the gospel, which include faith in Christ, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost as the means to a sanctified life (see Moses 6:58\u201359).\nBrethren, we are to teach the fundamental doctrines of the Church in such a way that our children may understand. Some fathers teach, but their children do not understand. This places responsibility on fathers to study and learn the gospel.\nWith few exceptions, righteous sons and daughters who have attained eternal blessings are not just physically begotten by their fathers. They are spiritually regenerated by the examples and teachings of their fathers.\nGreat fathers lead their children to Christ.\nThird, set in order your own household. Such was the Lord\u2019s counsel to fathers in early Church history, and such is His timely counsel to us today!\nSetting your home in order is keeping the commandments of God. This brings harmony and love in the home between you and your companion and between you and your children. It is daily family prayer. It is teaching your family to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is each family member keeping the commandments of God. It is you and your companion being worthy to receive a temple recommend, all family members receiving the ordinances of exaltation, and your family being sealed together for eternity. It is being free from excessive debt, with family members paying honest tithes and offerings.\nFathers, are your homes in order?\nIn a revelation given to President John Taylor, the Lord directed this message to the priesthood: \u201cI call upon the heads of families to put their houses in order according to the law of God, \u2026 and to purify themselves before me, and to purge out iniquity from their households. And I will bless and be with you, saith the Lord, and ye shall gather together in your holy places wherein ye assemble to call upon me, and ye shall ask for such things as are right, and I will hear your prayers, and my Spirit and power shall be with you, and my blessing shall rest upon you, upon your families, your dwellings and your households, upon your flocks and herds and fields, your orchards and vineyards, and upon all that pertains to you; and you shall be my people and I will be your God; \u2026 for my word shall go forth, and my work shall be accomplished, and my Zion shall be established.\u201d (Revelation given through President John Taylor, at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, October 13th, 1882, typeset ms. in Church Historical Department Archives, pp. 2\u20133.)\nYes, these times require great things from fathers, and so does the Lord. Three requirements are: create a home where love and the Spirit of the Lord may abide; bring up children in light and truth; and set your homes in order.\nThe sacred title of \u201cfather\u201d is shared with the Almighty. In the Church men are called and released. Did you ever hear of a mortal father being released?\nAs I travel throughout the Church and see faithful families, I say, \u201cThank God for exemplary fathers and mothers.\u201d As I see faithful young people and am proud of their accomplishments, I say, \u201cThank God for diligent fathers and mothers.\u201d\nFatherhood is not a matter of station or wealth; it is a matter of desire, diligence, and determination to see one\u2019s family exalted in the celestial kingdom. If that prize is lost, nothing else really matters.\nI know of one family who has as its goal that each member of the family and posterity will arrive in their heavenly home\u2014the celestial kingdom\u2014with no vacant chairs. That is their objective. They review it at every family reunion and mention it frequently as they mingle together between reunions.\nGod bless all the fathers in Israel to do well the work within the walls of our own homes. With the Lord\u2019s help we shall succeed in this, our most important responsibility. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nEzra Taft Benson\nGreat Things Required of Their Fathers\n1981\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "My testimony today is one of gratitude.\nAt a family gathering a few nights ago, we discussed the fact that today is the anniversary of our mother\u2019s birth.\nI thought that night how much the generations owe each other, how much we learn from each other, how we should love and appreciate each other. One of mother\u2019s grandsons said he had watched with wonderment as his tiny daughter paged through her storybook, moistening her first finger to turn the pages as she had seen her daddy do as he read his books. Actually, she was moistening the finger on her left hand and turning the pages with the finger on her right hand! But that only served to emphasize both the power of example and the fact that she, like all the rest of us, is yet learning.\nAs I observed two of our lovely grown daughters that night an incident from the past came to mind that forms the burden of my brief message today. I still think of it with a tendency to tears. Another little girl had joined our family and was of course much loved. Occasionally I had called her older sister \u201cPrincess,\u201d but had thought about that, and, since the second young lady was equally deserving of royal treatment, had concluded that it would be well for her to share the title, if it were used at all.\nSo one day I called to her, \u201cCome on, Princess. Let\u2019s go to the store for mother.\u201d She seemed not to hear. \u201cHoney,\u201d her mother said, \u201cdaddy is calling you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she answered, with a quiet sadness that hurt my heart, \u201che doesn\u2019t mean me.\u201d\nIn memory I can still see the resignation on her innocent child face and hear it in her voice, when she thought that her father didn\u2019t mean her.\nI am one who believes that God loves and will never cease to love all of his children, and that he will not cease to hope for us or reach for us or wait for us. In Isaiah it is written:\n\u201cAnd therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you\u201d (Isa. 30:18).\nAnd yet over the earth, across the years, I have met some of God\u2019s choicest children who find it very difficult to believe in their hearts that he really means them. They know that he is the source of comfort and pardon and peace and that they must seek him and open the door for him and accept his love, and yet even in their extremity they find it difficult to believe that his promised blessings are for them. Some have offended God and their own consciences and are earnestly repentant but they find the way back blocked by their unwillingness to forgive themselves or to believe that God will forgive them, or sometimes by a strange reluctance in some of us to really forgive, to really forget, and to really rejoice.\nThe plan of the Lord and his promises are clear in the teachings of the scriptures. The heart of that plan, as I understand it, is announced in verses of scripture which were so movingly sung by the choir this morning:\n\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\u201cFor God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\u201d (John 3:16\u201317.)\nChrist came to save us. His plan was called, by a prophet who understood it very well, a \u201cplan of redemption,\u201d a \u201cplan of mercy,\u201d a \u201cplan of happiness\u201d (Alma 42:13, 15\u201316). The Lord taught the letter-bound Pharisees the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son to impress the worth of all of God\u2019s children, to emphasize, as he said, the \u201cjoy [that] shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.\u201d And to teach us the nature of a father who, when his son came to himself and started home, had compassion and ran to meet his boy. (Luke 15:3\u201332; italics added). In this and many others of his teachings, he manifested the intensity of his love and of his expectations of us in our treatment of each other and in our responsibility to him.\nReverently I remind you of the incident of the woman who, in the home of the Pharisee, Simon, washed the feet of the Lord with her tears and dried them with her hair, and anointed them with ointment (see Luke 7:37\u201339). The Savior taught the critical Simon the story of the creditor and the two debtors: \u201cThe one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.\n\u201cAnd when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?\n\u201cSimon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.\u201d (Luke 7:41\u201343.)\nThen, speaking of the woman, he said: \u201cHer sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\n\u201cAnd he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.\n\u201c\u2026 Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.\u201d (Luke 7:47\u201348, 50.)\nThere is here, of course, no encouragement or condoning of sin. She had been converted by the Lord and sorely repented, and would obey his commandments and accept his forgiveness. And there would be rejoicing in heaven and should be on earth.\nThe story of Alma, the Book of Mormon prophet, was discussed yesterday and is well known. He taught these principles with courage and compassion perhaps never excelled. Himself the son of the great prophet, he and other youthful companions were guilty of serious sins. Through angelic intervention, they were turned to a better way; and Alma, repentant and restored, became a strong leader for the Lord. \u201cWickedness never was happiness\u201d\u2014he declared, and gratefully testified also of the \u201cplan of mercy\u201d that brings forgiveness to the truly penitent (Alma 42:10, 15). As the leader of his people he was uncompromising in defense of righteousness, and warm and compassionate with those who had repented and turned from unrighteousness. With his own children, including one son who had been guilty of serious moral error, he shared the anguish that follows transgression and the unspeakable joy that accompanies repentance and forgiveness:\n\u201cYea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.\u201d (Alma 36:21.)\nThis man of great integrity and no pretense became the first chief judge of the people and high priest over the church. He who had cried out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, \u201cin the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; \u2026 did find peace to [his] soul\u201d (Alma 38:8) and thereafter taught the people with such power and love that multitudes of them turned to the Lord, obeyed his commandments, received that \u201cmercy [which] claimeth the penitent\u201d (Alma 42:23).\nThe message is consistent through scripture. The noble young prophet-leader Nephi wrote the sweet psalm of contrition and faith that is so encouraging and edifying and can be read in the fourth chapter of the second book of Nephi: \u201cNotwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.\n\u201cI am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.\n\u201cAnd when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.\u201d (2 Ne. 4:17\u201319.)\nNephi understood that true remorse is a gift from God, not a curse, but a blessing. True remorse involves sorrow and suffering; but the sorrow is purposeful, constructive, cleansing, the \u201cgodly sorrow\u201d that \u201cworketh repentance to salvation,\u201d and not the \u201csorrow of the world\u201d (2 Cor. 7:10).\nThrough the prophet Ezekiel, the Lord taught us that he has no \u201cpleasure at all\u201d in the suffering of his children through sin. His joy comes when the sinner \u201cturneth away from all his transgressions\u201d for such an one shall \u201csave his soul\u201d (Ezek. 18:23, 27\u201328).\nThe Apostle Paul was disappointed with certain behavior on the part of the Corinthian saints, and wrote them a letter chastising them. They repented; and when he learned of it, he wrote them again, saying that he was comforted in their comfort: \u201cI rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance\u201d (2 Cor. 7:9).\nAlma summed it all up in magnificent instruction given his wayward son Corianton. He concluded that powerful lesson with these significant words\u2014they could be saving words for some:\n\u201cAnd now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance\u201d (Alma 42:29).\nAlmighty God has promised to forgive, forget, and never mention the sins of which we have truly repented. But he has given us the gift of remorse to help us remember them constructively, thankfully, and humbly: \u201cDo not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility\u201d (Alma 42:30).\nCorianton was sent to preach the word.\nAs leaders, we deal with the most sacred and sensitive creation of God\u2014his children.\nWe need to consider this as we carry out our duty to keep the Church free from iniquity.\n\u201cHolocausts,\u201d it has been written, \u201care caused not only by atomic explosion. A holocaust occurs whenever a person is put to shame.\u201d (Abraham Joshua Heschel.)\nIt is good to remember what Joseph Smith wrote a long time ago to the Saints scattered abroad:\n\u201cLet everyone labor to prepare himself for the vineyard, sparing a little time to comfort the mourners; to bind up the broken-hearted; to reclaim the backslider; to bring back the wanderer; to re-invite into the kingdom such as have been cut off, by encouraging them to lay to while the day lasts, and work righteousness, and, with one heart and one mind, prepare to help redeem Zion, that goodly land of promise, where the willing and obedient shall be blessed. Souls are as precious in the sight of God as they ever were; and the Elders were never called to drive any down to hell, but to persuade and invite all men everywhere to repent, that they may become the heirs of salvation.\u201d (History of the Church, 2:229.)\nMy child at first did not understand that my invitation was meant for her. She thought it was for someone else. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean me.\u201d If any within the sound of my voice today need assurance that God\u2019s call to repentance and his invitation to mercy and forgiveness and love is for them, I bear you that solemn witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarion\u00a0D. Hanks\nHe Means Me\n1979\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I feel confident, brothers and sisters, that we are most grateful for the splendid and timely message given by President Lee in this morning\u2019s session of conference. He gave encouragement and counsel for all of us to walk uprightly before the Lord and to keep his laws and commandments. It is the only way we can find our way to the eternal life that God has held out to the faithful of his people. In fact, our God gave this promise: \u201c\u2026 if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\u201d (D&C 14:7.)\n\u201cBehold, he that hath eternal life is rich.\u201d (D&C 6:7.) Very few people give enough thought to eternal life. Yet it is something each of us should keep uppermost in our minds and hearts. As children of God, we cannot afford to forget our origin and destiny if we desire the realms of celestial glory.\nThrough revelation, God has given the gospel plan of salvation and exaltation for men to live by. Eternal life is God\u2019s life, which he hopes to share with all his children. But we are free to act for ourselves, \u201c\u2026 to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\u201d (2 Ne. 2:27.)\nThe first step on the path to eternal life is baptism. Our Savior set the example when he went into the water with John the Baptist, who was authorized of God to baptize Jesus by immersion. This sets the mode of baptism for all men to follow.\nThe apostle Paul taught that there is \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism.\u201d (Eph. 4:5.)\nChrist is the one Lord, the gospel plan taught by him is the one faith, and his baptism by immersion is the one baptism.\nNephi, a Book of Mormon prophet, stated it this way: \u201c\u2026 For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.\n\u201cAnd then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life. \u2026\u201d (2 Ne. 31:17\u201318.)\n\u201cEnter ye in at the strait gate: \u2026\u201d said our Lord, \u201cbecause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\u201d (Matt. 7:13\u201314.)\nChrist made this positive statement: \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d (John 14:6.) If we believe in Christ and his mission, we cannot bypass him and obtain eternal life. The Savior gave his life as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world, thus opening the door for man who, through faithfulness, may gain eternal life and exaltation.\nHowever, conversion and baptism alone are not sufficient to one\u2019s assurance of eternal life. To receive exaltation in the kingdom of God, a person must abide the fulness of celestial law. (See D&C 76:50\u201370.)\nSome people erroneously think if they receive all the ordinances of the gospel, regardless of their transgressions, they will inherit the celestial mansions of our God. What a rude awakening awaits such false-thinking individuals, \u201c\u2026 for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\u201d (Alma 45:16.)\nListen to the teachings of Nephi on this subject: \u201cYea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.\n\u201cAnd there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God\u2014he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.\n\u201cYea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.\u201d (2 Ne. 28:7\u20139.)\nWe must not fall to the misleading precepts of man and foolishly break God\u2019s laws and thus lose our opportunity for exaltation. Jesus stated:\n\u201cNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 7:21.)\nA person earnestly seeking eternal life must avoid the pitfalls of temptation and sin. He is never safe from committing sin unless he has fully prepared himself and decided on the course he will take before temptation comes into his life.\nThere are two great opposite forces at work in the world. One is the force of evil which takes away man\u2019s agency, destroys freedoms, and makes the nonvaliant a follower of Satan; which can only lead to unhappiness in life and eternal misery. The second is the force of God. This is the power to do good; to live righteously, to enjoy freedom of choice, and to be courageous, faithful followers of Christ through whom only is salvation and exaltation assured.\nWe should determine whose side we are on and then have the courage, in spite of evil persuasion, to faithfully stay on the Lord\u2019s side.\nWe cannot mix evil with good and attain the eternal mansions of our Heavenly Father. Our duty is to constantly do the works of righteousness. The Lord has said that light and truth, which is the word of God, forsake the evil one. (See D&C 93:37.) Without light and truth in our lives, we are subject to the powers of Satan.\nWe must be ever aware of the deceiving servants of the Satanic hosts. The stratagems of Satan are many to entrap mankind in his powerful clutches. Some of the more obvious ones are apathy, complacency, immorality, drugs, greed for money, dishonesty, and corruptive practices.\nThe Savior taught his disciples: \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d (Matt. 6:24.)\nThis can be stated another way: You cannot serve both God and Satan. Life is a real challenge, but blessed with God-given powers, we can overcome every stratagem and obstacle Satan may place in our path. The path to eternal life may not be an easy one to follow with all the worldly enticements about us, but when we consider the rewards and blessings we gather if we travel the narrow way, it is worth every sacrifice we make.\nAlma taught his people that this life is the time for men to perform their labors and to prepare for eternity. He warned those who procrastinate their repentance: \u201cYe cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.\n\u201cFor behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, \u2026 therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you. \u2026\u201d (Alma 34:34\u201335.)\nWe need the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit. Without it we are deprived of its spiritual guidance and lose our sense of eternal values and drift further into disbelief and evil practices.\nThe Lord is displeased with those who do not forsake their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, their covetousness, and all their detestable things, which keep them from the eternal life he has offered unto them. (See D&C 98:20.)\n\u201cBut this much I can tell you,\u201d said King Benjamin to his people, \u201cthat if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith \u2026 even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.\u201d (Mosiah 4:30.)\nThe invitation for eternal life is open to all who are willing to pay the price. The Lord has said: \u201cYea, blessed are they \u2026 who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, \u2026 and \u2026 shall also be crowned with the blessings from above \u2026 they that are faithful and diligent before me.\u201d (D&C 59:3\u20134.)\nEntering into sacred covenants and obligations with God is not all that is required. Nephi stated: \u201cAnd now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\n\u201cWherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.\u201d (2 Ne. 31:19\u201320.)\nWe cannot stand idly by, being merely an interested spectator, rather than a participating member, and still receive the blessing of eternal life. It is our duty to gain an appropriate witness and testimony which will change and improve our lives for good.\nThe gift of eternal life cannot be obtained outside of the Church established by the Father and the Son. The church set up by Christ in the meridian of time became apostate following the ministry of his apostles, and thus was steeped in error by false gospel teachings, changing ordinances, and loss of divine authority. The same condition prevailed during the dark ages, requiring a new gospel dispensation\u2014the restoration of Christ\u2019s church to earth. I testify this restoration occurred in the year 1830, through the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands firmly on divine principles of eternal truth. It is meeting the temporal and spiritual needs of its members. It is not liberalizing its standards nor the teachings of Christ. Mormonism is growing because of its disciplines. The old-fashioned virtues of honesty, integrity, morality, and fidelity are God-given standards to live by. Unfortunately, these qualities are fast disappearing in the world, and wickedness is rising.\nI bear witness there is a future life that holds much in promise for the faithful of God\u2019s children. It is time for all men to turn fully to God. Our trust and faith in him assures his protective care and guiding influence which will lead us, if faithful and true, to his holy presence.\nI hope, brothers and sisters we will all be worthy of this wonderful gift and blessing. I know God lives. I know this is his church. I know it is directed by divine inspiration. We are most blessed in having a living prophet in our beloved Harold B. Lee. He is a great individual and one whom we can admire, respect, and look up to for teaching, counsel, and guidance. May God bless us to be faithful and true to all the covenants and obligations we have entered into with him, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nDelbert L. Stapley\nThe Path to Eternal Life\n1973\nFriday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "In the spring of 1998, Carol and I were able to combine a business trip with a family vacation and bring our four children, along with my recently widowed mother-in-law, to Hawaii for a few days.\nThe night before our flight to Hawaii, our four-month-old son, Jonathon, was diagnosed with a double ear infection, and we were told that he could not travel for at least three to four days. The decision was made for Carol to stay home with Jonathon, while I would make the trip with the rest of the family.\nMy first indication that this was not the trip I had envisioned occurred soon after our arrival. Walking down a moonlit, palm-lined path, with a view of the ocean in front of us, I turned to comment on the beauty of the island, and in that romantic moment, rather than seeing Carol, I found myself looking into the eyes of my mother-in-law\u2014whom, I may add, I love dearly. It just wasn\u2019t what I had anticipated. Nor had Carol expected to spend her vacation at home alone with our sick infant son.\nThere will be times in our lives when we find ourselves on an unexpected path, facing circumstances much more severe than a disrupted vacation. How do we respond when events, often out of our control, alter the life we had planned or hoped for?\nOn June\u00a06, 1944, Hyrum Shumway, a young second lieutenant in the United States\u00a0Army, went ashore at Omaha Beach as part of the D-day invasion. He made it safely through the landing, but on July\u00a027, as part of the Allied advance, he was severely injured by an exploding anti-tank mine. In an instant, his life and future medical career had been dramatically impacted. Following multiple surgeries, which helped him recover from most of his serious injuries, Brother Shumway never did regain his sight. How would he respond?\nFollowing three years in a rehabilitation hospital, he returned home to Lovell, Wyoming. He knew that his dream of becoming a medical doctor was no longer possible, but he was determined to move ahead, get married, and support a family.\nHe eventually found work in Baltimore, Maryland, as a rehab counselor and employment specialist for the blind. In his own rehabilitation process, he had learned that the blind are capable of much more than he had realized, and during his eight years in this position, he placed more blind people into employment than any other counselor in the nation.\nNow confident in his ability to provide for a family, Hyrum proposed to his sweetheart by telling her, \u201cIf you will read the mail, sort the socks, and drive the car, I can do the rest.\u201d They were soon sealed in the Salt Lake Temple and ultimately blessed with eight children.\nIn 1954 the Shumways returned to Wyoming, where Brother Shumway worked for 32 years as the State Director of Education for the Deaf and Blind. During that time, he served for seven years as bishop of the Cheyenne First Ward and, later, 17 years as stake patriarch. Following his retirement, Brother and Sister Shumway also served as a senior couple in the London England South Mission.\nHyrum Shumway passed away in March 2011, leaving behind a legacy of faith and trust in the Lord, even under trying conditions, to\u00a0his large posterity of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.1\nHyrum Shumway\u2019s life may have been changed by war, but he never doubted his divine nature and eternal potential. Like him, we are spirit sons and daughters of God, and we \u201caccepted His plan by which [we] could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.\u201d2 No amount of change, trial, or opposition can alter that eternal course\u2014only our choices, as we exercise our agency.\nThe changes, and resulting challenges, that we encounter in mortality come in a variety of shapes and sizes and impact each of us in unique ways. Like you, I have witnessed friends and family face challenges caused by:\nThe death of a loved one.\nA bitter divorce.\nPerhaps never having the opportunity to marry.\nA serious illness or injury.\nAnd even natural disasters, as we have recently witnessed around the world.\nAnd the list goes on. Although each \u201cchange\u201d may be unique to our individual circumstances, there is a common element in the resulting trial or challenge\u2014hope and peace are always available through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The Atonement of Jesus Christ provides the ultimate corrective and healing measures to every wounded body, damaged spirit, and broken heart.\nHe knows, in a way that no one else can understand, what it is that we need, individually, in order to move forward in the midst of change. Unlike friends and loved ones, the Savior not only sympathizes with us, but He can empathize perfectly because He has been where we are. In addition to paying the price and suffering for our sins, Jesus Christ also walked every path, dealt with every challenge, faced every hurt\u2014physical, emotional, or spiritual\u2014that we will ever encounter in mortality.\nPresident Boyd\u00a0K. Packer taught: \u201cThe mercy and grace of Jesus Christ are not limited to those who commit sins \u2026\u00a0, but they encompass the promise of everlasting peace to all who will accept and follow Him. \u2026 His mercy is the mighty healer, even to the wounded innocent.\u201d3\nIn this mortal experience, we cannot control all that happens to us, but we have absolute control over how we respond to the changes in our lives. This does not imply that the challenges and trials we face are of no consequence and easily handled or dealt with. It does not imply that we will be free from pain or heartache. But it does mean that there is cause for hope and that due to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can move forward and find better days\u2014even days full of joy, light, and happiness.\nIn Mosiah we read the account of Alma, the ex-priest of King Noah, and his people, who, \u201chaving been warned of the Lord \u2026\u00a0[,] departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.\u201d After eight days, \u201cthey came to \u2026 a very beautiful and pleasant land\u201d where \u201cthey pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings.\u201d4\nTheir situation looked promising. They had accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ. They had been baptized as a covenant that they would serve the Lord and keep His commandments. And \u201cthey did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land.\u201d5\nHowever, their circumstances would soon change. \u201cAn army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.\u201d6 Alma and his people were soon placed in bondage, and \u201cso great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.\u201d In addition, they were even commanded by their captors to stop praying, otherwise, \u201cwhosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.\u201d7 Alma and his people had done nothing to deserve their new condition. How would they respond?\nRather than blame God, they turned to Him and \u201cdid pour out their hearts to him.\u201d In response to their faith and silent prayers, the Lord responded: \u201cBe of good comfort. \u2026 I will \u2026 ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs.\u201d Soon after, \u201cthe Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.\u201d8 Although not yet delivered from bondage, by turning to the Lord, and not from the Lord, they were blessed according to their needs and according to the Lord\u2019s wisdom.\nElder Dallin\u00a0H. Oaks has taught: \u201cHealing blessings come in many ways, each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. Sometimes a \u2018healing\u2019 cures our illness or lifts our burden. But sometimes we are \u2018healed\u2019 by being given strength or understanding or patience to bear the burdens placed upon us.\u201d9\nUltimately, \u201cso great was their faith and their patience\u201d that Alma and his people were delivered by the Lord, as will we, \u201cand they gave thanks,\u201d \u201cfor they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God.\u201d10\nThe sad irony is that, too often, those most in need turn away from their one perfect source of help\u2014our Savior, Jesus Christ. A familiar scriptural account of the brazen serpent teaches us that we have a choice when faced with challenges. After many of the children of Israel were bitten by \u201cfiery flying serpents,\u201d11 \u201ca type was raised up \u2026 that whosoever would look \u2026 might live. [But it was a choice.] And many did look and live.\n\u201c\u2026 But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished.\u201d12\nLike the ancient Israelites, we are also invited and encouraged to look to the Savior and live\u2014for His yoke is easy and His burden is light, even when ours may be heavy.\nAlma the Younger taught this sacred truth when he said, \u201cI do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.\u201d13\nIn these latter days, the Lord has provided us with numerous resources, our \u201cbrazen serpents,\u201d all of which are designed to help us look to Christ and place our trust in Him. Dealing with the challenges of life is not about ignoring reality but rather where we choose to focus and the foundation upon which we choose to build.\nThese resources include, but are not limited to:\nRegular study of the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets.\nFrequent, sincere prayer and fasting.\nWorthily partaking of the sacrament.\nRegular temple attendance.\nPriesthood blessings.\nWise counseling through trained professionals.\nAnd even medication, when properly prescribed and used as authorized.\nWhatever change in life\u2019s circumstance may come our way, and whatever unexpected path we may have to travel, how we respond is a choice. Turning to the Savior and grasping His outstretched arm is always our best option.\nElder Richard\u00a0G. Scott taught this eternal truth: \u201cTrue enduring happiness with the accompanying strength, courage, and capacity to overcome the most challenging difficulties comes from a life centered in Jesus Christ. \u2026 There is no guarantee of overnight results, but there is absolute assurance that, in the Lord\u2019s time, solutions will come, peace will prevail, and emptiness will be filled.\u201d14\nTo these truths I share my witness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Bishop W.\u00a0Christopher Waddell\nTurn to the Lord\n2017\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Colonel Thomas L. Kane, a nonmember of the Church, spoke to the Historical Society of Philadelphia, as recorded in the memoirs of John R. Young. He told them that during his travels a few years before, he had passed through a very unusual city named Nauvoo, a community established on the banks of the Mississippi. He explained that after traveling up the river for some time, he left the steamer and began to travel on land because of the rapids in the river.\nWhile on the road, he had seen only unimproved country where idlers and outlaws had settled. Then he saw Nauvoo. Quoting him:\n\u201cI was descending the last hillside upon my journey, when a landscape in delightful contrast broke upon my view. Half encircled by a bend of the river, a beautiful city lay glittering in the fresh morning sun. Its bright new dwellings, [were] set in cool green gardens ranging up around a stately dome-shaped hill, which was crowned by a noble marble edifice, whose high tapering spire was radiant with white and gold. The city appeared to cover several miles, and beyond it, in the backgrounds, there rolled off a fair country chequered by the careful lines of fruitful husbandry. The unmistakable marks of industry, enterprise and educated wealth everywhere, made the scene one of singular and most striking beauty. \u2026 No one met me there. I looked and saw no one. I could hear no one move, though the quiet everywhere was such that I heard the flies buzz and the water ripples break against the shallow beach. I walked through the solitary streets. The town lay as in a dream, under some deadening spell of loneliness, from which I almost feared to wake it, for plainly it had not slept long. There was no grass growing up in the paved ways, rains had not entirely washed away the prints of dusty footsteps, yet I went about unchecked. I went into empty workshops, rope walks and smithies. The spinner\u2019s wheel was idle, the carpenter had gone from his work bench and shavings, his unfinished sash and casings, fresh bark was in the tanner\u2019s vat, and fresh chopped, light wood stood piled against the baker\u2019s oven. The blacksmith\u2019s shop was cold; but his coal heap and ladling pool and crooked water horn were all there, as if he had just gone for a holiday. \u2026\n\u201cFields upon fields of heavy headed yellow grain lay rotting. \u2026 No one was at hand to take in their rich harvest.\u201d (Memoirs of John R. Young, Utah Pioneer 1847, Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1920, pp. 31\u201333.)\nColonel Kane could not understand why such a beautiful city had been abandoned. He was unaware that the Saints had been driven from their city by the mobs. His curiosity caused him to search for the people who had left the city. When he found them, he observed that even though they were suffering and dying from hunger and exposure, they were peaceful and wholesome. Why had such a harmless people been so persecuted?\nIn many ways the situation has not changed a great deal today. The Church still faces some situations which, in many ways, are similar to the Nauvoo period. There is not, of course, the same degree of antagonism manifest against us as in our early history. But we still must wonder, as Colonel Kane did, why it is sometimes directed, as it so recently has been, against our great missionary force. I can only guess that it is because of the widespread misunderstanding of the essential purposes for which our missionaries are called to serve.\nThe missionary purpose has not changed with time. We recall the account of Ammon in the Book of Mormon. His missionary call was to the land of the Lamanites\u2014a dangerous assignment. The fate of a Nephite entering the land of the Lamanites was left entirely in the hands of their king, who could slay him, cast him into prison, or force him to leave.\n\u201cAnd thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.\n\u201cAnd the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.\n\u201cAnd Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.\n\u201cBut Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.\u201d (Alma 17:21\u201325.)\nAs with Ammon, the only desire of our army of modern missionaries is to serve their fellowmen.\nIt has been over 160 years since Samuel Smith left his home with a knapsack on his back filled with a few copies of the newly printed Book of Mormon. He left to declare his witness of the truths contained in this book and to extend an invitation to anyone interested to read its contents and discover for themselves whether it be true. Since Samuel Smith\u2019s time, thousands of our missionaries have given their time and their means and left their homes for a season to declare a message they believe to be true.\nToday we have a multinational force coming from many nations and spreading themselves among a great number of other nations of the world. Missionaries go forward with the purest of intent, with no hidden agenda, and at great personal sacrifice. They are not out to destroy anyone\u2019s faith or to exert unrighteous pressure. They are teachers who invite those interested in their message to listen and determine for themselves if the message is true. They go forward not representing any government or political philosophy. Furthermore, they will not be active nor participate in, encourage, or even express an opinion on the politics of the country in which they are called to labor.\nMissionaries return home with a love for the people they have served and taught. They are true ambassadors spreading goodwill for the peoples in whose countries they have lived and worked. They are not concerned with income levels and have no racial bias. They are not out to build any worldly kingdoms. They are, in the words of Mormon, \u201cthe peaceable followers of Christ.\u201d (Moro. 7:3.) The only kingdom which interests them is the kingdom of our Lord and Savior which He will establish at His return. Their only hope is to prepare us for that great day. Until then, our missionaries, as well as all members of the Church, will be \u201csubject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates,\u201d and will be found \u201cobeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\u201d (A of F 1:12.)\nNow I would like to change subjects and conclude my remarks with some counsel to the membership of the Church. We have been taught about the mission of our Lord and Savior and that by following Him we receive the greatest joy and happiness to be found here on earth. We have experienced the joy of service in our Heavenly Father\u2019s kingdom and know the soul-satisfying fulfillment it brings to our lives. I often think of the challenge which Alma faced when he could see the urgent need of the people to be taught the importance of having an understanding of the gospel of our Lord and Savior. At that time he served in two positions, that of chief judge and high priest over all the Church. He had to make a choice between the two in order to maximize his effectiveness in serving the people. The book of Alma records:\n\u201cAnd he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people. \u2026\n\u201cNow Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.\n\u201cAnd this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.\u201d (Alma 4:16, 18\u201319.)\nHe selected for himself the position which would allow him to do the most good for his people.\nSometimes, however, in our enthusiasm for the gospel, we cast our pearls indiscriminately, and we might even be tempted to enhance the luster of our pearl of great price by placing it in a much too attractive setting. This may only detract from the true value of our pearl. Our pearl will stand on its own, with all its beauty and simplicity. We do not need to enhance it with bright and flashy things that will only bring antagonism and conflict to the Church. We need to speak less about our accomplishments and, by our actions, show which kingdom we seek.\nCould I offer this little suggestion to you? In the elevators in the Church Office Building we place scriptures and sayings of the prophets to make the time that people spend in the elevators productive as they ride up and down. This is an idea we could carry into our homes. We have an appliance we use all too frequently in our homes\u2014the refrigerator. We need to place a sign on our refrigerators to elevate our thoughts. And by so doing, we could remind ourselves of the scriptures as we go about our daily duties\u2014of who we are and what we represent. Could I suggest just a few scriptures to you for starters? The first is in the book of Matthew 5:43\u201344 [Matt. 5:43\u201344]:\n\u201cYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\n\u201cBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d\nMaybe a second would be from Luke 6:35:\n\u201cBut love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\u201d\nAnd in James 1:27 we read:\n\u201cPure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d\nFinally, display one of the great scriptures from the Book of Mormon, Moro. 7:47:\n\u201cBut charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.\u201d\nI love the gospel of our Lord and Savior. It has brought into my life the greatest peace of mind, joy, and happiness I could ever hope to find on this earth. I pray that each of us might be willing and able to share this pearl of great price\u2014a pearl of lasting and singular beauty\u2014with all of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children, that we may go forward armed with the gospel of our Lord and Savior. This is His work in which we\u2019re engaged. God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. This is my solemn witness to you, in His holy name, amen.\nL. Tom Perry\n\u201cThe Peaceable Followers of Christ\u201d\n1989\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I would like to tell you about a little bird that was lying on the parking lot pavement. During the night it had been blown from its nest by the high winds in the storm. Apparently hatched just a few days earlier, it had few feathers, but enough to identify it as just a common sparrow.\nAs it lay there awaiting whatever fate would come, a young woman walking to her car in the parking lot saw the little sparrow and picked it up. Feeling sympathy for the helpless little bird she took it home to care for it. She prepared a nest in a basket with soft tissues, which were changed often to keep a clean and comfortable bed for the little bird.\nShe fed it often each day, watching it gain strength, and within a few days it opened its eyes and could see for the first time. It saw the girl who fed it and the family who lived in the home. It heard and became accustomed to the sounds around it, and it was not afraid.\nAs the days passed, it was able to hop about, and it was taken from the basket and put into a clean birdcage.\nIt trusted the girl and the family, and when it wanted food, it would chirp and flutter its growing wings rapidly, and when the cage door was opened it would hop out onto the girl\u2019s hand and sit there patiently while she fed it.\nIt would sit on her hand as she walked through the house and even when she went outside. To help it become accustomed to the outside world where it soon would have to live, she would take it out on the lawn where she and her sister would sit under the tree and visit while the bird would look and observe all around it.\nIt came time for the girl and her sister to go to girls\u2019 camp, so the bird went with them and spent the week on Cedar Mountain with the girls. It was there that it tried to fly for the first time, flying from the girl\u2019s hand to the low branches in a nearby tree.\nIt was glad to come back to the familiar hand and security of the girl\u2019s love, and although it was learning to fly it did not leave. When the girls\u2019 camp was over the bird came home with the girls and continued its flying lessons.\nThe girl, realizing the bird must soon join its own kind, took it out on the front lawn and encouraged it to fly away. It flew across the lawn to a small pine tree, where it perched and looked around. The girl left it there, assuming it would now join the other birds, and she returned into the home.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before a chirping could be heard outside in front of the home, and when the girl went out to see what the bird was chirping about, it flew out of the tree and landed back on her hand, and she fed it.\nFor the first few nights the bird would come back to the house and want to come in with the family for the night. Soon, however, it began to stay out with newly found friends living in the trees close by the home. When the girl would go outside and whistle, it would respond and return and land on her hand, and my daughter, Trinilee, would feed it.\nThat little bird and my daughter taught me a great lesson in faith and trust. Although it was just a fraction of the size of its human friend and could be in great danger for its life amongst humans, it trusted her and had faith it would not be harmed and would be fed by her\u2014and it responded to her beckoning call.\nHave you ever wondered about our faith, brethren? Do we have that kind of trust and faith in the Lord? Do we respond to His beckoning call to serve and be fed at His hand?\nWe should strive to be in His presence and to respond to His call, yet many of us lack the faith and the trust to come unto the Lord when He calls. He is calling us today to be faithful and to trust Him, that He might feed us.\n\u201cAnd Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me\u201d (Moro. 7:33).\n\u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Matt. 28:19).\nThere is an urgent and important work to be done in all nations and amongst all people. There are many wonderful young men and women, senior sisters, and couples who have been called to serve and who have responded and are faithfully serving a mission for the Lord.\nThere is a great need for many more missionaries, including couples, as President Hinckley in his February 21, 1998, satellite broadcast said: \u201cWith concerted effort, with recognition of the duty that falls upon each of us as members of the Church, and with sincere prayer to the Lord for help, we could double the number\u201d of convert baptisms.\n\u201cFor behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul\u201d (D&C 4:4).\nThere is not a work of greater importance or of greater joy and reward that we could do at this time.\nThe Savior, speaking through the Prophet Joseph Smith, said to John Whitmer: \u201cAnd now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father. Amen\u201d (D&C 15:6).\nBrethren, I believe our Heavenly Father and I trust Him, and when He reveals to us, speaking through our living prophet today, that we need to do more, and more of us need to become involved in the work of bringing souls unto Christ, then we need to step forward and say, \u201cHere am I; send me\u201d (Isa. 6:8).\nFrom a favorite hymn I quote:\nCome, all ye sons of God who have received the priesthood;\nGo spread the gospel wide and gather in his people.\nAnd after their baptism, we need to walk the path to exaltation with them, steadying them until they have a solid foundation and testimony to carry them on through time and into life eternal.\nI truly love my Heavenly Father and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and I am grateful for the many blessings and opportunities They have given me. I pray with all my heart and soul that I can measure up to the plans They have for me, whatever those plans may be.\nI pray we will all show an equal amount of faith and trust in the Lord that the little sparrow demonstrated in my daughter, and respond to the call of the Lord.\nI pray that we will indeed all do it together in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nH. Bruce Stucki\nThe Faith of a Sparrow:Faith and Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ\n1999\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "This is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are Christians. We know additional details about the Savior\u2019s role in the premortal existence before we came here: we have new information about His part in the creation of the world under the direction of our Father; we can identify Him as Jehovah of the Old Testament, communicating with the prophets of Israel. We have the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Jesus Christ, which has great illuminating doctrines and information about the Savior. Our modern prophets have given revealed explanations, doctrines, light, and knowledge on the Christ as the Redeemer to whom we look for the remission of our sins. We have a wealth of information of tremendous value to all Christian churches. We do not diminish or tear down the faith others have in Christ, but seek only to share with them our additional knowledge of the Lamb, the Shepherd, the Holy One of Israel (see Ps. 71:22)\u2014for their benefit and salvation.\nLike Nephi of old, \u201cwe believe in Christ, we \u2026 look forward with steadfastness unto Christ. \u2026 We are made alive in Christ because of our faith. \u2026 We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ. \u2026 We \u2026 look forward unto that life which is in Christ.\u201d (2 Ne. 25:24\u201327.) Can anyone doubt that we are Christians in the full sense of the word?\nSome time ago, I was on an airplane over the Colombian jungle of South America. I had been telling my seat companion about the Church. At one point in my enthusiastic gospel conversation, my friend commented, \u201cYou Mormons have surely built a magnificent shrine at Joseph Smith\u2019s grave site.\u201d\nIn surprise, I exclaimed, \u201cWhat shrine\u2014what grave site?\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cWhy that tall building in Salt Lake City with the gold angel on top. Isn\u2019t that a mausoleum or a shrine of some kind where you worship your prophet?\u201d He was referring to the great Salt Lake Temple.\nIn dismay, I recognized his misunderstanding. No telling where it came from. I proceeded to correct the error, to the best of my ability.\nI said to my friend, \u201cPlease allow me to explain that we definitely are Christians\u2014we do worship God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, and we do not worship any prophet or any saint\u2014modern or of ancient times. We do not worship the Prophet Joseph Smith, although we love and honor him. But we never pray to him. In our doctrine, philosophy, and practice, he is not an intermediary of any kind, nor is any other prophet or saint. Christ alone is the advocate with the Father\u201d\u2014and I repeated for emphasis\u2014\u201cnot Mary, not Joseph, not Peter, James, or John, not any of the ancient prophets like Adam, Moses, or Abraham. No modern prophet like Joseph Smith or Brigham Young is ever worshiped or prayed to.\u201d\nI went on further to explain that the temple in Salt Lake City is not to honor the Prophet Joseph, nor is he even buried there. To make my point that we do not worship our prophets, I said, \u201cPlease believe me when I say that we never make a pilgrimage to where the Prophet Joseph is buried; as a matter of fact, I do not even know where he is buried!\u201d\nThis explanation of my not knowing where Joseph Smith is buried seemed to be the most dramatic kind of clarification my friend could have received. He was thoroughly astonished, but he could easily see that his understanding of our Church had been completely wrong. This turnabout then led to a conversation in which truths regarding how we do worship the Savior could be discussed easily and openly. The positive fact that we are practicing Christians was established.\nI believe it to be the responsibility of every member of the Church to so live and teach and preach that there will never be any doubt on the part of our friends, associates, and casual acquaintances as to our being Christians, having the desire to receive redemption through Him; to be the kind of person that is a friend of the Savior, a servant of the Savior, and a son or a daughter of the Savior. Let me discuss each one of these three roles:\nFirst, Be a Friend of the Savior.\nPresident Kimball qualifies as a friend of the Savior. When he was in the hospital ready to undergo open-heart surgery a few years ago, he was being wheeled down the hall and into the operating room by a young orderly. The young man accidentally smashed his finger between the metal door frame and the metal frame of the bed on which lay the already sedated prophet. When this mishap occurred, the young man, in pain, used an unfortunate expression in which he took in vain the name of the Savior. The prophet stirred, opened his eyes, and gently rebuked the orderly, saying, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t say that; He\u2019s my best friend!\u201d\nDo you and I have a relationship with the Savior such that we would decry the misuse of His name? Does Jesus know that we feel about Him the way President Kimball feels about Him?\nAnother example of President Kimball\u2019s discipleship occurred one Christmas Eve several years ago. He called and asked if I were busy. I quickly responded, \u201cNot at all. What can I do for you, President Kimball?\u201d He told me he needed a companion to go with him to the Primary Children\u2019s Hospital to give a few blessings. It turned out that he had heard of several children from South America, as well as some American Indian children, who were in the hospital. We went from floor to floor giving blessings to all the Latins and Lamanites and many others too. I was deeply affected by the love of President Kimball and his tender friendship with each child. He was a friend to the sick\u2014a friend to those far from home. He exemplified the tender, loving friendship that the Savior would give. It was easy to see how he could say, \u201cThe Savior is my best friend.\u201d\nSecond, Be a Servant of the Savior.\nKing Benjamin made this clear:\n\u201cFor how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?\u201d (Mosiah 5:13.)\nHow can we possibly be a servant to the Savior if we have not served Him, if we are strangers to Him, if we keep Him far from the daily thoughts and intents of our hearts?\nPresident Harold B. Lee was the kind of person who so knew the Savior and had been a servant for such a long period of time that he knew instinctively what the Savior would say or do in any given situation.\nFor example, shortly after becoming President of the Church, President Lee held his first press conference as the new prophet of the Church. The reporters posed for President Lee what could have been a difficult question: \u201cWhat is your position with regard to the Vietnam war?\u201d You recall that at that time the war was underway, and there were those who supported it and those who were against our involvement.\nIf President Lee said, \u201cI am in favor of our government\u2019s position,\u201d the reporters could say, \u201cHow strange\u2014a spiritual leader in favor of war?\u201d If he answered, \u201cI am against our government\u2019s involvement,\u201d the reporters could also raise doubts by saying, \u201cHow unusual\u2014a religious leader who pretends to support his government, but does not?\u201d\nWhen the people of the press presented the question, President Lee responded as a servant of the Savior would, knowing how to use the very words of the Lord in an inspired manner. His answer disarmed them, impressed them. As I remember, he said, \u201cWe, together with the entire Christian world, abhor war.\u201d And he went on, \u201cThe Savior said, \u2018In the world ye shall have tribulations.\u2019 But He also said, \u2018In me ye might have peace\u2019.\u201d (See John 16:33.) Continuing, President Lee quoted from John 14: \u201c\u2018Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I [peace] unto you.\u2019\u201d (John 14:27.)\nAnd then President Lee taught a great principle. And he said to them: \u201cThe Savior was not speaking of the kind of peace which is won with armies or navies or force; nor was He speaking of the kind of peace which can be negotiated in the halls of congresses. He was speaking of the kind of peace we each can have in our hearts only when we live His commandments to such a degree that we know He is pleased with us.\u201d President Lee, speaking as a true servant of the Prince of Peace, had answered them with inspiration.\nThird, Be a Son or a Daughter of the Savior.\nLet there be no confusion\u2014our Heavenly Father is the Father of our spirits. He is also the Father of the spirit of Jesus. The Holy Trinity is not a blur, but rather three separate and distinct personages. Heavenly Father gave to His Son those of His children who would take upon themselves the name of His Son, demonstrating faith in Him by repenting of their sins and entering the holy waters of baptism and then going forth steadfastly in His kingdom forever.\nKing Benjamin tells us:\n\u201cAnd now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.\u201d (Mosiah 5:7.)\nI pray that the entire membership of this church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will so live that if there are any who would accuse us falsely of not being Christians, their words would not be believed by any who know us. Let us so live that every person who has ever met a member of this Church would know that we all strive daily to be better friends of the Savior, more unselfish servants of the Savior, more like sons and daughters given by the Father to our Savior by virtue of our taking His name upon us in the holy waters of baptism.\nTo this I testify humbly and with love, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master and Redeemer, amen.\nRobert E. Wells\nBe a Friend, a Servant, a Son of the Savior\n1982\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "We Latter-day Saints have a divine message for the world. It is that God has spoken again from the heavens in these last days and has given us once more the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in a great new revelation of his will.\nAre you surprised that God would speak in these times? Are we who live today less important to him than those who lived two thousand years ago? Is he a respecter of persons?\nIs not the same gospel required to save us as was needed in the days of Peter and Paul? There is only one gospel. There is only one Savior, and he gave us only one straight and narrow way to salvation, although, unfortunately, \u201cfew there be that find it.\u201d (Matt. 7:14.)\nOver the centuries there has been a great departure from the original Christian teachings, resulting in a multiplicity of creeds and denominations.\nBut Christ himself is not divided\u2014not the true Christ. This was fully explained by the apostle Paul as he wrote to the Corinthians and upbraided them for the divisions which existed among them.\n\u201cIs Christ divided?\u201d he demanded of them. \u201cWas Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\u201d (1 Cor. 1:13.)\nSo he challenged them, saying, \u201cEvery one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ\u201d (1 Cor. 1:12), thus showing the ruptures which had broken out among these people whom Paul had converted only a short time before. But this was one of the symptoms of those times\u2014evidence that even in Paul\u2019s day Christianity was beginning to disintegrate.\nIt is evident from the scriptures that through the foreknowledge of God the ancient apostles were shown in advance that Christianity would be splintered, that its unity for which Christ had prayed would be destroyed, and that thus would come a general falling away from the original truth.\nBut the Lord was not content to abandon a shattered Christianity. He was still determined to save mankind if they would obey him. Therefore, knowing in advance that a falling away would take place, he provided for a restoration of the original truth in the latter days. This was voiced through the apostle Peter as one day he discoursed upon the second coming of the Lord. He explained that the Lord\u2019s second coming would be preceded in the latter days by a restoration of the gospel which would be so extensive as to return all that God had spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets from the beginning of the world. (See Acts 3.)\nBut how was this to be accomplished? Do the scriptures tell us? Indeed they do, for they say that the gospel would be brought back to earth by an angel, \u201cflying in the midst of heaven\u201d in the hour of God\u2019s judgment, that this truth might be preached to \u201cevery nation, kindred, tongue and people.\u201d (Rev. 14:6.)\nBut the scriptures also say that a second angel would come as part of this great new revelation of God. They even identify him by name, and say that this second heavenly personage would be Elijah of old who was taken into heaven without tasting death. Remarkable, isn\u2019t it?\nWe testify that the first angel has come already, and that he committed the gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith a century and a half ago. We Latter-day Saints are the custodians of that gospel, and we are presently taking it to all the free world.\nBut what about this second angel? If the first one brought the gospel, what purpose was there in the coming of the second one? Why should Elijah be sent to the earth again in these last days?\nThe prophet Malachi explained. Elijah, he said, would come to earth \u201cbefore \u2026 the great and dreadful day of the Lord:\n\u201cAnd he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\u201d (Mal. 4:5\u20136.)\nThis is a passage of scripture which has greatly puzzled the Bible scholars. They cannot tell what it means. Many have guessed and speculated, but none have really known.\nWhat does this scripture mean? Why was Elijah to come back to earth? Obviously there was some family relationship involved, since he was to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. What could it mean?\nThe significance of that scripture was not made known until after the first angel had restored the gospel. In fact, it was the restored gospel that opened our minds to the purpose of Elijah\u2019s coming.\nIts great meaning was that salvation may come to all who have lived on the earth, even the dead as far back as the days of Adam, if they will only believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Both the living and the dead may be saved.\nBut how can this be?\nJesus explained that he is God of both the living and the dead, and that, in fact, even the dead are alive unto him. (See Luke 20:38.)\nHowever, he has but one gospel; and since both living and dead are alike unto him, both living and dead must be saved by the same gospel principles. The Lord is no respecter of persons.\nSalvation comes only through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance from sin, and baptism by immersion in water for the remission of sins performed by one in authority.\nBut can the dead comply with these terms? Yes, they can if they will. But how is it possible?\nPeter taught that while Christ\u2019s body lay in the tomb after the crucifixion his eternal spirit went to the realm of the dead, who were alive and alert in a spirit existence. Each person was still himself. Each could listen and learn\u2014and so they did, for Jesus taught them his gospel just as he had taught it here on earth. (See 1 Pet. 3.)\nPeter further said: \u201cFor for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.\u201d (1 Pet. 4:6.)\nWould Jesus have preached to them if they could not hear and understand? Would he have preached faith and repentance if they were not able to believe and repent? Is not the Savior practical and realistic?\nBut what about baptism and other saving ordinances?\nPaul now comes to our aid. He made it known that in the early church there existed an arrangement whereby the living could be baptized for and in behalf of their dead, and thus would baptism be made available to the departed.\nBut who can do this, and by what authority? By what means may we identify the dead so that we may know for whom this work is done?\nThat is why Elijah came in fulfillment of Malachi\u2019s prophecy. And we testify that he has come, that he appeared in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836\u2014one hundred and forty years ago to this very day.\nHis coming was to teach us, the living, that the dead may be saved, and that we are to be instruments in the hands of God in helping to bring this about. In this way his coming turns our hearts to our dead kindred.\nThe dead now hear the gospel in the realm where they live, and, knowing that their saving ordinances must be performed vicariously by us, they turn their hearts of necessity to us, hoping that we will do this work for them. So Elijah\u2019s mission is being fulfilled.\nWe Latter-day Saints have undertaken our share of this great work. We have built holy temples in which these vicarious ordinances are performed. We have established the finest genealogical library in the world, where we may research the identifying information for our dead kindred.\nBut even so, there are many who yet do not comprehend this doctrine, neither do they understand their responsibility in it.\nBe it known that each living person is responsible to assist in the salvation of his own deceased relatives. Our own salvation is largely dependent upon it. We cannot be made perfect without our ancestors, and they cannot be made perfect without us. (See Heb. 11:40.) And why?\nThe requirement of the Lord is that each couple must be married for eternity and each child must be bound to his or her own parents by the power of the holy priesthood. This process must be carried back into the past as far as we can obtain genealogical information to justify it. This is in addition to the baptisms we may perform for our dead.\nIf we fail to do this work, we place our own salvation in question.\nWhat is our obligation then? Each one of us\u2014if we pretend to obey the gospel at all\u2014must search out our dead and have these saving ordinances performed for them.\nMany suppose that they are discharging their responsibilities by simply \u201cgoing to the temple.\u201d But that is not wholly true. We must go to the temple, of course, and often. It we do not as yet have the records of our own dead kindred, then while we search for them, by all means let us help others with theirs.\nBut be it understood that if we go to the temple, and not for our own dead, we are performing only a part of our duty, because we are also required to go there specifically to save our own dead relatives and bind the various generations together by the power of the holy priesthood.\nWe must disabuse our minds of the idea that merely \u201cgoing to the temple\u201d discharges our full responsibility, because it does not. That is not enough.\nWe must get down to specifics and do the work for our own dead progenitors.\nGod holds each of us responsible for saving our own kindred\u2014specifically our own.\nPresident Joseph Fielding Smith, discoursing on this subject at one time, said:\n\u201cIt matters not what else we have been called to do, or what position we may occupy, or how faithfully in other ways we have labored in the Church, none are exempt from this great obligation [of performance of temple work for the dead].\n\u201cIt is required of the apostle as well as of the humblest elder. Place, or distinction, or long service in the Church, in the mission field, the Stakes of Zion, or where or how else it may have been will not entitle one to disregard the salvation of one\u2019s dead.\n\u201cSome may feel that if they pay their tithing, attend their regular meetings and other duties, give of their substance to feed the poor, perchance spend one or two or more years preaching in the world, that they are absolved from further duty.\n\u201cBut the greatest and grandest duty of all is to labor for the dead. We may and should do all these other things, for which reward will be given, but if we neglect the weightier privilege and commandment, notwithstanding all other good works, we shall find ourselves under severe condemnation.\u201d (Seeking after Our Dead, Genealogical Society of Utah, 1928, pp. 35\u201336.)\nWhen we say that we must do work specifically for our own blood lines, what do we mean?\nWe mean that first we will do the genealogical research to identify our own particular progenitors and their families. Then we are to go to the temple for the ordinance work required for these our own specific relatives who are dead and whom we have identified by our genealogical research. We are to be sealed in a specific priesthood line to our own specific forefathers, and they must specifically be sealed to us.\nBut remember we cannot thus bind the generations together in our own blood lines unless we specifically identify our people first. Hence the overpowering need for a well-directed genealogical program in each family.\nI hope you will forgive me for being so specific here, but I do not know any other way of specifically explaining the specific points I specifically have in mind.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith said that it is necessary that those who have lived before us and those who come after us should have salvation in common with us. He said that without these ordinances, provided in the temples, neither we nor our dead can receive our eternal advancement. (See Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 356.)\nEveryone who wishes to receive ultimate salvation, the Prophet Joseph said, \u201cmust go through all the ordinances for each one of them [our kindred] separately, the same as for himself, from baptism to ordination, \u2026 and receive all the keys and powers of the Priesthood the same as for himself.\u201d (Teachings, p. 363.)\nHe also said: \u201cIf you [will] receive it, this is the spirit of Elijah, that we redeem our dead, and connect ourselves with our fathers \u2026 and seal up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection.\u201d (Teachings, pp. 337\u201338; italics added.)\nAnd again he added: \u201cHow are they [the Saints] to become saviors on Mount Zion?\u201d He answered his own question as he said: \u201cBy building their temples, erecting their baptismal fonts, and going forth and receiving all the ordinances \u2026 in behalf of all their progenitors who are dead.\u201d (Teachings, p. 330.)\nIf we believe in the restoration of the gospel at all, we must believe also in the mission of Elijah. We declare that he has come to earth and delivered the keys of his ministry to the Prophet Joseph Smith. As a result of his labors, the hearts of both the fathers and the children are now turning to each other, and this vital work is being done.\nBut each of us must do our part for our own deceased relatives. It is so essential that it must be given a high priority in our daily lives. And that we may give it this great priority is my humble prayer in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nMark E. Petersen\nThe Message of Elijah\n1976\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "There are some lines attributed to Victor Hugo which read:\n\u201cShe broke the bread into two fragments and gave them to her children, who ate with eagerness. \u2018She hath kept none for herself,\u2019 grumbled the sergeant.\n\u201c\u2018Because she is not hungry,\u2019 said a soldier.\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said the sergeant, \u2018because she is a mother.\u2019\u201d\nIn a year when we are celebrating the faith and valor of those who made that exacting trek across Iowa, Nebraska, and Wyoming, I wish to pay tribute to the modern counterparts of those pioneer mothers who watched after, prayed for, and far too often buried their babies on that long trail. To the women within the sound of my voice who dearly want to be mothers and are not, I say through your tears and ours on that subject, God will yet, in days that lie somewhere ahead, bring \u201chope to [the] desolate heart.\u201d1 As prophets have repeatedly taught from this pulpit, ultimately \u201cno blessing shall be withheld\u201d from the faithful, even if those blessings do not come immediately.2 In the meantime we rejoice that the call to nurture is not limited to our own flesh and blood.\nIn speaking of mothers I do not neglect the crucial, urgent role of fathers, particularly as fatherlessness in contemporary homes is considered by some to be \u201cthe central social problem of our time.\u201d3 Indeed, fatherlessness can be a problem even in a home where the father is present\u2014eating and sleeping, so to speak, \u201cby remote.\u201d But that is a priesthood message for another day. Today I wish to praise those motherly hands that have rocked the infant\u2019s cradle and, through the righteousness taught to their children there, are at the very center of the Lord\u2019s purposes for us in mortality.\nIn so speaking I echo Paul, who wrote in praise of Timothy\u2019s \u201cunfeigned faith \u2026, which dwelt first,\u201d he said, \u201cin thy grandmother Lois, and [in] thy mother Eunice.\u201d4 \u201cFrom [the days when thou wert] a child,\u201d Paul said, \u201cthou hast known the holy scriptures.\u201d5 We give thanks for all the mothers and grandmothers from whom such truths have been learned at such early ages.\nIn speaking of mothers generally, I especially wish to praise and encourage young mothers. The work of a mother is hard, too often unheralded work. The young years are often those when either husband or wife\u2014or both\u2014may still be in school or in those earliest and leanest stages of developing the husband\u2019s breadwinning capacities. Finances fluctuate daily between low and nonexistent. The apartment is usually decorated in one of two smart designs\u2014Deseret Industries provincial or early Mother Hubbard. The car, if there is one, runs on smooth tires and an empty tank. But with night feedings and night teethings, often the greatest challenge of all for a young mother is simply fatigue. Through these years, mothers go longer on less sleep and give more to others with less personal renewal for themselves than any other group I know at any other time in life. It is not surprising when the shadows under their eyes sometimes vaguely resemble the state of Rhode Island.\nOf course the irony is that this is often the sister we want to call\u2014or need to call\u2014to service in the ward and stake auxiliaries. That\u2019s understandable. Who wouldn\u2019t want the exemplary influence of these young Loises- and Eunices-in-the-making? Everyone, be wise. Remember that families are the highest priority of all, especially in those formative years. Even so, young mothers will still find magnificent ways to serve faithfully in the Church, even as others serve and strengthen them and their families in like manner.\nDo the best you can through these years, but whatever else you do, cherish that role that is so uniquely yours and for which heaven itself sends angels to watch over you and your little ones. Husbands\u2014especially husbands\u2014as well as Church leaders and friends in every direction, be helpful and sensitive and wise. Remember, \u201cTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.\u201d6\nMothers, we acknowledge and esteem your faith in every footstep. Please know that it is worth it then, now, and forever. And if, for whatever reason, you are making this courageous effort alone, without your husband at your side, then our prayers will be all the greater for you, and our determination to lend a helping hand even more resolute.\nOne young mother wrote to me recently that her anxiety tended to come on three fronts. One was that whenever she heard talks on LDS motherhood, she worried because she felt she didn\u2019t measure up or somehow wasn\u2019t going to be equal to the task. Secondly, she felt like the world expected her to teach her children reading, writing, interior design, Latin, calculus, and the Internet\u2014all before the baby said something terribly ordinary, like \u201cgoo goo.\u201d Thirdly, she often felt people were sometimes patronizing, almost always without meaning to be, because the advice she got or even the compliments she received seemed to reflect nothing of the mental investment, the spiritual and emotional exertion, the long-night, long-day, stretched-to-the-limit demands that sometimes are required in trying to be and wanting to be the mother God hopes she will be.\nBut one thing, she said, keeps her going: \u201cThrough the thick and the thin of this, and through the occasional tears of it all, I know deep down inside I am doing God\u2019s work. I know that in my motherhood I am in an eternal partnership with Him. I am deeply moved that God finds His ultimate purpose and meaning in being a parent, even if some of His children make Him weep.\n\u201cIt is this realization,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I try to recall on those inevitably difficult days when all of this can be a bit overwhelming. Maybe it is precisely our inability and anxiousness that urge us to reach out to Him and enhance His ability to reach back to us. Maybe He secretly hopes we will be anxious,\u201d she said, \u201cand will plead for His help. Then, I believe, He can teach these children directly, through us, but with no resistance offered. I like that idea,\u201d she concludes. \u201cIt gives me hope. If I can be right before my Father in Heaven, perhaps His guidance to our children can be unimpeded. Maybe then it can be His work and His glory in a very literal sense.\u201d7\nIn light of that kind of expression, it is clear that some of those Rhode Island\u2013sized shadows come not just from diapers and carpooling but from at least a few sleepless nights spent searching the soul, seeking earnestly for the capacity to raise these children to be what God wants them to be. Moved by that kind of devotion and determination, may I say to mothers collectively, in the name of the Lord, you are magnificent. You are doing terrifically well. The very fact that you have been given such a responsibility is everlasting evidence of the trust your Father in Heaven has in you. He knows that your giving birth to a child does not immediately propel you into the circle of the omniscient. If you and your husband will strive to love God and live the gospel yourselves; if you will plead for that guidance and comfort of the Holy Spirit promised to the faithful; if you will go to the temple to both make and claim the promises of the most sacred covenants a woman or man can make in this world; if you will show others, including your children, the same caring, compassionate, forgiving heart you want heaven to show you; if you try your best to be the best parent you can be, you will have done all that a human being can do and all that God expects you to do.\nSometimes the decision of a child or a grandchild will break your heart. Sometimes expectations won\u2019t immediately be met. Every mother and father worries about that. Even that beloved and wonderfully successful parent President Joseph F. Smith pled, \u201cOh! God, let me not lose my own.\u201d8 That is every parent\u2019s cry, and in it is something of every parent\u2019s fear. But no one has failed who keeps trying and keeps praying. You have every right to receive encouragement and to know in the end your children will call your name blessed, just like those generations of foremothers before you who hoped your same hopes and felt your same fears.\nYours is the grand tradition of Eve, the mother of all the human family, the one who understood that she and Adam had to fall in order that \u201cmen [and women] might be\u201d9 and that there would be joy. Yours is the grand tradition of Sarah and Rebekah and Rachel, without whom there could not have been those magnificent patriarchal promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob which bless us all. Yours is the grand tradition of Lois and Eunice and the mothers of the 2,000 stripling warriors. Yours is the grand tradition of Mary, chosen and foreordained from before this world was, to conceive, carry, and bear the Son of God Himself. We thank all of you, including our own mothers, and tell you there is nothing more important in this world than participating so directly in the work and glory of God, in bringing to pass the mortality and earthly life of His daughters and sons, so that immortality and eternal life can come in those celestial realms on high.\nWhen you have come to the Lord in meekness and lowliness of heart and, as one mother said, \u201cpounded on the doors of heaven to ask for, to plead for, to demand guidance and wisdom and help for this wondrous task,\u201d that door is thrown open to provide you the influence and the help of all eternity. Claim the promises of the Savior of the world. Ask for the healing balm of the Atonement for whatever may be troubling you or your children. Know that in faith things will be made right in spite of you, or more correctly, because of you.\nYou can\u2019t possibly do this alone, but you do have help. The Master of Heaven and Earth is there to bless you\u2014He who resolutely goes after the lost sheep, sweeps thoroughly to find the lost coin, waits everlastingly for the return of the prodigal son. Yours is the work of salvation, and therefore you will be magnified, compensated, made more than you are and better than you have ever been as you try to make honest effort, however feeble you may sometimes feel that to be.\nRemember, remember all the days of your motherhood: \u201cYe have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\u201d10\nRely on Him. Rely on Him heavily. Rely on Him forever. And \u201cpress forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope.\u201d11 You are doing God\u2019s work. You are doing it wonderfully well. He is blessing you and He will bless you, even\u2014no, especially\u2014when your days and your nights may be the most challenging. Like the woman who anonymously, meekly, perhaps even with hesitation and some embarrassment, fought her way through the crowd just to touch the hem of the Master\u2019s garment, so Christ will say to the women who worry and wonder and sometimes weep over their responsibility as mothers, \u201cDaughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d12 And it will make your children whole as well.\nIn the sacred and holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nJeffrey R. Holland\n\u201cBecause She Is a Mother\u201d\n1997\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "A young father was literally sinking. He, his two children, and his father-in-law had gone for a walk around a lake. They were surrounded by majestic pine-covered mountains, and the sky was blue, filled with soft white clouds, emanating beauty and serenity. When the children grew hot and tired, the two men decided to put the children on their backs and swim the short distance across the lake.\nIt seemed easy\u2014until the moment when the father began to feel pulled down, everything becoming so heavy. Water pushed him to the bottom of the lake, and a frantic feeling came over him. How was he going to keep afloat\u2014and do so with his precious young daughter on his back?\nHis voice disappeared in the distance as he called out; his father-in-law was too far away to answer a desperate plea for help. He felt alone and helpless.\nCan you imagine feeling as alone as he felt, unable to reach anything to hold on to and struggling in a desperate situation for your life and your child? Unfortunately, all of us experience some degree of this feeling when we are in situations where we desperately need to find help in order to survive and to save those we love.\nNear panic, he realized that his water-saturated shoes were weighing him down. While working to stay afloat, he began to attempt to get his heavy shoes off his feet. But it was as if they were held on with suction. The laces were swollen with water, cinching the grip even tighter.\nIn what may have been his last moment of desperation, he managed to pry the shoes from his feet, and at last the shoes released their hold, quickly falling to the bottom of the lake. Free from the heavy weight that had been dragging him down, he immediately propelled himself and his daughter upward. He could now swim forward, moving toward safety on the other side of the lake.\nAt times we may all feel as if we are drowning. Life can be heavy. We live in \u201ca noisy and busy world. \u2026 If we are not careful, the things of this world can [drown] out the things of the Spirit.\u201d1\nHow do we follow the example of this father and kick off some of the weight of the world we carry, so we can keep our children\u2019s heads and our own worried minds above the water? How can we, as Paul counseled, \u201clay aside every weight\u201d?2 How can we prepare our children for the day when they can no longer cling to us and our testimonies\u2014when they are the ones swimming?\nAn answer comes when we recognize this divine source of strength. It is a source often underestimated, yet it can be used daily to lighten our load and guide our precious children. That source is the guiding gift of the Holy Ghost.\nAt age eight, children can experience baptism. They learn about and make a covenant with God. Those they love surround them as they are immersed and come out of the font with a feeling of great joy. Then they receive the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, a gift that may guide them constantly as they live for that blessing.\nElder David\u00a0A. Bednar said: \u201cThe simplicity of [confirmation] may cause us to overlook its significance. These four words\u2014\u2018Receive the Holy Ghost\u2019\u2014are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction\u2014an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon.\u201d3\nChildren have a natural desire to do good and to be good. We can feel their innocence, their purity. They also have a great sensitivity to the still, small voice.\nIn 3\u00a0Nephi 26, the Savior showed us the spiritual capacity of children:\n\u201cHe did loose their tongues, and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0They both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things.\u201d4\nHow do we as parents increase the spiritual capacity of our little ones? How do we teach them to kick off worldly influences and trust the Spirit when we are not with them and they are alone in the deep waters of their lives?\nLet me share with you some ideas.\nFirst, we can bring to our children\u2019s attention when they are hearing and feeling the Spirit. Let\u2019s go back in time to the Old Testament to see how Eli did just this for Samuel.\nYoung Samuel twice heard a voice and ran to Eli, saying, \u201cHere am I.\u201d\n\u201cI called not,\u201d responded Eli.\nBut \u201cSamuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.\u201d\nBy the third time, Eli perceived that the Lord had called Samuel and told Samuel to say, \u201cSpeak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.\u201d5\nSamuel was beginning to feel, recognize, and hearken to the Lord\u2019s voice. But this young boy didn\u2019t start to understand until Eli facilitated this recognition. And having been taught, Samuel could become more familiar with the still, small voice.\nSecond, we can prepare our homes and our children to feel the still, small voice. \u201cMany teachers of foreign languages believe that children learn a language best in \u2018immersion programs,\u2019 in which they are surrounded by other speakers of the language and called upon to speak it themselves. They learn not just to say words, but to speak fluently and even to think in the new language. The [best] \u2018immersion\u2019 setting for a spiritual education is in the home, where spiritual principles can form the basis for daily living.\u201d6\n\u201cThou shalt teach [the Lord\u2019s words] diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d7 Immersing our families in the Spirit will keep our children\u2019s hearts open to His influence.\nThird, we can help our children understand how the Spirit speaks to them. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cIf He comes to a little child, He will adapt himself to the language and capacity of a little child.\u201d8 One mother discovered that since children learn differently\u2014some learn visually, auditorily, tactilely, or kinesthetically\u2014the more she observed her children, the more she realized that the Holy Ghost teaches her children in ways they each learn best.9\nAnother mother shared an experience of helping her children learn to recognize the Spirit. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she wrote, \u201c[children] don\u2019t realize that a recurring thought, a feeling of comfort after they cry, or remembering something at just the right time are all ways that the Holy Ghost communicates [with them].\u201d She continues, \u201cI\u2019m teaching my [children] to focus on what they feel [and act on it].\u201d10\nFeeling and recognizing the Spirit will bring spiritual capacity into our children\u2019s lives, and the voice they come to know will become clearer and clearer to them. It will be as Elder Richard\u00a0G. Scott said: \u201cAs you gain experience and success in being guided by the Spirit, your confidence in the impressions you feel can become more certain than your dependence on what you see or hear.\u201d11\nWe need not fear as we see our children enter the waters of life, for we have helped them rid themselves of worldly weight. We have taught them to live for the guiding gift of the Spirit. This gift will continue to lighten the weight they carry and lead them back to their heavenly home if they live for it and follow its promptings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Mary\u00a0R. Durham\nA Child\u2019s Guiding Gift\n2016\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "As I address this vast body of priesthood brethren tonight, I do so in humility and with a prayer in my heart. The two subjects I will discuss come by assignment. The introduction to my first subject is recorded in the Old Testament as spoken by the prophet Isaiah:\n\u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\n\u201cIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\u201d\nFour wonderful blessings are promised by the Lord to those who obey the law of the fast:\n\u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.\n\u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.\n\u201cAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:\n\u201cAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d (Isa. 58:6\u201311.)\nRegarding this scripture, President Harold B. Lee had this to say:\n\u201cThe tremendous blessings that come [from fasting] have been spelled out in every dispensation. \u2026 If you analyze \u2026 the 58th chapter of the book of Isaiah [Isa. 58] you will find unraveled why the Lord wants us to pay fast offerings, why he wants us to fast. It\u2019s because by qualifying thus we can call and the Lord can answer. We can cry and the Lord will say, \u2018Here I am.\u2019 Do we ever want to be in a condition where we can call and he won\u2019t answer? We will cry in our distress and he won\u2019t be with us? I think it is time we are thinking about these fundamentals because these are the days that lie ahead, when we are going to need more and more the blessings of the Lord, when the judgments are poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.\u201d (\u201cListen and Obey,\u201d Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 14; Church Historical Library.)\nPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr., had this to say: \u201cThe fundamental principle of all Church relief work is that it must be carried on by fast offerings and other voluntary donations and contributions. This is the order established by the Lord. Tithing is not primarily designed for that purpose and must not be used except in the last extremity.\u201d (As quoted by Marion G. Romney, \u201cOur Primary Purpose,\u201d Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 8; Church Historical Library.)\nFast offering is the Lord\u2019s financial law given for the blessing of the poor. For many years it was understood that fast offerings should represent the cost of the two meals not eaten. This understanding came into being because, in the early days, members were generally asked to give the actual food saved by fasting. Conditions were so desperate that money would have been of little use. Later, the understanding seemed to be that $1 per capita would be adequate.\nHowever, in recent years, President Kimball has said of the fast offering: \u201cI think we should be very generous and give, instead of the amount we saved by our two meals of fasting, perhaps much, much more\u2014ten times more where we are in a position to do it.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1974, p. 184.)\nIt is important to recognize that the fast offering is a freewill offering, the amount of which each individual is responsible to determine. It is not the same as tithing, which is 10 percent of our interest annually. The amount is left up to each individual, and yet a living prophet has said we should be very generous. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if our faithfulness would generate fast offering funds sufficient to operate the entire storehouse system?\nPerhaps the following scriptures will give us some guidance as to how generous we should be:\nFirst, from the Doctrine and Covenants, section 42, beginning with verse 30. This is a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith regarding the law of consecration:\n\u201cAnd behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.\n\u201cAnd inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors. \u2026\n\u201cTherefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy.\u201d (D&C 42:30\u201331, 34.)\nThe Lord restates this principle many times, including section 70 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 7:\n\u201cNevertheless, inasmuch as they receive more than is needful for their necessities and their wants, it shall be given into my storehouse.\u201d\nFurther, you will recall when a certain ruler asked Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life, the Savior responded:\n\u201cThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.\n\u201cAnd he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.\n\u201cNow when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\n\u201cAnd when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.\n\u201cAnd when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n\u201cFor it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (Luke 18:20\u201325.)\nAgain, from the Doctrine and Covenants, we learn:\n\u201cFor it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.\n\u201cI, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.\n\u201cBut it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.\n\u201cFor the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.\n\u201cTherefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.\u201d (D&C 104:13\u201314, 16\u201318.)\nMay I conclude my remarks on fast offerings with portions of a letter I received several years ago from Elder John H. Groberg, who at that time was president of the Tongan Mission.\n\u201cEnclosed find a check for $1,000 for excess fast offerings from the Tongan Mission. Normally this letter would end here, but because of an experience I recently had I would like to add a little more.\n\u201cAs you may or may not be aware, Tonga is one of the poorest countries financially in the world. The average wage rate is only around 12\u00a2 per hour if you are lucky enough to have a job. \u2026\n\u201cRecently, while visiting one of the far distant islands that is very difficult to get to, I went late in the day to the home of one of the good widow sisters there.\n\u201cWhen I first approached her hut the sun was still quite bright and I could not help but notice the stark poverty of her surroundings. It had been raining earlier. The mud and decay and the ever-present smell of drying fish were at first repulsive. But the warmth of meeting with a fellow Church member\u2014especially after years of separation\u2014together with tears of appreciation for the long-awaited visit, soon pushed the unpleasantness of the surroundings temporarily into the background.\n\u201cAs we conversed in her fluid native tongue and she told of her love for and faith in the Church and of all the blessings she had received, I could not help but think about her apparently miserable circumstances. \u2026 All sorts of ideas went through my mind, and I must have let my thoughts wander as I suddenly became aware that somewhere between phrases about blessings and poverty and service she had gone to her hut and was now returning with a small knotted rag.\n\u201cSuddenly my mind seemed to fill with light, and the words \u2018fast offerings\u2019 flooded in. I was so excited with the idea that had come so suddenly and so clearly, that you can imagine my utter amazement and unpreparedness when she took a threepence (a coin worth about 3\u00a2) from her rag and said softly, \u2018Here is my fast offering \u2026 to help the poor.\u2019\n\u201cI wanted to explain that fast offering was to help her, not for her to help others. The explanation never came, for as I looked through misty eyes, first at the threepence then back at the good sister, the whole scene changed.\n\u201cThe hut was a glowing mansion and the mud was gold. \u2026 The world seemed to stand still for a moment. All of nature seemed to stop and listen as from the heavens the whole universe seemed filled with the reassuring words: \u2018Blessed are the poor \u2026 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u2019 (Matt. 5:3.)\n\u201cAs the setting sun signaled the end of the day, so it also told of the approaching end of her beautiful life of service.\n\u201cI took the threepence, and as I write this check the whole experience once again fills my mind and I wonder, \u2018How many threepences to make a thousand dollars?\u2019\u201d\nMay I encourage all bishops present tonight to remember this wonderful Tongan widow as you teach the law of the fast and as you bless the poor by wisely and judiciously expending these sacred funds.\nIn the sweet glow of this experience, let me talk now with you about stake and ward budgets. We are very concerned about the financial stress under which many of our people are laboring. Bishops, particularly, have the responsibility not to let programs become too expensive and thereby become a financial burden to the members.\nIt is all too easy for leaders to assume that others have discretionary income similar to their own. May I illustrate what I am talking about by quoting portions of a letter from a concerned mother:\n\u201cIn September, it was making and selling pizzas three nights a week and Saturday mornings to raise money for volleyball uniforms. There were class parties, New Beginnings, leadership workshops, and ward service projects.\n\u201cIn October and November it was volleyball practice and games three nights a week, a ward dinner, a Halloween party, a stake mid-week fireside, and a barn dance.\n\u201cIn January there have been basketball practices and games to start the sports program going again, a stake standards night, and a fund-raising project.\n\u201cIn February, along with the basketball games, there have been roadshow rehearsals three days of the week, a skiing party, a snow party, a stake camp meeting, and a workshop to finish up the Sesquicentennial projects to take up at least twenty-two days of this month.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I need not go on and on with this word picture. But still there is more you should know about: Coming up is a \u2018slave auction,\u2019 a car wash, a doughnut sale, a singing telegram project, lawn raking every Saturday morning until summer to raise money for a super activity in Idaho. There\u2019s an Aaronic Priesthood outing for both the boys and girls in May, two Scout overnights besides Beehive camp and Scout camp.\u201d\nWe are sufficiently concerned, that Elder Gordon B. Hinckley addressed this subject last evening in a special joint meeting with Regional Representatives and stake presidents. May I quote just a sentence or two from his remarks: \u201cI should like to say that sacrifice, where needed, is an important aspect of the gospel. It is of the very essence of true worship. But unnecessary sacrifice, that requested because of extravagance or poor management, is evil.\u201d You bishops should expect that your stake president will meet with you almost immediately upon returning from conference to evaluate both stake and ward budgets. The stake budget, of course, has an important impact on the ward budget.\nThere are some very specific areas which you should carefully evaluate.\nEnergy costs: Lights should be turned off when rooms are not in use. Air conditioning and heating should not be used unless absolutely necessary and particularly when the building or portions thereof are not in use.\nPaid custodial services: Such services should be reviewed with an eye to using ward members on a rotation basis to take care of the grounds and the basic cleaning. Thus professional custodial hours could be reduced and their efforts concentrated on maintaining mechanical and other complex systems. On this particular item, written suggestions will be forthcoming very soon.\nWelfare projects: Each project, through efficient management, should contribute to the commodity production budget to the maximum degree so as to reduce the need for cash contributions from the individual ward members to meet this commitment.\nActivities: Current policy is that the yearly budget include all ward and stake activity funding and that there not be any fund raising going on in addition to the budget. Youth conferences or activities that require expensive and extensive travel should be eliminated.\nThese are but a few of the ways of reducing the financial burden on the people.\nClearly we are preparing for the day when the higher law, that of consecration, will again become the financial law of the Church through which we will properly take care of the poor. Until that time, it is our responsibility and blessing\u2014as a matter of fact, our covenant\u2014to give generously from our surplus to bless the poor.\nWe stress the teaching of personal and family preparedness as the first principle of the welfare services program. It is, therefore, incumbent upon each stake president and bishop to make sure that excessive financial demands are not made upon the people which will weaken their financial security and make it impossible for them to take care of their own needs.\nMay the Lord bless us to be wise and sound stewards in blessing the people with our teachings and our leadership, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nVictor L.

Presidents of the Church called members on missions with no warning beforehand. I feel the same way today.\nIt\u2019s a long way from Switzerland to this stand in Salt Lake City. I had to cross many borders. I had to ask for a visa, for permission to enter this country. But I found out that wherever I had to cross a border or had to talk with people, the people were friendly.

Ringger\nThe Answers Will Come\n1985\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "President Arch Monson: President Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, distinguished guests, brother Scouts and Scouters, it is a great privilege and honor for me to be here in this renowned spiritual center on this momentous occasion. As president of the Boy Scouts of America, I bring you greetings on behalf of our executive board and tell you that we are pleased to be represented at this great meeting of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nI feel that as we meet on this great occasion that once again we should recognize the long and distinguished partnership between the Boy Scouts of America and your church. Since 1913 the Mormon Church has used the Scouting program as an integral part of its ministry to boys and young men. This unique relationship has been possible because of a close alignment of the goals and objectives between Scouting and the Church: namely, character building, citizenship training, personal fitness, and spiritual growth. We must pay a great tribute to those early Church leaders who in their great wisdom saw methods in the Scouting programs which, when properly applied, would bring youth into a closer and more meaningful relationship with their God and their fellowmen.\nThis is the real merit of the Scouting program. It can be adapted by community organizations\u2014such as churches, service groups, civic clubs, and schools\u2014and used by these organizations to help them achieve their aims for their young people. The methods of Scouting provide a most effective means whereby boys can learn self-reliance, teamwork, duty to God and country, and respect for the beliefs and convictions of others\u2014all by subscribing to the Scout Oath and Law and supporting it. In this way they develop a code of ethics and a sense of values by which they pattern their lives.\nIn combination with other programs of the church and community, Scouting provides a genuine context for Christian living. In my travels around the Scouting world, I am continually impressed by the effectiveness with which the Mormon Church uses the Scouting program in cooperation with the various Scout associations. As a worldwide movement, Scouting lays a vital role in promoting world brotherhood and understanding; and even on the global scene, Scouting helps the Church achieve its aims.\nI would, before continuing, like to thank you for sharing with us in my administration the fine leadership of President Ezra Taft Benson, Elder Thomas Monson, Elder Marion Hanks, and, through this long period of partnership, many others who have been so helpful in our national Scouting program.\nI would like at this time to ask Mr. William Jackson, who is chairman of the relationship division of the Boy Scouts of America, and also Mr. James Sands, who is director of the international division of the Boy Scouts of America, to join me here at the podium. Will you gentlemen please come forward?\nToday we pay tribute to your esteemed president, whose support and sincere belief in Scouting continue to make this fine relationship possible. President Kimball, would you please come forward? Spencer Woolley Kimball, world religious leader, author, humanitarian, friend of Scouting, the Boy Scouts of America salute you and confer upon you the Silver World Award, our highest honor for distinguished service to youth on a global basis. You, sir, are recognized among distinguished citizens of the world who have contributed so substantially to the spirit of unity and brotherhood among the youth of over 113 nations of this great world. We are honored to make this presentation.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball: Thank you very much. I think I would like to ask all the Scouts in this room to please stand a moment. [Most of the audience stood.] Thank you very much.\nI deeply appreciate this recognition and this act of courtesy on the part of the Boy Scouts of America. I have enjoyed a long and respectful relationship with Scouting. I believe in its potential to motivate young men to live with effectiveness and integrity and to help them prepare for their manhood. There are some lines from a poet that reflect my feelings about boys:\nNobody knows what a boy is worth,\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nBut every man in a noble place,\nA boy once used to be.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands firm in its commitment to youth, to the families to which they belong, to the families they themselves will one day form, and to every program and effort that seek to build and strengthen and enrich and ennoble youth. The Boy Scouts of America has for many years found sponsorship in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Since in 1913, we became the first partner to sponsor Scouting in the United States. We have remained strong and firm in our support of this great movement for boys and of the Oath and the Law which are at its center. To commit a boy to do his best\u2014to do his duty to God, to his country, to his fellowmen, to true principles, and to himself\u2014is to open avenues of vision and direction for him which can be critically important in his life. A young man who understands and is fully committed to the great principles of the Scout Law has his feet firmly planted on a path that can lead to a happy and constructive life. He will qualify for his own self-respect, and he will very likely form wholesome relationships with others and will establish an honorable family. Being true to Scout principles will help him in forming a companionship with his Heavenly Father that will strengthen all the other relationships and aspects of life. It is our understanding and belief that Scouting is still strongly centered in these duties and principles, and that there is a determination in its present leadership to strengthen them further. This being true, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints affirms the continued support of Scouting and will seek to provide leadership which will help boys keep close to their families and close to the Church as they develop the qualities of citizenship and character and fitness which Scouting represents.\nAgain, I thank you sincerely for this award.\nMr. Arch Monson\nPresentation of Scouting Award\n1977\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brethren of the priesthood, it is sincerely a great pleasure to stand before you this evening and share with you the feelings and gratitude that I have, to know that God lives and that he loves us, that Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother and Savior, and that there is a prophet on the earth that can authoritatively say, \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d I treat with great reverence and humility the fact that the Lord has called me to serve as a Seventy and to witness to the world that Jesus is the Christ, and I will do my very best to move the work ahead, wherever I am assigned to labor.\nI would like to speak to you about the importance of service in the kingdom of God and the importance of full-time mission service in the lives of our young men and older couples.\nWithout appearing to be self-serving, I would like to tell you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood a little about my call to a full-time mission. The year was 1962, and a call was received from President David O. McKay to serve in the Mexican Mission. Shortly after receiving the call, I learned that I had bone cancer in my right arm and that the probability of my living many weeks was extremely low. A blessing was received from a wonderful father, wherein he blessed me with my life and that the mission call would be fulfilled, and that I would have a family and be able to serve the Lord all my days.\nThe doctor congratulated me on being one who had great faith in the Savior but assured me that I didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of what I had. As some of you have noticed, I only have one arm as a result of that problem; but ten months after having my arm amputated, I entered the Mexican Mission, full of excitement and ready to work. You see, young men, I had several years earlier committed to the Lord that I would serve a full-time mission and that I would not let anything stop me from fulfilling that call. Well, brethren, the doctor passed away twenty years ago, always amazed to see me still breathing, and he actually became quite interested in the Church.\nBrethren, I want you to know that having one arm for nearly thirty years has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. It hasn\u2019t been my greatest challenge, but it has been a great teacher to me, teaching me to be more patient and tolerant with others as I have had to learn to be more patient with myself. It has helped me to understand the necessity of our having challenges in life to help develop our character and stamina, helping us to become what the Lord ultimately wants us to become.\nOur challenges may be physical, spiritual, economic, or emotional, but if we will treat them as opportunities and stepping-stones in our progress, rather than barriers and stumbling blocks, our lives and growth will be wonderful. I have learned that between challenges it is very restful but that any real growth that I have ever enjoyed has always come with a challenge.\nThere\u2019s a little poem by an unknown author that we might think about when problems come our way. It is called \u201cThe Oyster.\u201d\nThere once was an oyster\nWhose story I\u2019ll tell,\nWho found that some sand\nHad worked under his shell.\nJust one little grain\nBut it gave him a pain,\nFor oysters have feelings\nThat are very plain.\nNow did he berate\nThis working of fate,\nThat left him in such a\nDeplorable state?\nDid he curse the government,\nCall for an election,\nAnd say that the sea\nShould have some protection?\nNo! He said to himself\nAs he sat on the shelf,\n\u201cSince I cannot remove it,\nI think I\u2019ll improve it.\u201d\nWell, years passed by,\nAs years always do,\nTill he came to his destiny,\nOyster stew!\nBut the small grain of sand\nThat bothered him so\nWas a beautiful pearl\nAll richly aglow.\nNow this tale has a moral,\nFor isn\u2019t it grand,\nWhat an oyster can do\nWith a small grain of sand?\nAnd what couldn\u2019t we do\nIf we\u2019d only begin\nWith all of the things\nThat get under our skin?\nYoung men, how are you going to meet the challenges that face you and that might jeopardize an opportunity to serve? It might be vocational opportunities, a car, a girlfriend, an assorted variety of sins, or a myriad of other reasons. For the older brethren, it might be a yacht, camper, fishing plans, or maybe not wanting to miss some expected weddings and births. Whatever your individual challenges might be, I would invite you this very night to get on your knees and commit to your Heavenly Father that you will not allow anything to stop you from fulfilling that wonderful opportunity to serve a full-time mission. If you haven\u2019t been called, let your bishop know of your desire to serve.\nWhen in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew the Lord said, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\u201d (Matt. 25:40), he was talking about the importance of being of service to our fellowmen if we want to be worthy of his presence. What better way could there be to serve and to sacrifice than to accept a full-time mission call? At the same time, please realize that there are some handicaps and limitations that make other types of local service more practical than serving a full-time mission.\nIn the priesthood session of April conference, Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, \u201cNow, my brethren, \u2018these are [your] days\u2019 (Hel. 7:9) in the history of the Church.\u201d (Ensign, May 1992, p. 39.) Yes, my young brethren, these are your days, to be a part of 50,000, 75,000, and 100,000 missionaries serving in the army of the Lord, armed with peace, righteousness, and power.\nWhile presiding over the Mexico City North Mission in the late seventies, we decided to open the work in an area called the Huasteca, where there was only one Latter-day Saint family in a vast area with several communities and small cities. After two years, there were 500 members of the Church in five branches and an organized district. This was done by a handful of nineteen- and twenty-year-old faithful missionaries and two wonderful couples, who gave of themselves to see that others of Heavenly Father\u2019s children might know and understand.\nAfter the missionaries had been in the Huasteca for about three weeks, we received a phone call from one of them, and we could tell that he was slightly discouraged, not having yet received any mail, being in a hot area with high humidity, and learning about a culture that was new to all of us. After we had talked for a minute or two, I reminded him that we had talked about the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be easy. He said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, President; that\u2019s right. It wouldn\u2019t be easy. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d Well, he went ahead with great enthusiasm and concluded his very successful work there and was released to return home. A couple of months later, while he was at BYU, he and some of his former companions called Sister Dickson and me at the mission home in Mexico City at 2:30 in the morning, waking us from a very sound sleep. After a short conversation, I mentioned the fact that it was wonderful to talk with them but that it seemed a little late at night to be calling. He said, \u201cI know, President, but you knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nBrethren, life is not intended to be easy, but I promise those that labor faithfully in the service of their fellowmen, and with determination handle every challenge properly and under the influence of the Spirit, that they will be blessed with feelings of happiness which will permeate their whole souls, and these, my brethren, are blessings that mold and build us and that can never be taken away.\nI leave you with my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of the Lord, Jesus Christ and my testimony of the blessings which accompany unselfish service and hard work that is done in his holy name, and I say it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJohn B. Dickson\nNobody Said That It Would Be Easy\n1992\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "On July 26, 1847, their third day in the valley (the second having been the Sabbath), Brigham Young, with members of the Twelve and some others, climbed a peak about one and a half miles from where I now stand. They thought it a good place to raise an ensign to the nations. Heber C. Kimball wore a yellow bandana. They tied it to Willard Richards\u2019s walking stick and waved it aloft, an ensign to the nations. Brigham Young named it Ensign Peak.1\nThen they descended to their worn-out wagons, to the few things they had carried 2,000 miles, and to their travel-weary followers. It was not what they possessed that gave them strength but what they knew.\nThey knew they were Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. They knew that the priesthood had been delivered to them by angelic messengers. They knew they had the commandments and the covenants to offer opportunity for the eternal salvation and exaltation for all mankind. They were sure that the inspiration of the Holy Ghost attended them.\nThey busied themselves plowing up gardens, putting up shelters against the winter soon to come. They prepared for others already on the prairie following them to this new gathering place.\nA revelation, written nine years earlier, directed them to \u201carise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;\n\u201cAnd that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth\u201d (D&C 115:5\u20136).\nThey were to be the \u201clight,\u201d the \u201cstandard.\u201d\nThe standard, established by revelation, is contained in the scriptures through the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The principles of the gospel life we follow are based on doctrine, and the standards accord with the principles. We are bound to the standards by covenant, as administered through the ordinances of the gospel by those who have received priesthood and the keys of authority.\nThose faithful Brethren were not free, and we are not free, to alter the standards or to ignore them. We must live by them.\nIt is not a cure or a comfort to simply say they do not matter. We all know they do matter, for all mankind is \u201cinstructed sufficiently that they know good from evil\u201d (2 Nephi 2:5).\nIf we are doing the best we can, we should not become discouraged. When we fall short, as we do, or stumble, which we might, there is always the remedy of repentance and forgiveness.\nWe are to teach our children the moral standard to avoid every kind of immorality. The precious powers within their mortal bodies \u201care to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\u201d2 We must be completely faithful in marriage.\nWe are to keep the law of tithing. We attend to our responsibilities in the Church. We gather each week for sacrament meeting to renew the covenants and earn the promises in those simple and sacred prayers over the bread and water. We are to honor the priesthood and be obedient to the covenants and ordinances.\nThose Brethren on Ensign Peak knew that they were to live ordinary lives and keep the image of Christ engraven in their countenances (see Alma 5:14).\nThey understood that the stakes were to be a defense and a refuge, but at that time there was not one stake on the earth. They knew their mission was to establish stakes of Zion in every nation of the earth.\nPerhaps they wondered what kind of wrath or storm could be poured out that they had not already experienced. They had endured savage opposition, violence, terrorism. Their homes had been burned, their property taken. They were driven from their homes time after time after time. They knew then, as we know now, that there would be no end to opposition. The nature of it changes, but it never ends. There would be no end to the kinds of challenges that the early Saints would face. New challenges would be different than, but certainly not less than, that through which they had made their way.\nNow the stakes of Zion number in the thousands and are all over the world. The members number in the millions and growing. Neither of these can be held back, for this is the work of the Lord. Now members live in 160 nations and speak over 200 languages.\nSome live with an unspoken fear of what awaits us and the Church in the world. It grows ever darker in morality and spirituality. If we will gather into the Church, live the simple principles of the gospel, live moral lives, keep the Word of Wisdom, tend to our priesthood and other duties, then we need not live in fear. The Word of Wisdom is a key to both physical health and revelation. Avoid tea, coffee, liquor, tobacco, and narcotics.\nWe can live where we wish, doing the best we can to make a living, whether modest or generous. We are free to do as we wish with our lives, assured of the approval and even the intervention of the Almighty, confident of constant spiritual guidance.\nEach stake is a defense and a refuge and a standard. A stake is self-contained with all that is needed for the salvation and exaltation of those who would come within its influence, and temples are ever closer.\nThere has been no end to opposition. There are misinterpretations and misrepresentations of us and of our history, some of it mean-spirited and certainly contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Sometimes clergy, even ministerial organizations, oppose us. They do what we would never do. We do not attack or criticize or oppose others as they do us.\nEven today there are those preposterous stories handed down and repeated so many times they are believed. One of the silliest of them is that Mormons have horns.\nYears ago, I was at a symposium at a college in Oregon. Present were a Catholic bishop, a rabbi, an Episcopalian minister, an Evangelical minister, a Unitarian clergyman, and myself.\nThe president of the school, Dr. Bennett, hosted a breakfast. One of them asked which wife I had brought. I told them I had a choice of one. For a second, I thought that I was being singled out for embarrassment. Then someone asked the Catholic bishop if he had brought his wife.\nThe next question came from Dr. Bennett to me: \u201cIs it true that Mormons have horns?\u201d\nI smiled and said, \u201cI comb my hair so that they can\u2019t be seen.\u201d\nDr. Bennett, who was completely bald, put both hands on the top of his head and said, \u201cOh! You can never make a Mormon out of me!\u201d\nStrangest of all, otherwise intelligent people claim we are not Christian. This shows that they know little or nothing about us. It is a true principle that you cannot lift yourself by putting others down.\nSome suppose that our high standards will repel growth. It is just the opposite. High standards are a magnet. We are all children of God, drawn to the truth and to good.\nWe face the challenge of raising families in the world in darkening clouds of wickedness. Some of our members are unsettled, and sometimes they wonder: Is there any place one can go to escape from it all? Is there another town or a state or a country where it is safe, where one can find refuge? The answer generally is no. The defense and the refuge is where our members now live.\nThe Book of Mormon prophesies, \u201cYea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance\u201d (3 Nephi 21:28).\nThose who come out of the world into the Church, keep the commandments, honor the priesthood, and enter into activity have found the refuge.\nA few weeks ago in one of our meetings, Elder Robert C. Oaks, one of the seven Presidents of the Seventy (a retired four-star general and commander of NATO air forces in Central Europe), reminded us of an accord signed by 10 nations on board the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, which ended World War II. Some of us were in Asia at the time. Said Elder (General) Oaks: \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine a circumstance today in which such a meeting could be held or such an accord could be signed to end the war against terrorism and wickedness in which we are engaged. It is not that kind of war.\u201d\nWe are not to be afraid, even in a world where the hostilities will never end. The war of opposition that was prophesied in the revelations continues today. We are to be happy and positive. We are not to be afraid. Fear is the opposite of faith.\nWe know that activity in the Church centers in the family. Wherever members are in the world, they should establish a family where children are welcome and treasured as \u201can heritage of the Lord\u201d (Psalm 127:3). A worthy Latter-day Saint family is a standard to the world.\nNot only are we to maintain the highest of standards, but each of us is to be a standard, a defense, a refuge. We are to \u201clet [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works, and glorify [our] Father which is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16; see also 3 Nephi 12:16).\nAll the struggles and exertions of past generations have brought to us in our day the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the authority to administer, and the wherewithal to accomplish the ministry. It all comes together in this dispensation of the fulness of times, in the which the consummation of all things will be completed and the earth prepared for the coming of the Lord.\nWe are as much a part of this work as were those men who untied that yellow bandana from Willard Richards\u2019s walking stick and descended from Ensign Peak. That bandana, waved aloft, signaled the great gathering which had been prophesied in ancient and modern scriptures.\nWe speak of the Church as our refuge, our defense. There is safety and protection in the Church. It centers in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Latter-day Saints learn to look within themselves to see the redeeming power of the Savior of all mankind. The principles of the gospel taught in the Church and learned from the scriptures become a guide for each of us individually and for our families.\nWe know that the homes we establish, and those of our descendants, will be the refuge spoken of in the revelations\u2014the \u201clight,\u201d the \u201cstandard,\u201d the \u201censign\u201d for all nations, and the \u201crefuge\u201d against the gathering storms (see D&C 115:5\u20136; Isaiah 11:12; 2 Nephi 21:12).\nThe ensign to which all of us are to rally is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father, whose Church this is and whose name we bear and whose authority we carry.\nWe look forward with faith. We have seen many events in our lifetime, and many will yet occur that will tax our courage and extend our faith. We are to \u201crejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [will be our] reward in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:12).\nWillingly defend the history of the Church, and do \u201cnot [be] ashamed of the gospel of [Jesus] Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth\u201d (Romans 1:16).\nWe will face the challenges, for we cannot avoid them, and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ and teach of Him as our Savior and our Refuge, our Redeemer.\nIf a well-worn yellow bandana was good enough to be an ensign to the world, then ordinary men who hold the priesthood and ordinary women and ordinary children in ordinary families, living the gospel as best they can all over the world, can shine forth as a standard, a defense, a refuge against whatever is to be poured out upon the earth.\n\u201cWe talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins\u201d (2 Nephi 25:26).\nThis Church will prosper. It will prevail. Of this I am absolutely certain. I bear this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBoyd K. Packer\nA Defense and a Refuge\n2006\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "It was two years ago, my brothers and sisters, when I was called to be an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve. These years have brought new challenges and many choice and wonderful experiences. Today I should like to begin my message by expressing gratitude to my Father in heaven, to the leaders of the Church, and to my loved ones, for their confidence in me and for their support and sustaining hand.\nNow I have received a new assignment from the First Presidency, to preside over the Florida South Mission. Along with my call, a call was issued to Sister Bennett to serve at my side as my companion and to be the supervisor of the activities of the women and children in the mission. We are deeply grateful for this call and accept it without reservations. It is our desire to direct the affairs of the mission in accordance with the instructions of the First Presidency. We ask for an interest in your faith and prayers.\nAs I thought about what I might say today, I reminded myself of the mission of the Church and the purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Specifically, my mind went back to some statements made by the Savior. In the Pearl of Great Price we read, \u201cFor behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d (Moses 1:39.)\nThen in his Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said, \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (Matt. 5:38.) In these words I find an expression of hope and confidence as well as a challenge from our Savior.\nI then thought about how the Church and the gospel can help men and women in reaching these great objectives. The words of President David O. McKay came to mind: \u201cThe purpose of the gospel is to make bad men good and good men better\u2014to change men\u2019s lives.\u201d\nI also contemplated the day-to-day operations of the Church and the performance of Church members in the stakes, wards, and missions as revealed in stake activity reports, genealogy reports, mission reports, etc.; and I realized that, while the Church and its members have moved forward and upward in many ways, there is much more that needs to be done.\nIt has been my privilege to tour a number of the full-time missions. I have also witnessed firsthand the work of many stake missions. As I have done so, I have become keenly aware of two great needs that should receive attention if we are to raise performance in missionary work both at home and abroad.\nFirst, members of the Church everywhere should remind themselves that the gospel is to be preached and taught by example and not just by word of mouth. The lives of all Church members should be shining examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ in action.\nSecond, as members of the Church, it is our responsibility to assist the missionaries in finding investigators to whom the message of the gospel can be taught. The missionary program needs the help of all of us\u2014young and old\u2014and it needs our help now.\n\u201cThere are chances for work all around just now,\nOpportunities right in our way;\nDo not let them pass by, saying,\n\u2018Sometime I\u2019ll try,\u2019\nBut go and do something today.\n\u201c\u2019Tis noble of man to work and to give,\nLove\u2019s labor has merit alone;\nOnly he who does something is worthy to live,\nThe world has no use for the drone.\n\u201cThen wake up, and do something more\nThan dream of your mansion above;\nDoing good is a pleasure; a joy beyond measure,\nA blessing of duty and love.\u201d\n\u2014Hymns, no. 58\nThere are opportunities all around us if we are but alert to them. To illustrate this, I should like to share with you several personal experiences I have had over the years that bear this out and that have strengthened my own testimony, enriched my life, and enabled me to explain the gospel to others.\nThe question, \u201cWhat is the main obstacle to success in stake missionary work?\u201d was asked by President S. Dilworth Young of a group of stake missionaries in the East Cache Stake some years ago. A lady missionary\u2019s prompt reply was, \u201cThe failure of too many Latter-day Saints to live the gospel as Latter-day Saints should.\u201d\nAs I have attended stake conferences, I have observed that this also applies to other stakes in the Church. We can and ought to do something to change this situation. We can change it by letting our lives be shining examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ in action.\nDuring World War II, while serving with the 31st Infantry Division in the Dutch East Indies, I was placed in command of a patrol charged with the responsibility of searching out and destroying enemy supply bases.\nAs we proceeded on one particular patrol behind enemy lines, a native dog fell in with our group; and try as we would, we couldn\u2019t get that dog to leave. I became concerned about this. Later on, however, its alertness caused us to be suspicious to the point where we took extra precautions as we proceeded on to lower ground after coming to a fork in the trail. Therefore, when the enemy opened fire shortly thereafter, we were not caught completely by surprise. Four men were wounded in the initial burst of fire, but not a single man lost his life. We were able to evacuate the wounded and withdraw to the rear under heavy machine gun and rifle fire without losing a single man.\nSergeant Leslie E. Milam of Natchitoches, Louisiana, the only other Mormon in my company, was with me on this patrol. After we returned to the rear, he was contacted by Sergeant Dabbs, our platoon guide, who said that he was aware that Sergeant Milam and I had been meeting on Sundays, whenever conditions would permit, for short religious discussions. He indicated that he knew that our lives had been miraculously saved in this patrol, and he requested permission to meet with us in our next religious discussion. He did meet with us, and he was just as sincere as we were in expressing gratitude to our Father in heaven for his protection and watchful care.\nShortly after this ambush, Private Collins, who went through the ambush with us, sought me out one night after dark and said, \u201cLieutenant Bennett, I think we had some help from on high out there the other day.\u201d\nI replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know just how you feel about it, Collins, or how the other boys feel; but as far as I\u2019m concerned, I know we did.\u201d\nHe then said, \u201cAnd I know we did, Lieutenant Bennett, and there is something else I want to say. I\u2019ve been a rough character in the past. I\u2019ve done most of the things I shouldn\u2019t have done, but it\u2019s going to be different in the future. I\u2019m a changed man.\u201d\nI have thought about this choice experience many times, for it provided me with a great opportunity to explain the gospel message to Private Collins under conditions where his heart and his mind were open.\nJust prior to going overseas during World War II, while we were on maneuvers in the Louisiana-Texas area, my platoon sergeant, Sergeant Tiffin, came to me during a ten-minute break and said, \u201cLieutenant Bennett, you know and I know that we will be going overseas in the near future, and that when we go overseas it will not be long until we find ourselves in combat. When we get into combat, sooner or later some of us will be required to take the life of one or more of the enemy. I have been taught that if this should happen, I will be held responsible for the blood which I shed, even though I am a victim of circumstance. This is bothering me. Lieutenant, I know that you are a Mormon. What does your church teach regarding this matter?\u201d\nWhat an excellent opportunity for me to share with Sergeant Tiffin the statement of the First Presidency to all LDS servicemen throughout the world, which statement was part of the servicemen\u2019s kit given to each LDS soldier who entered military service. Similar instructions are found in the servicemen\u2019s kits that are made available to our servicemen today.\nFor the balance of that day, whenever we had a ten-minute break, Sergeant Tiffin and I continued the discussion. Each time we met, he brought others with him; and when we went into the bivouac area at night, the discussions continued into the wee hours. What a tremendous opportunity to share the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ!\nOne evening on board ship, while sailing from Yokohama, Japan, to Seattle, Washington, after the end of World War II, I began talking to the officer in the bunk next to me about the Book of Mormon. He was not a member of the Church, but he lived in the Worland, Wyoming, area, and so he knew quite a bit about the Mormons. We had a lengthy but interesting discussion.\nThe next morning the officer in the bunk above me, who had listened the night before but hadn\u2019t joined in the discussion, came to me and said, \u201cWhere can I get a copy of that Book of Mormon you were talking about last night?\u201d\nI said, \u201cGive me your address, and I\u2019ll send you a copy just as soon as I return to Salt Lake City.\u201d\nI sent it along with a few tracts and had his name referred to the missionaries, that he might be contacted.\nWhile I was touring the South Africa Mission a little over a year ago, President Harlan Clark and I boarded the plane at Johannesburg to fly to Port Elizabeth, there to meet with the missionaries. President Clark took a seat next to a businessman, and I took one next to a nurse. We both received referrals, which were passed on to the missionaries for appropriate follow-up.\nA few years ago I was assigned to the Tampa Stake conference in Florida. I had to change planes in Chicago. As I boarded the plane after making the change, I found that I had been assigned a seat next to a young lady who was very busily engaged in reading the newspaper. When I sat down, I did not disturb her. But all at once she said, \u201cThis is disgusting.\u201d\nI replied, \u201cWhat is disgusting?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cThe point of view that so many people have today that they should look to the government to satisfy every want and need.\u201d\nI responded, \u201cYou must be a Mormon.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a Mormon,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I have heard about the welfare program of the Mormon Church, and I think it is just wonderful.\u201d\nThis too provided an opportunity to explain the gospel. Before I reached my destination, she had given me her name and address and permission to send her a copy of the Book of Mormon, some Church welfare pamphlets, and other Church literature.\nThese examples of true experiences in my life indicate that the door is wide open and that many opportunities are available for doing missionary work \u2014if we are just alert and will put forth a little effort. The joys associated with going the extra mile to open the door and reach the hearts of people with respect to the gospel message can be illustrated by quoting a few sentences from a letter I received from a friend of mine just a few months ago:\n\u201cI love the gospel very much. My testimony is my most prized possession, and I couldn\u2019t live without it. My greatest happiness has been through participating in Church activities \u2026 and in missionary work. I have served for seven years as a stake missionary, and I have supported a total of eight full-time missionaries in the field. I have a special love for missionary work.\u201d\nMay we all feel more dedicated to this great, unselfish service of love that we refer to as missionary work, and may we be willing in our hearts to make a greater contribution to its forward progress.\nI bear you my testimony that this work is true. God lives, and his Son Jesus Christ is indeed our Savior, the Redeemer of mankind. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church, and I bear you this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nWilliam H. Bennett\nBe A Missionary\u2014Always\u2014Everywhere You Go!\n1972\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 5:10 PM\nQuorums of the Seventy\nQuorums of the Seventy\nSeventy is an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood. Since 1986,\nmembers of the Quorums of the Seventy are general or regional\nauthorities who assist in the administration of the Church across the\nworld. For most of the history of the Church, however, stakes had their\nown quorums of seventy.\nThe first members of the seventy were ordained on February 28, 1835,\nwhen Joseph Smith began to call and ordain special missionaries to\n\u201cprune the vineyard for the last time.\u201d\n1\nThat same month, Oliver\nCowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris assisted Joseph Smith in\nselecting Twelve Apostles, a priesthood quorum of twelve high priests\nwho, like the Apostles in the New Testament, were commissioned to\npreach the gospel to all the world. According to an instruction on\npriesthood included in the Doctrine and Covenants, the seventy too\nwere \u201ccalled to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the\nGentiles and in all the world,\u201d modeled after the Seventy whom Jesus\ncalled to preach to the Israelites during His lifetime.\n2\nThe instruction also explained that the seventy \u201cform a quorum, equal\nin authority to that of the Twelve\u201d but that the seventy were to act\nunder the direction of the Apostles, who alone held the \u201ckeys\u201d to\nproclaim the gospel to both Jew and Gentile.\n3\nAdditional quorums of seventy were created as additional men were\nordained. After Joseph Smith\u2019s death in 1844, most elders under the age\nof 35 were ordained as seventies, and many new quorums were created\nto accommodate the expanding ranks. By 1846, the number of quorums\nof seventy had reached 35. Eventually the total number of quorums\nreached into the hundreds. Most missionaries during the second half of\nthe 19th century were members of these local quorums of seventy.\n4\nA\ncouncil of seven selected from among each quorum\u2019s members presided\nover a quorum. As a whole, the quorums of seventy were presided over\nby seven men who constituted the First Council of the Seventy. These\nmen were sustained as General Authorities next to the Quorum of the\nTwelve in authority. In 1907, Joseph F. Smith taught that the First\nCouncil of the Seventy functioned as \u201cassistants to the Twelve Apostles\u201d\nand were, in one sense, \u201capostles of the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d sent to\npreach the gospel throughout the world.\n5\nAs Church membership expanded across the globe, it became difficult\nfor the Twelve to fulfill all of their administrative responsibilities. In\n1941, the First Presidency began to call a few men as \u201cassistants to the\ntwelve.\u201d In 1961, President David O. McKay directed that members of\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/quorum-of-the-seventy?lang=eng\n1/34/8/23, 5:10 PM\nQuorums of the Seventy\nthe First Council of Seventy be ordained to the office of high priest and\ngiven the authority necessary to \u201cset in order all things pertaining to the\nstake and the wards, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles.\u201d\n6\nIn\nOctober 1975, President Spencer W. Kimball announced the creation of\nthe First Quorum of Seventy as an additional body of General\nAuthorities, and filled the quorum with the First Council of Seventy, the\nAssistants to the Twelve, and other newly called Seventies. In October\n1986, President Ezra Taft Benson directed local leaders to discontinue\nlocal quorums of the seventy and no longer call and ordain men to the\noffice of seventy. Leaders then either directed former members of the\nlocal quorums of the seventy to attend elders quorums or ordained\nthem as high priests.\nSince 1986, the office of Seventy has remained an office of general and\narea authority rather than local authority. Members of the Seventy\ngenerally retire from active service at age 70, at which time they are\ngranted emeritus status. The founding of a \u201cFirst\u201d Quorum of Seventy\nrenewed the pattern of Quorums of the Seventy seen during the earliest\ndays of the Church, only on a general as opposed to a local level. In\nApril 1989, the Second Quorum of Seventy was established. In 1995,\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley announced the discontinuation of\nregional representatives to the Twelve and the introduction of local\nofficers, initially called \u201cArea Authorities\u201d and later redesignated \u201cArea\nAuthority Seventies\u201d and, after 2005, \u201cArea Seventies.\u201d\n7\nBetween 1997\nand 2004, the First Presidency called Area Authority Seventies to the\nThird through Fifth Quorums and placed them under the direction of\nthe First Quorum of the Seventy. Adjustments to quorums and the\ncreation of additional quorums continued.\n8\nIn 2020, the First\nPresidency announced four new quorums, bringing the total number of\nquorums of the Seventy to twelve.\n9\nThe Seventy today support the Quorum of the Twelve and First\nPresidency in administering the Church throughout the world, serving\nas members of Area Presidencies, organizing stakes, and teaching\nLatter-day Saints in general and local conference settings.\nChurch Resources\nEarl C.

As I have expressed gratitude to my Heavenly Father for these marvelous blessings and opportunities, I have realized, perhaps more than ever before, how critical the formative years of my life were.\nMany of the most important and life-changing moments of my life occurred when I was a young man. The lessons I learned then formed my character and shaped my destiny. Without them, I would be a very different man and in a very different place than I am today. This evening, I would like to talk for a few minutes about some of these experiences and what I learned from them.\nI\u2019ll never forget one high school football game against a rival school. I played the wingback position, and my assignment was to either block the linebacker or try to get open so the quarterback could throw me the ball. The reason I remember this particular game so well is because the fellow on the other side of the line\u2014the man I was supposed to block\u2014was a giant.\nI wasn\u2019t exactly the tallest athlete in the world. But I think this other guy may have been. I remember looking up at him, thinking he probably weighed as much as two of me. Keep in mind, when I played we didn\u2019t have the protective gear that players have today. My helmet was made of leather, and it didn\u2019t have a face guard.\nThe more I thought about it, the more I came to a sobering realization: if I ever let him catch me, I could be cheering for my team the rest of the season from a hospital bed.\nLucky for me, I was fast. And for the better part of the first half, I managed to avoid him.\nExcept for one play.\nOur quarterback dropped back to pass. I was open. He threw the ball, and it sailed towards me.\nThe only problem was that I could hear a lumbering gallop behind me. In a moment of clarity, I thought that if I caught the ball there was a distinct possibility I could be eating my meals through a tube. But the ball was heading for me, and my team was depending on me. So I reached out, and\u2014at the last instant\u2014I looked up.\nAnd there he was.\nI remember the ball hitting my hands. I remember struggling to hang on to it. I remember the sound of the ball falling to the turf. After that, I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened, because the giant hit me so hard I wasn\u2019t sure what planet I was on. One thing I did remember was a deep voice coming from behind a dark haze: \u201cServes you right for being on the wrong team.\u201d\nWilliam McKinley Oswald was my high school football coach. He was a great coach and had a profound influence on my life. But I think he could have learned his method of motivating players from an army drill sergeant.\nThat day, during his half-time speech, Coach Oswald reminded the whole team about the pass I had dropped. Then he pointed right at me and said, \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t speaking with his inside voice.\n\u201cI want to know what made you drop that pass.\u201d\nI stammered for a moment and then finally decided to tell the truth. \u201cI took my eye off the ball,\u201d I said.\nThe coach looked at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right; you took your eye off the ball. Don\u2019t ever do that again. That kind of mistake loses ball games.\u201d\nI respected Coach Oswald, and in spite of how terrible I felt, I made up my mind to do what Coach said. I vowed to never take my eye off the ball again, even if it meant getting pounded to Mongolia by the giant on the other side of the line.\nWe headed back onto the field and started the second half. It was a close game, and even though my team had played well, we were behind by four points late in the fourth quarter.\nThe quarterback called my number on the next play. I went out again, and again I was open. The ball headed towards me. But this time, the giant was in front of me and in perfect position to intercept the pass.\nHe reached up, but the ball sailed through his hands. I jumped high, never taking my eye off the ball; stabbed at it; and pulled it down for the game-winning touchdown.\nI don\u2019t remember much about the celebration after, but I do remember the look on Coach Oswald\u2019s face.\n\u201cWay to keep your eye on the ball,\u201d he said.\nI think I smiled for a week.\nI have known many great men and women. Although they have different backgrounds, talents, and perspectives, they all have this in common: they work diligently and persistently towards achieving their goals. It\u2019s easy to get distracted and lose focus on the things that are most important in life. I\u2019ve tried to remember the lessons I learned from Coach Oswald and prioritize values that are important to me so that I can keep my eye focused on things that really matter.\nI urge you to examine your life. Determine where you are and what you need to do to be the kind of person you want to be. Create inspiring, noble, and righteous goals that fire your imagination and create excitement in your heart. And then keep your eye on them. Work consistently towards achieving them.\n\u201cIf one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,\u201d wrote Henry David Thoreau, \u201cand endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.\u201d1\nIn other words, never take your eye off the ball.\nAnother lesson I learned on the football field was at the bottom of a pile of 10 other players. It was the Rocky Mountain Conference championship game, and the play called for me to run the ball up the middle to score the go-ahead touchdown. I took the handoff and plunged into the line. I knew I was close to the goal line, but I didn\u2019t know how close. Although I was pinned at the bottom of the pile, I reached my fingers forward a couple of inches and I could feel it. The goal line was two inches away.\nAt that moment I was tempted to push the ball forward. I could have done it. And when the refs finally pulled the players off the pile, I would have been a hero. No one would have ever known.\nI had dreamed of this moment from the time I was a boy. And it was right there within my reach. But then I remembered the words of my mother. \u201cJoseph,\u201d she had often said to me, \u201cdo what is right, no matter the consequence. Do what is right and things will turn out OK.\u201d\nI wanted so desperately to score that touchdown. But more than being a hero in the eyes of my friends, I wanted to be a hero in the eyes of my mother. And so I left the ball where it was\u2014two inches from the goal line.\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was a defining experience. Had I moved the ball, I could have been a champion for a moment, but the reward of temporary glory would have carried with it too steep and too lasting a price. It would have engraved upon my conscience a scar that would have stayed with me the remainder of my life. I knew I must do what is right.\nThe Light of Christ helps us to discern right from wrong. When we allow temptations to drown out the still voice of our conscience\u2014that is when decisions become difficult.\nMy parents taught me to react quickly when temptation comes and to say \u201cNo!\u201d instantly and emphatically. I recommend that same counsel to you. Avoid temptations.\nAnother lesson I learned was the joy of service to others. I have spoken before of how my father, who was the bishop of our ward, had me load up my wagon and deliver needed food and supplies to the homes of those families who were in need. He wasn\u2019t alone in his desire to reach out to those in distress.\nSeventy-five years ago, Bishop William F. Perschon presided over the Fourth Ward of the Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City. He was a German immigrant, a convert to the Church, and he spoke with a thick accent. He was a fine businessman, but what most distinguished him was his great compassion for others.\nEach week during priesthood meeting, Bishop Perschon had the Aaronic Priesthood bearers recite the following phrase: \u201cPriesthood means service; bearing the priesthood, I will serve.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t merely a slogan. When widows needed assistance, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there to help. When a chapel was being built, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there. When the sugar beets and potatoes at the welfare farm needed weeding or harvesting, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there.\nLater, William Perschon served in the stake presidency, where he influenced a young bishop by the name of Thomas S. Monson. In the 1950s, Bishop Perschon was called to preside over the Swiss-Austrian Mission and played an instrumental role in building the first \u201coverseas\u201d temple, located in Bern, Switzerland.\nYou could scarcely think of Bishop Perschon without thinking of his concern and compassion for others and his untiring commitment to teach that same quality to others. Of the young men in the Aaronic Priesthood over whom he presided as bishop, 29 went on to become bishops themselves. Ten served in stake presidencies. Five became mission presidents, three accepted calls as temple presidents, and two served as General Authorities.2\nThat is the power of a great leader, brethren. That is the power of service.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t fully understand it at the time, it is clear to me now that these lessons\u2014and many others I learned as a youth\u2014served as the foundation upon which the rest of my life has been built.\nWe all possess spiritual gifts. Some are blessed with the gift of faith, others the gift of healing. In the body of the Church, all of the spiritual gifts are present. In my case, perhaps one of the spiritual gifts for which I am most grateful is that I have been blessed with an obedient spirit. When I heard wise counsel from my parents or Church leaders, I listened and tried to make it part of my thoughts and actions.\nBrethren of the priesthood, I urge you to cultivate the gift of an obedient spirit. The Savior taught that \u201cwhosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man. \u2026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man.\u201d3\nHow do we know if we are wise or foolish? When we hear inspired counsel, we obey. That is the test of wise or foolish.\nWhat does it profit us if we listen to wise counsel and do not heed the words? Of what use is experience if we do not learn from it? What good are the scriptures if we do not cherish the words and incorporate them into our lives?\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley has promised that \u201c[Heavenly Father] will shower down blessings upon those who walk in obedience to His commandments.\u201d4\nI add my voice to his.\nI testify that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of all mankind. I testify that God is close at hand. He cares about us and loves us, His children. Prophets, seers, and revelators guide the progress of the restored Church of Jesus Christ. President Gordon B. Hinckley stands as a latter-day prophet to the Church and to the world.\nI give thanks to my Creator for this wonderful life where each of us has the opportunity to learn lessons we could not fully comprehend by any other means.\nMy dear brethren, may we set righteous goals and work to achieve them, do what is right, and reach out in love to those around us. This is my prayer and testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJoseph B. Wirthlin\nLife\u2019s Lessons Learned\n2007\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "\nBarbara B. Smith\nA Season for Strength\n1983\nGeneral Women's Meeting\n"}, {"text": "Many of you suffer needlessly from carrying heavy burdens because you do not open your hearts to the healing power of the Lord. May this message encourage you to feel the prompting of the Holy Ghost to make those changes that will lead you to be free of oppressive burdens. The Savior has promised, \u201cI will \u2026 ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that \u2026 you cannot feel them \u2026 ; and this will I do \u2026 that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.\u201d1 I will first speak to you who suffer because of your own wrong choices, then I will give suggestions for you that anguish for what others have done to you.\nSeated across from me was a despondent man, head buried in hands, sobbing from the inevitable consequences of repeated violations of the commandments of God. He anguished: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. Everything is pressing in on me. I\u2019m tired of running. There is no peace, no happiness. When I pray, no one is listening. What\u2019s the use?\u201d\nI have known him for a long time. His parents and others have tried to give him guidance with little success. Because of his choices, he has become separated from the truths that would help him. He has not cultivated faith in the Master nor in the power of prayer. His decisions are centered on what could quickly satisfy his cravings. He either ignores problems or lies about them. He has manipulated the generosity of parents and friends to attempt a quick fix to challenges. He does not evaluate the consequences of today\u2019s decisions on tomorrow\u2019s life.\nAs my heart sorrowed for him, I realized he does not see the world as it really is\u2014a place of joy and happiness, of true friendships where faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His teachings invite the Holy Ghost to prompt correct decisions. He lives in an environment dominated by the influence of Satan. He has not followed sound counsel, because in his world he cannot see how it would possibly work for him. This distorted view of life is reality to him. It was forged as he succumbed to the subtle temptations of \u201cGo ahead. Try it. Nobody will ever know. It\u2019s your life. Live it the way you want to. They can\u2019t force you. You have your moral agency.\u201d\nThese promptings and the allure of the forbidden led him down a path that seemed fascinatingly attractive. He was carried on the crest of the wave of appetite and passion, oblivious to the consequences until the inevitable crushing encounter with the laws of God occurred. That produced pain, remorse, and regret. Then Satan provided other direction: \u201cThere is no way back. You might as well keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s hopeless to try to change.\u201d Because of his sins, he cannot see a way out of his failures. He will not see the tools needed for a new life in his current environment. His tragic, confining world has been created by the violation of eternal law, motivated by desire for a quick response.\nDo you find yourself in a similar circumstance? Have you done things that you wish you had not done? Is it difficult for you to see any way to solve your problems? Does there seem to be an oppressive, crushing weight that\u2019s always there no matter how you seek to shake it? Under the influence of powerful emotions or stimulants you may have periods where there seems to be relief. Yet in the quiet moments of reflection that inevitably come, you realize that your life is not what you want it to be. You may publicly complain that your friends and even the Lord have abandoned you, but in times of sober reflection you realize it is you that have abandoned them. Oh, please, decide now to find the way back to the refreshing peace and joy that can replace the fleeting pleasures of sin and the subsequent agony and emptiness. You have confirmed what the scriptures teach: \u201cwickedness never was happiness.\u201d2 Earn enduring joy now from a clean and purposeful life.3\nI know that you can escape the controlling influence of the evil one, and the repressive chains that bind your life. That relief will require you to accept a solution that is likely foreign to your current personal experience. It will require you to exercise faith in a Father in Heaven who loves you. While you may not understand why now, you must trust that the Savior has given His life so that you can make the required changes in your life, changes that will bring peace and the illusive success that always seem beyond your reach. Believe that you can overcome the depressing environment in which you live by trusting that there is a better way. You must seek the help of others who understand and live that better way, even though you cannot see it now. This will require you to learn and obey the teachings of the Lord. Once you have fully committed yourself to that change, you will find that it is not as difficult as it now may seem.\nThe painful consequences of sin were purposely put in His plan of happiness by a compassionate Father in Heaven so that you need not follow that tragic path in life. A sinner will not only suffer in this life, but sins that have not been forgiven through true repentance will cause anguish beyond the veil.4\nSatan strives to convince one that sins can be hidden from others, yet it is he that causes them to be revealed in the most compromising circumstances. His objective is the enslavement of God\u2019s children. All of his enticing, alluring temptations have as their root the destruction of the individual. In fact, each of us needs consistently to repent and obey so that the gift of the Savior will satisfy the demands of justice for even our small errors of commission or omission.\nThe Savior will take upon Himself the consequences of your sins as you repent now. If that is not done, in time you will have to suffer for them yourself.\nSeek out your bishop. He will show you how to repent and will help you do it. As you pray and act, you will be led to others who will support you.5 Repentance is a process of cleansing. It is difficult, but it has an end, a glorious end with peace and refreshing forgiveness and the miracle of a new beginning. Confession of improper acts is an important step but that is not full repentance. Your bishop will carefully explain what you must do. I will mention two aspects of repentance that bring great healing power. One is found in this declaration of the Master:\n\u201cFor I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;\n\u201cNevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven.\u201d6\nThat scripture emphasizes that the Lord cannot abide sin but He will forgive the repentant sinner because of His perfect love. It also teaches that not only is it important to keep a commandment you have broken, but by obeying all of the commandments you will obtain additional power and support in the process of repentance.\nAnother vital aspect of repentance is to recognize the role of the Savior through His Atonement. Indeed, it is that very Atonement that makes repentance even possible. As you pray and ponder the role of Jesus Christ as your Savior and Redeemer, you will acquire great motivation and encouragement to help you repent. Follow this example of Alma:\n\u201cI was \u2026 in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.\n\u201c\u2026 I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn \u2026 that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world.\u201d7\nYou will be helped by studying the magnificent explanation of the need for repentance and how it can be obtained, as Alma counseled his wayward son, Corianton, in the Book of Mormon.8 Through trust in the plan of happiness and the capacity of the Savior to realize His promises, the darkness of sin can be swept away and the joy of a worthy life returned with the trust of loved ones, when earned the Lord\u2019s way. Do not blame others for your mistakes. Humbly repent, for it is written, \u201cHe offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.\u201d9 Please, decide to repent, now.\nYou may be carrying a heavy burden of feeling injured by another who has seriously offended you. Your response to that offense may have distorted your understanding so that you feel justified in waiting for that individual to ask forgiveness so that the pain can leave. The Savior dispelled any such thought when He commanded:\n\u201cWherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.\n\u201cI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.\u201d10\nDon\u2019t carry the burden of offense any longer. Genuinely ask forgiveness of one that has offended you, even when you consider you have done no wrong. That effort will assuredly bring you peace and will likely begin the healing of serious misunderstandings.\nIf you are free of serious sin yourself, don\u2019t suffer needlessly the consequences of another\u2019s sins. As a wife, husband, parent, or loved one, you can feel compassion for one who is in the gall of bitterness from sin. Yet you should not take upon yourself a feeling of responsibility for those acts. When you have done what is reasonable to help one you love, lay the burden at the feet of the Savior. He has invited you to do that so that you can be free from pointless worry and depression.11 As you so act, not only will you find peace but will demonstrate your faith in the power of the Savior to lift the burden of sin from a loved one through his repentance and obedience.\nNow to you who have been scarred by the ugly sin of abuse. Mental, physical, or sexual abuse can cause serious, enduring consequences unless healed by the Lord. They may include fear, depression, guilt, self-hatred, and a deepening lack of trust in others that becomes a barrier to healing. Your abuse results from another\u2019s unrighteous attack on your moral agency against your will. In justice, the Lord has provided a way for you to overcome the destructive consequences of abuse. That relief can begin with the counsel of parents, priesthood leaders, and, when needed, the help of competent professionals. Yet you need not experience a lifetime of counseling. Complete healing will come through your faith in Jesus Christ and His power and capacity, through His Atonement, to heal the scars of that which is unjust and undeserved. You may find that hard to believe with your current feelings. I have witnessed how the Savior has healed aggravated cases of abuse in that way. Ponder the power of the Atonement.12 Pray to understand how it can heal you.13 Seek the aid of your bishop so that the Lord can free you of a burden you did not originate.\nIn closing, if you have felt impressions to be free of burdens caused by yourself or others, those promptings are an invitation from the Redeemer. Act upon them now. He loves you. He gave His life that you may be free of needless burdens. He will help you do it. I know that He has the power to heal you. Begin now. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard G. Scott\nTo Be Free of Heavy Burdens\n2002\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "It was in his final address to his people that King Benjamin gave them a formula for retaining a remission of their sins. He had seen their willingness to enter into a covenant with God to do His will and to be obedient to His commandments in all things. Would it not be beneficial for us to review that formula so that we, too, might enjoy this great blessing?\nAfter having received the great joy that comes from knowing the goodness of God and having tasted of His love, King Benjamin taught his people three basic principles that would help them retain a remission of their sins: first, to remain humble; second, to call upon the Lord daily; and third, to stand steadfast in the faith of that which was to come (see Mosiah 4:11).\nLet us review each of these so that we may also be strengthened in our resolves to retain a remission of our sins.\nRemain Humble\nElder Bruce R. McConkie taught us that \u201call progress in spiritual things is conditioned upon the prior attainment of humility.\u201d1 Humility has been described as having the \u201cdesire to submit to the Lord,\u201d the \u201cdesire to seek the Lord\u2019s will and glory,\u201d and the \u201cdesire to remove pride.\u201d2 King Benjamin told his people that they should \u201calways retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility\u201d (Mosiah 4:11). The Lord counseled in the Doctrine and Covenants that \u201cinasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time\u201d (D&C 1:28).\nMay we each develop our humility by submitting to the will of the Lord in all things so that we may retain a remission of our sins.\nCall upon the Lord Daily\nPrayer is one of the greatest blessings we have while here on earth. Through prayer we can communicate with our Heavenly Father and seek His guidance daily. Jesus taught, \u201cYe must always pray unto the Father in my name\u201d (3 Ne. 18:19). We should pray each day that we will have the power to resist temptation. Amulek teaches us that we should pray \u201cmorning, mid-day, and evening\u201d and that our hearts should \u201cbe full, drawn out in prayer unto [God] continually\u201d (Alma 34:21, 27). Our daily prayers influence our thoughts, our words, and our actions. In order to retain a remission of our sins, it is essential that we ask our Heavenly Father each day for strength to stay in the straight and narrow way.\nIn the general conference of last April, President James E. Faust taught that \u201cto sustain faith, each of us must be humble and compassionate, kind and generous to the poor and the needy. Faith is further sustained by daily doses of spirituality that come to us as we kneel in prayer.\u201d3\nA beautiful portrayal of prayer was given by President Gordon B. Hinckley in his opening remarks of the October 1996 general conference: \u201cYou have prayed that you might hear things that will help you with your problems and add strength to your faith. I assure you that we have prayed also. We have prayed for inspiration and direction. There is a constant prayer in our hearts that we will not fail in the great trust the Lord has placed in us and the trust you have placed in us. We have prayed that we might be prompted to say those words which will build faith and testimony and which will become answered prayers for those who will hear.\u201d4\nI testify that those who call upon the Lord daily will have greater power to retain a remission of their sins.\nStand Steadfast\nRecently I stood with the missionaries of the Montevideo Uruguay West Mission as they quoted aloud the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cO ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day\u201d (D&C 4:2). I felt the spirit of their callings as they stand steadfast in their stewardships of bringing souls to Christ. Latter-day Saints are commanded to \u201clift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand\u201d (D&C 27:15). King Benjamin taught that his people were to stand steadfast \u201cin the faith of that which [was] to come\u201d (Mosiah 4:11). They had \u201ccried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, \u2026 who shall come down among the children of men\u201d (Mosiah 4:2).\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of [their] exceeding faith \u2026 in Jesus Christ who should come\u201d (Mosiah 4:3).\nToday we can stand steadfast in the testimony of \u201cThe Living Christ,\u201d as given by living Apostles: \u201cWe testify that He will someday return to earth. \u2018And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together\u2019 (Isa. 40:5). He will rule as King of Kings and reign as Lord of Lords, and every knee shall bend and every tongue shall speak in worship before Him. Each of us will stand to be judged of Him according to our works and the desires of our hearts.\u201d5\nBrothers and sisters, these blessings can be ours if we will apply these same three principles in our lives. Those Saints in King Benjamin\u2019s day were promised that if they would do this, they would always rejoice and be filled with the love of God. This gave them power in retaining a remission of their sins. They were promised that they would grow in the knowledge of the Lord and in the knowledge of that which was just and true. They would have no mind to injure one another but would live at peace with one another. They would discipline their children with love and teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness. They would love one another and serve one another. They would impart of their substance to care for the poor, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and to take care of the sick. They would administer relief to their fellowmen both spiritually and temporally. What greater blessing could we ask for?\nMay God grant that we, too, may retain a remission of our sins. I testify that God lives and that His Only Begotten Son is indeed our Savior and our Redeemer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElder Keith Crockett\nRetaining a Remission of Sin\n2000\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "As a young returned missionary, I and my returned missionary friends routinely bade our farewells with the words, \u201cKeep the faith.\u201d While this was a clich\u00e9 given casually with very little thought, the admonition is serious, and it is the Lord\u2019s.\nThe Apostle Paul, in his second epistle to Timothy, declared, \u201cI have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\u201d (2 Tim. 4:7.) Keeping the faith to the end has always been our charge. In the eighteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord admonishes, \u201cAnd as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.\u201d (D&C 18:22.)\nI shall never forget the impression left upon me when President Joseph Fielding Smith, in his ninety-fifth year, exclaimed, \u201cI hope to endure to the end in this life.\u201d Today, perhaps more than ever before, our faith is challenged on all fronts. This should not surprise us as it is part of God\u2019s plan. As Abraham proved himself to the Lord with unwavering faith when he took his son Isaac to the mountain to be sacrificed, we also must prove our devotion, our endurance, and our faith to our Heavenly Father.\nWe all face the normal and the expected challenges of mortality. We experience illness, we encounter transgression, we work through the difficulties of repentance, we sometimes wrestle with rebellion, and we deal with the stresses of providing for our families. These are expected. These we prepare for, and these we cope with.\nFor the faithful, the normal tests and trials of life need not be the enemy of faith. While we don\u2019t necessarily look forward to these obstacles and challenges, we accept them, and we build our lives and faith from them. To the faithful, the very obstacles that we overcome draw us closer to our Heavenly Father by helping us develop a humble, submissive spirit and causing us to be grateful and appreciative of those blessings that flow from a loving Father. In short, these experiences can and often do increase our faith. The faithful do not pray to be spared the trials of life but pray that they may have the strength to rise above them. In so doing they come closer to Heavenly Father and to that state of perfection they are seeking.\nFor Latter-day Saints, often the greater testing of faith\u2014the subtle but more serious testing\u2014comes not from the normal obstacles of mortality but from the successes of mortality. There is a strong relationship, even a cause-effect relationship, between faith and the required virtues of humility and a submissive heart, which have always been key ingredients of faith. So-called temporal achievements, whether materialistic or intellectual, when untempered with the principles of the gospel and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, often move a person away from the fundamental principles that foster faith. When our successes are received without proper acknowledgment to Him who is the grantor of all blessings, these same successes often lead to false pride and a deterioration of the virtues that bring us to faith. When our successes lead to self-aggrandizement or the substitution of our earthly learning for Heavenly Father\u2019s will, we jeopardize the principles upon which our faith is founded. Anything that erodes humility and submissiveness is indeed a threat to faith.\nWhatever our station in life, whatever our achievements, no matter how great, a submissive heart and a humble spirit are still fundamental to our faith. We must guard against letting our worldly successes or earthly learning become a substitution for spiritual wisdom and divine direction given through the prophets.\nIn the Book of Mormon, Mormon explains the deteriorating condition of the Nephites resulting from their misplaced sense of achievement in earthly matters: \u201cFor they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.\u201d (Alma 4:8.)\nThe Lord further warns us against relying solely upon man\u2019s strength and wisdom. He said, \u201cCursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.\u201d (2 Ne. 28:31.)\nJacob further enlightens us with the following: \u201cO that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.\u201d (2 Ne. 9:28.) Jacob then clarifies so we may all understand that learning under the proper circumstances has an important place in our lives. He explains, \u201cBut to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.\u201d (2 Ne. 9:29.)\nThere are the so-called learned people who have let their intellect undermine their spiritual moorings and who would also attempt to lead the faithful away from those who are appointed by the Lord to lead. There are those who feel that our leaders are out of touch with the realities of the day. They would attempt to lead members by substituting their own knowledge for the revelations from God to His prophets. And unfortunately there are those who would so follow. Christ warned, \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\u201d (Matt. 7:15.)\nIn an attempt to further prepare the Saints against the inevitable threatening wolves, Paul the Apostle gave his warning: \u201cFor I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\u201d (Acts 20:29.) Where might these wolves get sheep\u2019s clothing that is so authentic as to deceive the Lord\u2019s flock? Could it be they are clothed with exceeding riches and fine clothing as Mormon warned? (See Alma 4:8.) The vainness and frailties and foolishness of men, the learned that hearken not unto the commandments of God, as Jacob warned? (See 2 Ne. 9:28.) Could it be that sometimes they may clothe themselves to appear as righteous shepherds, that even the very elect might be deceived?\nYes, like Abraham of old, our faith is going to be tested. We will suffer sickness, pain, death, and tragedy. This is inevitable. This is a major reason why we opted to participate in mortality. We can endure these trials and tribulations because we can draw upon the gifts of heaven, which will help us see them for what they are. As we conquer them, we are drawn closer to our Heavenly Father. We feel His love, gain His knowledge and truth. We are able to meet the test and endure these to the end.\nBut it is that which we may not recognize for what it is that we must be concerned about\u2014the substitution of man\u2019s will for God\u2019s inspired direction. Let us not be led astray by the sophistry of man, untempered by the principles of the gospel and the Spirit of the Lord. Let us not lose sight of those enduring God-given principles of humility and the submissive heart that have sustained us since the restoration of the gospel. Let us seek truth and guidance from a loving Father. Let us look to our Father in Heaven and His living prophets and personal revelation for guidance. When the prophets speak, let us listen and obey.\nI bear solemn witness that God lives, that He cares enough to direct His prophets for our blessing and edification. I bear witness that as we seek direction from our Father, as we follow the prophets, our faith will be sustained and enlarged. And so, my brothers and sisters, my farewell words to you today, not given casually and not given without meaning and contemplation, but given with the soberness and the sincerity of my heart, are simply, \u201cKeep the faith.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard C. Edgley\nKeep the Faith\n1993\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I feel blessed to be in this meeting with those who hold the priesthood of God. The devotion, the faith, and the selfless service of this body of men and boys are a modern miracle. I speak tonight to priesthood holders, older and younger, united in wholehearted service to the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe Lord grants His power to those in all priesthood offices who worthily serve in their priesthood duties.\nWilford Woodruff, as President of the Church, described his experience in the offices of the priesthood:\n\u201cI heard the first sermon I ever heard in this Church. The next day I was baptized. \u2026 I was ordained a Teacher. My mission immediately commenced. \u2026 I went through that whole mission as a Teacher. \u2026 At the conference I was ordained a Priest. \u2026 After I was ordained a Priest I was sent \u2026 on a mission to the southern country. That was in the fall of 1834. I had a companion with me, and we started out without purse and scrip. I traveled alone a good many miles and preached the Gospel, and I baptized a number that I could not confirm in the Church, because I was only a Priest. \u2026 I traveled some time preaching the Gospel before I was ordained an Elder.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201c[Now] I have been some fifty-four years a member of the Twelve Apostles. I have traveled with that and other quorums now for sixty years; and I want to say to this assembly that I was just as much sustained by the power of God while holding the office of a Teacher, and especially while officiating in the vineyard as a Priest, as I ever was as an Apostle. There is no difference in this so long as we do our duty.\u201d1\nThat wonderful spiritual possibility of no difference is suggested in the Lord\u2019s description of the Aaronic Priesthood as an \u201cappendage\u201d of the Melchizedek Priesthood.2 The word appendage means the two are connected. This connection is important to the priesthood becoming the force and the blessing it can be, in this world and forever, for it \u201cis without beginning of days or end of years.\u201d3\nThe connection is a simple one. The Aaronic Priesthood prepares young men for an even more sacred trust.\n\u201cThe power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church\u2014\n\u201cTo have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.\u201d4\nThose priesthood keys are fully exercised by only one man at a time, the President and presiding high priest of the Lord\u2019s Church. Then, by the President\u2019s delegation, every man who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood can be endowed with authority and the privilege of speaking and acting in the name of the Almighty. There is infinity to that power. It is concerned with life and death, with family and the Church, with the great nature of God Himself and His eternal work.\nThe Lord is preparing the Aaronic Priesthood holder to become an elder serving with faith, power, and gratitude in that glorious Melchizedek Priesthood.\nFor elders, deep gratitude will be essential to playing your part in full priesthood service. You will remember your days as a deacon, teacher, or priest when those who held the higher priesthood reached back to lift and encourage you in your priesthood journey.\nEvery holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood has such memories, but the sense of gratitude may have diminished with the years. My hope is to rekindle that feeling and with it a determination to give to all you can the same kind of help you once received.\nI remember a bishop who treated me as if I were already what I had the potential to become in priesthood power. He called me one Sunday when I was a priest. He said he needed me to be his companion to visit some members of our ward. He made it sound as if I were his only hope for success. He didn\u2019t need me. He had excellent counselors in his bishopric.\nWe visited a penniless and hungry widow. He wanted me to help him reach her heart, challenge her to make and use a budget, and promise her that she could rise to be in a position not only to take care of herself but also to help others.\nWe went next to comfort two little girls living in a difficult situation. As we walked away, the bishop said quietly to me, \u201cThose children will never forget that we came to them.\u201d\nAt the next house, I saw how to invite a less-active man to come back to the Lord by convincing him the ward members needed him.\nThat bishop was a Melchizedek Priesthood holder who was raising my sights and giving me a boost by example. He taught me to have the power and the courage to go anywhere in service for the Lord. He is long gone to his reward, but I still remember him because he reached down to lift me up when I was an inexperienced Aaronic Priesthood holder. I learned later that he saw me on a future priesthood path of greater responsibilities, then beyond my own vision.\nMy father did the same thing for me. He was a seasoned and wise holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Once he was asked by an Apostle to write a short note about the scientific evidence for the age of the earth. He wrote it carefully, knowing that some who might read it had strong feelings that the earth was much younger than the scientific evidence suggested.\nI still remember my father handing me what he had written and saying to me, \u201cHal, you have the spiritual wisdom to know if I should send this to the apostles and prophets.\u201d I can\u2019t remember much of what the paper said, but I will carry with me forever the gratitude I felt for a great Melchizedek Priesthood holder who saw in me spiritual wisdom that I could not see.\nOne night, some years later, after I had been ordained an Apostle, the prophet of God called me and asked me to read something that had been written about Church doctrine. He had spent the night reading the chapters of a book. He said with a chuckle, \u201cI can\u2019t get through all of this. You shouldn\u2019t be resting while I\u2019m working.\u201d And then he used almost the same words my father had years before: \u201cHal, you are the one who should read this. You will know if it is right to publish it.\u201d\nThat same pattern of a Melchizedek Priesthood holder raising sights and giving confidence came one night at a speech festival sponsored by the Church. At 17 years of age, I was asked to speak to a large audience. I had no idea what was expected of me. I wasn\u2019t given a subject, and so I prepared a talk that was way beyond what I knew about the gospel. As I spoke, I realized I had made a mistake. I can still remember that after I spoke, I had a sinking feeling of having failed.\nThe next and final speaker was Elder Matthew Cowley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He was a great orator\u2014beloved across the Church. I still remember looking up at him from my seat next to the rostrum.\nHe began in a powerful voice. He said that my speech had made him feel that he was at a great conference. He smiled as he said it. My feelings of failure left and were followed by confidence that I might someday become what he seemed to think I already was.\nThe memory of that night still leads me to listen carefully when an Aaronic Priesthood holder speaks. Because of what Elder Cowley did for me, I always expect that I will hear the word of God. I am seldom disappointed and often amazed, and I can\u2019t help but smile as Elder Cowley did.\nMany things may help strengthen our younger brothers to rise up in the priesthood, but nothing will be more powerful than our helping them develop the faith and confidence that they can draw on the power of God in their priesthood service.\nThat faith and confidence won\u2019t stay with them from a single experience of being lifted by even the most gifted Melchizedek Priesthood holder. The ability to draw on those powers must be cultivated by many expressions of confidence from those who are more experienced in the priesthood.\nThe Aaronic Priesthood holders will also need daily and even hourly encouragement and correction from the Lord Himself through the Holy Ghost. That will be available to them as they choose to remain worthy of it. It will depend upon the choices they will make.\nThat is why we must teach by example and by testimony that the words of the great Melchizedek Priesthood leader King Benjamin are true.5 They are words of love spoken in the name of the Lord, whose priesthood this is. King Benjamin teaches what is required of us to remain pure enough to receive the encouragement and the correction of the Lord:\n\u201cAnd finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.\n\u201cBut this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.\u201d6\nWe all are aware of the fiery darts of the enemy of righteousness being sent like a terrible wind against the young priesthood holders we love so much. To us, they seem like the stripling warriors, who called themselves the sons of Helaman. They can survive, as\u00a0those young warriors did, if they keep themselves safe, as King Benjamin urged them to do.\nThe sons of Helaman did not doubt. They fought bravely and came off conquerors because they believed the words of their mothers.7 We understand the power of the faith of a loving mother. Mothers provide that great support to their sons today. We holders of the priesthood can and must add to that support with our determination to answer the charge that as we are converted, we are to reach down to strengthen our brethren.8\nMy prayer is that every Melchizedek Priesthood holder will accept the opportunity offered by the Lord:\n\u201cAnd if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.\n\u201cTherefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser priesthood, and send them before you to make appointments, and to prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill.\n\u201cBehold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me.\u201d9\nYou priesthood leaders and fathers of Aaronic Priesthood holders can work miracles. You can help the Lord fill the ranks of faithful elders with young men who accept the call to preach the gospel and do it with confidence. You will see many you have lifted and encouraged stay faithful, marry worthily in the temple, and in turn, lift and prepare others.\nIt will not take new activity programs, improved teaching materials, or better social media. It will not require any call beyond what you have now. The oath and the covenant of the priesthood gives you power, authority, and direction. I pray you will go home and study carefully the oath and covenant of the priesthood, found in Doctrine and Covenants section 84.\nAll of us hope that more young men will have experiences like Wilford Woodruff, who as an Aaronic Priesthood holder taught the gospel of Jesus Christ with converting power.\nI pray that we will rise to our call to lift others to prepare them for their glorious service. I thank with all my heart the wonderful people who have lifted me and shown me how to love and lift others.\nI testify that President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson holds all the keys of the priesthood on earth at this time. I bear witness that he, over a lifetime of service, has been an example for us all of reaching to lift others as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood. I am personally grateful for the way he has lifted me and shown me how to lift others.\nGod the Father lives. Jesus is the Christ. This is His Church and kingdom. This is His priesthood. I know this for myself by the power of the Holy Ghost. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring\nThat He May Become Strong Also\n2016\nGeneral Priesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "In the past year I have met thousands of Latter-day Saint women in many countries. The list of challenges these sisters face is lengthy and sobering. There are family troubles, economic tests, calamities, accidents, and illnesses. There is much distraction and not enough peace and joy. Despite popular media messages to the contrary, no one is rich enough, beautiful enough, or clever enough to avoid a mortal experience.\nThe questions sisters ask are serious and insightful. They articulate uneasiness about the future, sorrow for unrealized expectations, some indecision, and diminished feelings of self-worth. They also reflect a deep desire to do what is right.\nThere has grown in me an overwhelming testimony of the value of daughters of God. So much depends on them. In my visits with the sisters, I have felt that there has never been a greater need for increased faith and personal righteousness. There has never been a greater need for strong families and homes. There has never been more that could be done to help others who are in need. How does one increase faith, strengthen families, and provide relief?1 How does a woman in our day find answers to her own questions and stand strong and immovable against incredible opposition and difficulty?\nPersonal Revelation\nA good woman knows that she does not have enough time, energy, or opportunity to take care of all of the people or do all of the worthy things her heart yearns to do. Life is not calm for most women, and each day seems to require the accomplishment of a million things, most of which are important. A good woman must constantly resist alluring and deceptive messages from many sources telling her that she is entitled to more time away from her responsibilities and that she deserves a life of greater ease and independence. But with personal revelation, she can prioritize correctly and navigate this life confidently.\nThe ability to qualify for, receive, and act on personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be acquired in this life. Qualifying for the Lord\u2019s Spirit begins with a desire for that Spirit and implies a certain degree of worthiness. Keeping the commandments, repenting, and renewing covenants made at baptism lead to the blessing of always having the Lord\u2019s Spirit with us.2 Making and keeping temple covenants also adds spiritual strength and power to a woman\u2019s life. Many answers to difficult questions are found by reading the scriptures because the scriptures are an aid to revelation.3 Insight found in scripture accumulates over time, so it is important to spend some time in the scriptures every day. Daily prayer is also essential to having the Lord\u2019s Spirit with us.4 Those who earnestly seek help through prayer and scripture study often have a paper and pencil nearby to write questions and record impressions and ideas.\nRevelation can come hour by hour and moment by moment as we do the right things. When women nurture as Christ nurtured, a power and peace can descend to guide when help is needed. For instance, mothers can feel help from the Spirit even when tired, noisy children are clamoring for attention, but they can be distanced from the Spirit if they lose their temper with children. Being in the right places allows us to receive guidance. It requires a conscious effort to diminish distractions, but having the Spirit of revelation makes it possible to prevail over opposition and persist in faith through difficult days and essential routine tasks. Personal revelation gives us the understanding of what to do every day to increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek those who need our help. Because personal revelation is a constantly renewable source of strength, it is possible to feel bathed in help even during turbulent times.\nWe are told to put our trust in that Spirit which leads us \u201cto do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously.\u201d5 We are also told that this Spirit will enlighten our minds, fill our souls with joy, and help us know all things we should do.6 Promised personal revelation comes when we ask for it, prepare for it, and go forward in faith, trusting that it will be poured out upon us.\nRelief Society\u2014Teaching, Inspiring, and Strengthening\nAdditionally, the Lord in His wisdom has provided a Relief Society to help His daughters in these latter days. When Relief Society functions in an inspired way, it lifts women up and out of a troubled world and into a way of living that prepares them for the blessings of eternal life. This society has at its very core the responsibility to help sisters increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek out and help others who are in need. Through Relief Society, sisters can receive answers to their questions and be blessed by the combined spiritual power of all the sisters. Relief Society validates the true and eternal nature of daughters of God. It is a sacred trust, a guiding light, and a system of watchcare that teaches and inspires women to be strong and immovable. Its motto, \u201cCharity never faileth,\u201d7 is embodied in all good women.\nWhen a girl advances into Relief Society or when a woman is baptized into the Church, she becomes part of a sisterhood that strengthens her in her preparation for eternal life. Entrance into Relief Society signifies that a woman can be trusted and relied upon to make a significant contribution in the Church. She continues to progress as an individual without receiving much outward credit or praise.\nThe second general Relief Society president, Eliza R. Snow, said this to the sisters: \u201cWe want to be ladies in very deed, not according to the term of the word as the world judges, but fit companions of the Gods and Holy Ones. In an organized capacity we can assist each other in not only doing good but in refining ourselves, and whether few or many come forward and help to prosecute this great work, they will be those that will fill honorable positions in the Kingdom of God. \u2026 Women should be women and not babies that need petting and correction all the time. I know we like to be appreciated but if we do not get all the appreciation which we think is our due, what matters? We know the Lord has laid high responsibility upon us, and there is not a wish or desire that the Lord has implanted in our hearts in righteousness but will be realized, and the greatest good we can do to ourselves and each other is to refine and cultivate ourselves in everything that is good and ennobling to qualify us for those responsibilities.\u201d8\nMeasuring Success\nGood women always have a desire to know if they are succeeding. In a world where the measures of success are often distorted, it is important to seek appreciation and affirmation from proper sources. To paraphrase a list found in Preach My Gospel, we are doing well when we develop attributes of Christ and strive to obey His gospel with exactness. We are doing well when we seek to improve ourselves and do our best. We are doing well when we increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek out and help others who are in need. We know we are successful if we live so that we qualify for, receive, and know how to follow the Spirit. When we have done our very best, we may still experience disappointments, but we will not be disappointed in ourselves. We can feel certain that the Lord is pleased when we feel the Spirit working through us.9 Peace, joy, and hope are available to those who measure success properly.\nA revelation in the book of Joel states that in the last days, sons and daughters of God will prophesy and the Lord will pour out His Spirit upon His servants and His handmaids.10 President Spencer W. Kimball echoed this prophecy when he said:\n\u201cMuch of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality) will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the Church are seen as distinct and different\u2014in happy ways\u2014from the women of the world. \u2026\n\u201cThus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and spiritual growth of the Church in the last days.\u201d11\nI bear my witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. The Lord depends on His daughters to do their part to strengthen the homes of Zion and build His kingdom on the earth. As they seek and qualify for personal revelation, the Lord will pour out His Spirit upon His handmaids in these latter days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJulie B. Beck\n\u201cAnd upon the Handmaids in Those Days Will I Pour Out My Spirit\u201d\n2010\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "How I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to continue to be with all of us, as it has been thus far.\nThe injunction from God to \u201cRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\u201d (Ex. 20:8) has been in force throughout human history. There is power in keeping the Sabbath day holy. I testify that God lives, that we are his children, that he loves us, and that he gives us commandments so he can bless us as we keep them and thereby have joy. As we keep the Sabbath day holy he will bless us, and we will achieve a quiet power for good as individuals, as families, and as nations, that we cannot obtain in any other way.\nLet me give two examples:\nThe small island kingdom of Tonga lies immediately next to the international dateline, so it is the first country in the world to greet the Sabbath day. It is a small country and, in the counting of the world, a poor country. But years ago a wise Tongan king decreed that the Sabbath would be kept holy in Tonga forever.\nModern civilization has come in many ways to Tonga. If one goes to the capital of Nuku\u2019alofa on a weekday, he finds the usual heavy traffic of trucks and cars and the bustle of thousands of shoppers making their regular purchases from well-stocked stores and markets. One sees people line up to view the latest movies and to rent videos. One can watch modern buses whisk tourists off to catch their jet planes, or observe the speed and clarity of a satellite call to the United States. The streets are crowded and business is good. You might wonder, \u201cWhat is so different about this town from hundreds of others like it throughout the world?\u201d\nBut when Sunday dawns on the kingdom of Tonga, a transformation takes place. If one goes downtown, he sees deserted streets\u2014no taxis or buses or crowds of people. All the stores, all the markets, all the movie theaters, all the offices are closed. No planes fly, no ships come in or out, no commerce takes place. No games are played. The people go to church. Tonga is remembering to keep the Sabbath day holy.\nIt is significant that the first country in the world to greet the holy Sabbath keeps the Sabbath holy.\nHas the Lord blessed them? Maybe the world cannot see his blessings, but in the ways that really count, he has blessed them abundantly. He has blessed them with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and a larger percentage of the population there belongs to the Church than in any other country.\nSimple, well-kept chapels dot the land. Clean, smiling local missionaries are found everywhere. A beautiful, exceptionally well-attended temple stands in Tonga in fulfillment of promises made years and ages ago. And, as would be expected, their attendance at meetings and faithfulness in tithing are very near the top. Recently the Saints have been blessed with some fairly intense opposition that is having the effect of further sanctifying the true seekers of eternal life.\nDoes the Lord love and bless those who keep the Sabbath day holy? I testify that he does in eternally meaningful ways. I further testify that when we eventually see things through the proper perspective of eternal truth, we will be amazed at how much we were blessed in important\u2014though often unperceived\u2014ways through keeping the Sabbath holy; and to our sorrow we may sense how many blessings we kept from ourselves by not consistently keeping the Sabbath day holy.\nThere is a direct correlation between the proper observance of the Sabbath and true reverence for God, which includes obedience to his other commandments.\nWe can\u2019t all live in Tonga, but we can all keep the Sabbath day holy and receive the blessings that come therefrom\u2014and they come to us wherever we live, personally as well as collectively.\nLet me give another example from these very valleys:\nSome time ago I was assigned to a conference in northern Utah in June. As I drove through Cache Valley on Saturday, I was struck by the beauty of that peaceful green valley. I marveled at the temple in Logan\u2014such a serene, peaceful beacon in so many ways. As I continued north on that clear summer day, I was impressed with the green fields so rich with a variety of crops. I particularly noticed the great number of alfalfa fields and the constant activity in nearly all of them. What a pleasing sensation it was to smell that freshly mown hay and to see the straight rows and the orderly cutting of those meticulously groomed fields.\nI pulled the car over to the side of the road at the top of one of the hills and got out. I found myself absorbed right into that beautiful valley. As far as I could see was a whole panorama of the same activity in every direction\u2014hay being mowed and stacked and hauled.\nI finally drove on to the stake where we had a wonderful conference.\nMy parents live in southeast Idaho, and since I was already more than halfway there, I decided to drive up Sunday afternoon to visit them before returning home.\nSo, after conference I started north through the rest of Cache Valley. Within a few miles I was in Idaho, but the scenery and feeling were just the same. I again became absorbed in the beauty of the green fields and the smell of fresh hay all around. Again, I stopped at the top of one of the hills and got out and looked as far as I could in all directions. It was just as beautiful\u2014if not more so\u2014than the day before. \u201cYes, even more beautiful,\u201d I thought, \u201cbut why?\u201d The sun and sky and the clouds and the fields were all the same. Why this deep feeling that this sight this Sunday afternoon was even more beautiful than the day before?\nWhat was the difference? I noticed in the distance a small LDS chapel and a few cars starting to pull up to it. Then it struck me, rather peacefully but very effectively: \u201cThere is the difference. No one is mowing or hauling hay today.\u201d I looked as far as I could and saw hay fields everywhere, tractors stopped, mowing machines idle, and trucks resting in the fields, but no one working\u2014for it was the Sabbath and this was Cache Valley and these were largely good Latter- day Saint people.\nAs I continued north, I saw everywhere hay to be cut and stacked and hauled and equipment and weather to do it, but no man or woman in the fields. The people of this valley were observing a higher law, and the Sabbath was being kept holy in Cache Valley.\nI went by dozens, even hundreds, of farms with machines waiting in the fields\u2014left Saturday evening by God-fearing men waiting for Monday to come and the whine of activity to resume. I wondered to myself, \u201cWill someone break this spell, will someone be out in his fields working?\u201d\nEach time I rounded a corner or came to the top of a hill, I would look and look and then breathe a sigh of relief\u2014no one working.\nI went farther and farther north, realizing I was near the end of this beautiful valley. \u201cWould anyone break the spell? Could it be a whole valley so dedicated to God that no one would work on the Sabbath?\u201d The suspense became almost unbearable. Each curve I rounded or each hill I came over found me looking in almost fearful anticipation, then smiling as the same peaceful scene continued.\nFinally I came to the last curve and the confluence with the main road that marked the end of Cache Valley. I looked and looked, but all was peaceful and quiet. I was so excited, I pulled the car over, got out, and in almost a Toyota-like jump I raised my hands and shouted, \u201cYou did it, Cache Valley. You did it! I have traversed your length. You didn\u2019t know I was looking, but you did it\u2014not one field being mowed, not one tractor at work, not one truck hauling. You did it!\u201d (I recognize that I had been through only the northern end of the valley that Sunday, but it was still Cache Valley.)\nI instinctively looked heavenward and said, \u201cDid you see that? Did you see Cache Valley this Sunday afternoon?\u201d\nEven though I didn\u2019t hear anything, it was as though I sensed a response saying, \u201cYes, we know. We see everything.\u201d\nI had such a joyful feeling\u2014almost ecstasy\u2014as I drove north to a wonderful meeting with my parents before returning home.\nFor some time after that, I couldn\u2019t get that Sunday afternoon off my mind. I kept feeling, \u201cYou have observed and witnessed something very special, something truly significant: an entire valley keeping His Sabbath holy.\u201d\nIt caused me deep reflection then and many times since, but like so many things it was moved further and further to the back of my mind with the press of many current problems. Winter came, and for all intents and purposes it slipped from my conscious memory.\nI continued to travel each weekend to various parts of the world. Many months later, I was assigned to a conference in a city noted for its particularly flagrant violations of God\u2019s laws. The Saints there were wonderful, but oh, the decadence and debauchery that seemed to be all around them.\nAs I returned from the especially hectic weekend, I began reading in the scriptures. I thought about Sodom and Gomorrah. Could they have been much more wicked than this? And yet the Lord promised to spare them for fifty righteous souls\u2014or even down to ten\u2014but they were not found.\nI let my imagination go and seemed to see a band of destroying angels loosed from heaven\u2014thundering across the land. And even before I had time to think about the situation, I seemed to see myself standing in front of these determined destroyers, declaring, \u201cHold, hold, hold\u201d; and they held. \u201cGo back,\u201d I said: and their horses reared, their eyes flashing in impatience. The destroyers\u2019 anxiousness showed, but they held.\nThe leader looked me squarely in the eye and challenged, \u201cBy what right do you ask us to hold? Have you not seen the evil of the land?\u201d\nI replied, \u201cYes, I know of the sordidness of the world. I see the constant mocking of God\u2019s laws, the merchandising on his holy day, the constant breaking of his commandments. I see the evil that exists almost universally. Yes, yes, all these things are true, still \u2026\u201d Then I became concerned. What right had I to ask them to hold?\nMy eyes began to fall from his penetrating gaze, but something inside kept searching, searching, until finally a laserlike beam locked on to a misty memory made many months ago and faithfully filed away for such a time as this. A vista of a beautiful green valley passed before me and moved to the front of my consciousness.\nI raised my eyes and met his as he again said, \u201cWhat right do you have to ask us to hold?\u201d\nThen with the confidence of sure knowledge and spiritual direction, I replied, \u201cYou must hold, for you see, I have been through Cache Valley on a Sunday afternoon.\u201d\nThere was no hesitation, no anger, no look of surprise, no disappointment, only obedience; and he turned and rejoined his group, and they left.\nOh, my dear brothers and sisters, there is power in keeping the Sabbath day holy\u2014power to help others as well as ourselves. If we would have God\u2019s blessings and protection as individuals, as families, as communities, and as nations, we must keep His Sabbath day holy.\nMay we all live that someday, someway, somewhere, somehow, as we face that which is very serious, we may be able to say, \u201cHold, hold, hold\u201d; and, when challenged as to why (even by ourselves), be able\u2014through obedience and the confidence of the Spirit\u2014to say in our own way, \u201cFor I have been through Cache Valley on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d I do humbly pray in the name of our Savior, who lives. I know he lives, even Jesus Christ, amen.\nJohn\u00a0H.

A native\nof Connecticut, he was baptized in 1833. He participated in the Camp\nof Israel expedition and served numerous missions. 1 After being\nordained an Apostle in 1839, he served as a member of the Quorum of\nthe Twelve for more than 50 years. His regular, detailed diaries remain\none of the key sources on the early history of the Church.\nWoodruff married Phebe Whittemore Carter in 1837. In the 1840s he\naccepted the practice of plural marriage taught by Joseph Smith, and\nbetween 1846 and 1877, he married at least seven other women. He was\nthe father of 34 children. 2\nIn 1877 Woodruff became the first person to serve as a temple president\nwhen the St. George Utah Temple was completed. He served as the\npresident of that temple until 1884. After John Taylor\u2019s death in 1887,\nWoodruff led the Church as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve\nApostles, and about two years later he reorganized the First Presidency\nand was sustained as the President of the Church. 3\nAfter seeking revelation on the future of the Church in 1890, Woodruff\nreceived inspired direction to issue a document called the Manifesto,\nwhich initiated a transition away from the practice of plural marriage. 4\nFollowing a revelation in 1894, he introduced changes in the Church\u2019s\nsealing practices, teaching the Saints to seal themselves to their\nancestors even when their ancestors had not joined the Church. This\nreplaced the tradition of sealing oneself or one\u2019s ancestors to\nmissionaries or to Church leaders through adoption sealings. To\nsupport this work, Woodruff launched efforts to advance genealogical\nresearch, including the founding of the Genealogical Society of Utah.\nPresident Woodruff also directed the first mission calls to single women,\nopening a new era of sister missionary service.\nFor more information about the life of Wilford Woodruff, see the\nProphets of the Restoration videos on history.ChurchofJesusChrist.org and\nin the Gospel Library app.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/wilford-woodruff?lang=eng\n1/24/8/23, 5:13 PM\nWilford Woodruff\nChurch Resources\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff (2004).\nWilford Woodruff, Journals and papers, 1828\u20131898, Church History Library, Salt Lake\nCity.\n\u201cWilford Woodruff,\u201d Joseph Smith Papers, josephsmithpapers.org.\nBibliography\nThe following publication provides further information about this topic.

Three months after the Church was\norganized, in July 1830, Joseph Smith received a revelation for his wife\nEmma, instructing her to make a selection of sacred hymns for the\nChurch of Christ. \u201cFor my soul delighteth in the song of the heart,\u201d the\nLord declared. \u201cYea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me\u201d\n(D&C 25:12). This revelation affirmed the value of music as a part of the\nChurch\u2019s worship, and its appointment of Emma Smith was unusual as\nhymnals were rarely compiled by women. 1\nThe earliest Mormon hymns appeared in 1832 in The Evening and the\nMorning Star newspaper published by William W. Phelps and in 1834 in\nThe Messenger and Advocate. Some of these hymns were included in\nEmma\u2019s hymnal, A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter\nDay Saints. The hymnal, officially published in 1835, was prepared for\npublication by Phelps, and printing was completed in early 1836 in\nKirtland. The book was small enough to fit in a pocket and contained\n90 hymns. Between 30 and 40 of them were written by Latter-day Saints;\nthe remainder were popular Protestant hymns. Emma\u2019s second hymnal,\nprinted in Nauvoo in 1841, contained 304 hymns. 2 These and other early\nhymnbooks included only the words of the hymns and had no musical\nnotation. Saints selected familiar tunes to which the hymns were sung.\nHymns were an important vehicle for teaching and reinforcing the\ndoctrines of the Church. The preface to the 1835 hymnal noted that the\ncollection contained \u201c\u2018Sacred Hymns\u2019 adapted to their faith and belief\nin the gospel.\u201d Many early Mormon hymns were written by Latter-day\nSaints, such as Eliza R. Snow, Parley P. Pratt, and William W. Phelps.\nOther hymns written and sung by people in other faith traditions were\nincluded, and some of them were modified by Phelps to fit specific\nLatter-day Saint teachings. Since that first 1835 hymnal, topics such as\nZion, the Second Coming of the Savior, the Restoration of the gospel,\nthe Book of Mormon, and later the premortal existence, latter-day\nprophets, and the pioneer experience have filled the pages of hymnals\nand allowed Latter-day Saints to give voice to cherished beliefs.\nBesides the hymnals compiled by Emma Smith, other hymnals were\ncompiled in different places and for specific uses. One early hymnal was\nprinted in Manchester, England, in 1840 under the direction of Brigham\nYoung, Parley P. Pratt, and John Taylor. 3 Saints immigrating to Utah\nfrom England brought their hymnals and treasured hymns with them to\nthe Salt Lake Valley. The Manchester hymnal continued to be published\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/hymns?lang=eng\n1/34/8/23, 5:05 PM\nHymns\nin England until 1890. The first large collection of hymns to include\nmusical notation was the 1889 Latter-Day Saints\u2019 Psalmody, published\nunder the direction of President John Taylor. Auxiliary organizations\nsuch as the Sunday School, Relief Society, and Primary published their\nown hymnbooks beginning in 1880. 4 The Northern States Mission,\nbased in Chicago, printed 11 editions of Songs of Zion from 1908 to 1925.\nThis book became a \u201cmission field\u201d hymnal.\nChurch leaders formed a Church Music Committee in 1920 to better\ncoordinate music and the production of hymnals. In 1927, the\ncommittee combined hymns from different publications into one\nvolume, Latter-Day Saint Hymns. Then, in 1948, the Church published a\nrevised hymnal titled Hymns: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On\nthe 150th anniversary of Emma Smith\u2019s first hymnal in 1985, the Church\npublished a new hymnbook, which is used today, that includes many\nwell-known hymns from the Latter-day Saint tradition, a variety of\nhymns drawn from other Christian traditions, and many recently\ncomposed hymns. The Church publishes hymnals in dozens of\nlanguages, each containing roughly 200 hymns translated from English\nas well as familiar cultural and historical hymns specific to different\nparts of the world. The Church\u2019s hymnal for children\u2014Children\u2019s\nSongbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, first published in\n1989\u2014has also been translated into many languages.\nInspirational music continues to be an essential part of Latter-day Saint\nworship. Congregational hymns unify members, reinforce identity, and\nteach doctrine. In 1985, the First Presidency encouraged the use of\nhymns not only for the music quality, but also for the hymns\u2019 doctrinal\ncontent: \u201cWe hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called upon\nto speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented\npowerfully and beautifully in verse. \u2026 We hope the hymnbook will take\na prominent place among the scriptures and other religious books in\nour homes.\u201d 5\nChurch Resources\nEmma Smith, comp., Collection of Sacred Hymns, 1835, josephsmithpapers.org.\nFirst Presidency, \u201cPreface,\u201d Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt\nLake City, 1985), ix\u2013x.\nMichael F.

First, I know the gospel of Jesus Christ is true and that only by carefully listening to the words of our Prophet, by reading the scriptures for additional insight, and by living the commandments and suggestions of our Brethren can we find happiness of an eternal nature.\nSecond, I must communicate to you openly about the reality of my own inadequacies. Accepting a call to serve as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, I pray that the Lord, our Church leaders who sit before us, and you with whom I will be called to work will all exert untiring patience with me.\nLastly, I must communicate to you the awesome level of gratitude that I feel at this time: towards you who have so kindly instructed me through word and deed and action; to a lovely wife and children who have always supported their husband and father both here and in the mission field. To a father and mother who never needed to worry about determining priorities because they understood what was really important as easily as most of us find the act of breathing. I am grateful for a sister and brother and for their families. I am thankful for friends and associates who have been patient in their understanding of my weaknesses, of my lifestyle, and other decisions that have been made, as hopefully I was of theirs. I am so thankful to men like my mission president, A. Lewis Elgren, and to others such as President Harold B. Lee, Elder Richard L. Evans, a great aunt Bertha Irvine, and others who are no longer with us. I am so thankful to many of the Brethren who sit here, whose constant example has served as a motivating force in my life, and for so many others. Most of all I am grateful for a kind and loving Savior, who not only teaches us well but forgives and loves and persists.\nSpeaking for Anne, my wife; Larry, Annette, Marcus, Jonathan, Nathan, and Andrea, our children, we stand waiting to give all we have to the building of the kingdom, and hopefully make a supportive contribution wherever we might find ourselves.\nHenry Van Dyke said a number of years ago: \u201cThere is only one way to get ready for immortality, and that is to love this life and live it as bravely and faithfully and cheerfully, as we can.\u201d (In Emerson Roy West, Vital Quotations, Bookcraft, 1968, p. 201.) This I pray we may all do in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.\nHugh W. Pinnock\nThree Things to Share\n1977\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "The prophet Ezekiel declared:\n\u201cSon of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.\n\u201cWhen I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\n\u201cYet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d (Ezek. 3:17\u201319.)\nThe inspired Book of Mormon prophets saw our day and warned us of the strategy of the adversary. Hear their words:\n\u201cFor behold, at that day shall he [the devil] rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.\n\u201cAnd others will be pacify, and lull them away into carnal security. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God. \u2026\u201d (2 Ne. 28:20\u201321, 26.)\nThrough a modern prophet, Joseph Smith, the Lord has given this further warning: \u201cWherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear:\n\u201c\u2026 and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;\n\u201cFor they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;\n\u201cThey seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world. \u2026\n\u201cWhat I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice, or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.\u201d (D&C 1:11, 14\u201316, 38.)\nThese warnings were given 140 years ago. The fulfillment is now. We are living witnesses, unless we are blinded by our own complacency and the craftiness of evil men.\nAs watchmen on the tower of Zion, it is our obligation and right as leaders to speak out against current evils\u2014evils that strike at the very foundation of all we hold dear as the true church of Christ and as members of Christian nations.\nAs one of these watchmen, with a love for humanity, I accept humbly this obligation and challenge and gratefully strive to do my duty without fear. In times as serious as these, we must not permit fear of criticism to keep us from doing our duty, even at the risk of our counsel being tabbed as political, as government becomes more and more entwined in our daily lives.\nIn the crisis through which we are now passing, we have been fully warned. This has brought forth some criticism. There are some of us who do not want to hear the message. It embarrasses us. The things which are threatening our lives, our welfare, our freedoms are the very things some of us have been condoning. Many do not want to be disturbed as they continue to enjoy their comfortable complacency.\nThe Church is founded on eternal truth. We do not compromise principle. We do not surrender our standards regardless of current trends or pressures. Our allegiance to truth as a church is unwavering. Speaking out against immoral or unjust actions has been the burden of prophets and disciples of God from time immemorial. It was for this very reason that many of them were persecuted. Nevertheless, it was their God-given task, as watchmen on the tower, to warn the people.\nWe live in an age of appeasement\u2014the sacrificing of principle. Appeasement is not the answer. It is never the right answer.\nOne of these modern Church watchmen has given this sound warning:\n\u201cA milk-and-water allegiance kills; while a passionate devotion gives life and soul to any cause and its adherents. The troubles of the world may largely be laid at the doors of those who are neither hot nor cold; who always follow the line of least resistance; whose timid hearts flutter at taking sides for truth. As in the great Council in the heavens, so in the Church of Christ on earth, there can be no neutrality. We are, or we are not, on the side of the Lord. An unrelenting faith, contemptuous of all compromise, will lead the Church and every member of it, to triumph and the achievement of our high destiny.\n\u201cThe final conquerors of the world will be the men and women, few or many matters not, who fearlessly and unflinchingly cling to truth, and who are able to say no, as well as yes, on whose lofty banner is inscribed: No compromise with error. \u2026\u201d\n\u201cTolerance is not conformity to the world\u2019s view and practices. We must not surrender our beliefs to get along with people, however beloved or influential they may be. Too high a price may be paid for social standing or even for harmony. \u2026\nThe Gospel rests upon eternal truth; and truth can never be deserted safely.\u201d (John A. Widtsoe, Conference Report, April 1941, pp. 117, 116.)\nIt has been well said that \u201cour greatest national problem is erosion. Not erosion of the soil, but erosion of the national morality.\u201d\nThe United States of America has been great because it has been free. It has been free because it has trusted in God and was founded upon the principles of freedom set forth in the word of God. This nation has a spiritual foundation. To me, this land has a prophetic history.\nIn the year 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French historian, came to our country at the request of the French government to study our penal institutions. He also made a close study of our political and social institutions. In less than ten years, de Tocqueville had become world-famous, as the result of the four-volume work that he wrote, entitled Democracy in America. Here is his own stirring explanation of the greatness of America:\n\u201cI sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there; in her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there; in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there. Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\u201d (Prophets, Principles and National Survival, compiled by Jerreld L. Newquist [Salt Lake City, Publishers Press, 1964], p. 60.)\nHow strong is our will to remain free\u2014to be good? False thinking and false ideologies, dressed in the most pleasing forms, quietly\u2014almost without our knowing it\u2014seek to reduce our moral defenses and to captivate our minds. They entice with bright promises of security, cradle-to-grave guarantees of many kinds. They masquerade under various names, but all may be recognized by one thing\u2014one thing they all have in common: to erode away character and man\u2019s freedom to think and act for himself.\nEffort will be made to lull us away into a false security. Proposals will be and are being offered and programs sponsored that have wide appeal. Attractive labels are usually attached to the most dangerous programs, often in the name of public welfare and personal security. Again, let us not be misled.\nFreedom can be killed by neglect as well as by direct attack.\nToo long have too many Americans, and people of the free world generally, stood by as silent accessories to the crimes of assault against freedom\u2014assault against basic economic and spiritual principles and traditions that have made nations strong.\nLet us strive for progress down the road of goodness and freedom. With the help and blessings of the Lord, the free people of the United States and the free world can and will face tomorrow without fear, without doubt, and with full confidence. We do not fear the phony population explosion, nor do we fear a shortage of food, if we can be free and good. The Lord has declared, \u201c\u2026 the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare. \u2026\u201d (D&C 104:17.) We can accept this promise with confidence.\nPresident Calvin Coolidge pinpointed the problem some years ago with these words:\n\u201cWe do not need more material development, we need more spiritual development. We do not need more intellectual power, we need more moral power. We do not need more knowledge, we need more character. We do not need more government, we need more culture. We do not need more law, we need more religion. We do not need more of the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are unseen. It is on that side of life that it is desirable to put the emphasis at the present time. If that side is strengthened, the other side will take care of itself. It is that side which is the foundation of all else. If the foundation be firm, the superstructure will stand.\u201d (Prophets, Principles and National Survival, p. 35.)\nAs a free people, we are following very closely in many respects the pattern which led to the downfall of the great Roman Empire. A group of well-known historians has summarized those conditions leading to the downfall of Rome in these words:\n\u201c\u2026 Rome had known a pioneer beginning not unlike our own pioneer heritage, and then entered into two centuries of greatness, reaching its pinnacle in the second of those centuries, going into the decline and collapse in the third. Yet, the sins of decay were becoming apparent in the latter years of that second century.\n\u201cIt is written that there were vast increases in the number of the idle rich, and the idle poor. The latter (the idle poor) were put on a permanent dole, a welfare system not unlike our own. As this system became permanent, the recipients of public largesse (welfare) increased in number. They organized into a political block with sizable power. They were not hesitant about making their demands known. Nor was the government hesitant about agreeing to their demands \u2026 and with ever-increasing frequency. Would-be emperors catered to them. The great, solid middle class\u2014Rome\u2019s strength then as ours is today\u2014was taxed more and more to support a bureaucracy that kept growing larger, and even more powerful. Surtaxes were imposed upon incomes to meet emergencies. The government engaged in deficit spending. The denarius, a silver coin similar to our half dollar, began to lose its silvery hue. It took on a copper color as the government reduced the silver content.\n\u201cEven then, Gresham\u2019s law was at work, because the real silver coin soon disappeared. It went into hiding.\n\u201cMilitary service was an obligation highly honored by the Romans. Indeed, a foreigner could win Roman citizenship simply by volunteering for service in the legions of Rome. But, with increasing affluence and opulence, the young men of Rome began avoiding this service, finding excuses to remain in the soft and sordid life of the city. They took to using cosmetics and wearing feminine-like hairdo\u2019s and garments, until it became difficult, the historians tell us, to tell the sexes apart.\n\u201cAmong the teachers and scholars was a group called the Cynics whose number let their hair and beards grow, and who wore slovenly clothes, and professed indifference to worldly goods as they heaped scorn on what they called \u2018middle class values.\u2019\n\u201cThe morals declined. It became unsafe to walk in the countryside or the city streets. Rioting was commonplace and sometimes whole sections of towns and cities were burned.\n\u201cAnd, all the time, the twin diseases of confiscatory taxation and creeping inflation were waiting to deliver the death blow.\n\u201cThen finally, all these forces overcame the energy and ambition of the middle class.\n\u201cRome fell.\n\u201cWe are now approaching the end of our second century.\u201d (Address by Governor Ronald Reagan of California at Eisenhower College, New York, 1969.)\nIn 1787 Edward Gibbon completed his noble work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Here is the way he accounted for the fall:\nThe undermining of the dignity and sanctity of the home, which is the basis of human society.\nHigher and higher taxes and the spending of public monies for free bread and circuses for the populace.\nThe mad craze for pleasure, sports becoming every year more and more exciting and brutal.\nThe building of gigantic armaments when the real enemy was within the decadence of the people.\nThe decay of religion\u2014faith fading into mere form, losing touch with life, and becoming impotent to warn and guide the people.\nIs there a parallel for us in America today? Could the same reasons that destroyed Rome destroy America and possibly other countries of the free world?\nFor eight years in Washington I had this prayerful statement on my desk: \u201cO God, give us men with a mandate higher than the ballot box.\u201d\nThe lessons of history, many of them very sobering, ought to be turned to during this hour of our great achievements, because during the hour of our success is our greatest danger. Even during the hour of our great prosperity, a nation may sow the seeds of its own destruction. History reveals that rarely is a great civilization conquered from without unless it has weakened or destroyed itself within.\nThe lessons of history stand as guideposts to help us safely chart the course for the future.\nAs American citizens, as citizens of the nations of the free world, we need to rouse ourselves to the problems which confront us as great Christian nations. We must recognize that these fundamental, basic principles\u2014moral and spiritual\u2014lay at the very foundation of our past achievements. To continue to enjoy present blessings, we must return to these basic and fundamental principles. Economics and morals are both part of one inseparable body of truth. They must be in harmony. We need to square our actions with these eternal verities.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands firm in support of the great spiritual and moral principles which have been the basic traditions of the free world. We oppose every evil effort to downgrade or challenge the eternal verities which have undergirded civilization from the beginning.\nWe will use every honorable means to strengthen the home and family; to encourage obedience to the first and great commandment to multiply and replenish the earth through noble parenthood; and to strengthen character through adherence to high spiritual and moral principles.\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chastity will never be out of date. We have one standard for men and women, and that standard is moral purity. We oppose and abhor the damnable practice of wholesale abortion and every other unholy and impure act which strikes at the very foundation of the home and family, our most basic institutions.\nA continuation of these immoral practices will surely bring down the wrath and judgments of the Almighty.\nIn our concentration upon materialism and material acquisitions, are we forgetting the spiritual basis upon which our prosperity, security, and freedom rest? God help us to repent of our evil ways and humble ourselves before the offended power.\nThere is great safety in a nation on its knees.\nWhat assurance it would give of the much-needed blessings of the Lord if the American people, and people everywhere, could all be found daily\u2014night and morning\u2014on their knees expressing gratitude for blessings already received, acknowledging our dependence upon God, and seeking his divine guidance.\nThe spectacle of a nation praying is more awe-inspiring, more powerful, than the explosion of an atomic bomb. The force of prayer is greater than any possible combination of man-controlled powers, because \u201cprayer is man\u2019s greatest means of tapping the resources of God.\u201d The Founding Fathers accept this eternal verity. Do we? Will we?\nYes, it is in our own enlightened self-interest to engage in this simple practice, this powerful practice of prayer. Roger Babson said many years ago: \u201cWhat this country needs more than anything else is old-fashioned family prayer.\u201d Yes, our greatest need is a return to the old-fashioned, time-tested verities.\nGod help us, as free men, to recognize the source of our blessings, the threat to our freedom and our moral and spiritual standards, and the need for humble, yet courageous, action to preserve these priceless, time-tested blessings, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nEzra Taft Benson\n\u201cWatchman, Warn the Wicked\u201d\n1973\nFriday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 5:12 PM\nTithing\nTithing\nIn the early years of the Church, leaders sought to fund important\nprojects such as the publication of scriptures and the construction of\nthe Kirtland Temple through donations, business ventures, and other\nfundraising efforts. By July 1838, questions arose about the best way to\nmeet the Church\u2019s financial needs and the role donated funds should\nplay. 1 On July 8, Church leaders in Far West met together and\npetitioned the Lord to \u201cshow unto thy servants how much thou\nrequirest of the properties of thy people for a tithing.\u201d 2 Joseph Smith\nreceived two revelations about how much would be required and how\nthe funds should be administered.\nBefore this time, the words tithe and tithing as used in the Church\nreferred to any voluntary offering, regardless of the amount. Following\nan 1831 revelation to Joseph Smith on consecration and stewardship,\nSaints in Missouri and Ohio donated surplus goods, parcels of land,\ntools, furniture, and sometimes cash. 3 The Church\u2019s system for\nadministering donated resources varied. Sometimes the bishop used\nfunds to purchase land or to assist the poor and needy. For projects\nsuch as constructing buildings and printing Church literature, the\nUnited Firm or the high council managed donated funds. 4\nIn the July 8, 1838, revelation, the Lord answered the Saints\u2019 question\nwith these instructions: first, the Saints should make a one-time\ndonation of all their surplus property; \u201cand after that,\u201d the revelation\nsaid, \u201cthose who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their\ninterest annually.\u201d 5 An additional revelation given that day directed\nChurch leaders to establish a council that would be tasked with\ndeciding how to use these consecrated resources. This council originally\nincluded the members of the First Presidency, the bishop\u2019s council, and\nthe Far West high council. Today, the council is composed of the First\nPresidency, Quorum of the Twelve, and Presiding Bishopric and is\ncalled the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes. On July 26, 1838,\nthe council met for the first time, but persecutions in Missouri\nprevented the Saints from fully carrying out the directions of these\nrevelations in Far West. 6\nIn the early 1840s, Church leaders emphasized the payment of tithing to\nhelp build the Nauvoo Temple and made tithing a requirement for\naccess to the temple. This requirement was renewed in the 1880s when\ntemples were dedicated in Utah. Church debts mounted later in the\n19th century after the United States government seized the Church\u2019s\nassets in an attempt to pressure the Church to cease the practice of\nplural marriage, and some members became reluctant to pay tithing for\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/tithing?lang=eng\n1/44/8/23, 5:12 PM\nTithing\nfear their donations would be confiscated. 7 In 1899, almost a decade\nafter Church leaders reached an understanding with the\nU.S. government, the Church remained mired in debt. President\nLorenzo Snow received a divine manifestation during a sermon in the\ntabernacle in St. George, Utah, prompting him to emphasize obedience\nto the law of tithing. \u201cThe time has now come,\u201d he declared, \u201cfor every\nLatter-day Saint, who calculates to be prepared for the future and to\nhold his feet strong upon a proper foundation, to do the will of the\nLord and pay his tithing in full.\u201d 8 He traveled to settlements\nthroughout Utah, pleading with members to pay an honest tithe and\npromising both spiritual and temporal blessings. President Snow\u2019s\nefforts led to increased commitment, and within just a few years his\nsuccessor, Joseph F. Smith, was able to pay off the Church\u2019s debts. 9\nOver time, the Saints\u2019 tithing practices have changed as the economy\nand circumstances of the Saints have shifted. Initially, Church leaders\napplied a complex formula to calculate how much tithing the Saints\nowed. By the 1840s, however, this was simplified to a requirement to pay\none-tenth of their increase or income. 10 The methods of paying tithing\nlikewise shifted over time. In the 19th century, Saints often made in-\nkind donations, such as animals or produce. Starting in Nauvoo, many\nSaints in Nauvoo donated one day in ten to work on the temple or other\nChurch projects. Church offices in Nauvoo and Salt Lake City had a\ntithing office and yard that served as places to store donated goods,\nsuch as grain, vegetables, merchandise, cut stone, lumber shingles, and\nlivestock. 11 In outlying settlements, local bishops\u2019 storehouses were\nsimilarly used to pool the community\u2019s resources. 12 In calculating their\nannual tenth as outlined in the 1838 revelation, Church members\nsometimes counted things like land appreciation as increase since many\npeople were not earning wages. In the 20th century, cash earnings and\ndonations became more common. 13 Throughout these changes, tithing\nhas remained one of the most conspicuous ways that Latter-day Saints\nfulfill the commandment to consecrate their lives to God\u2019s work. Today,\ntithing funds are used, among other things, to build temples and\nmeetinghouses, support family history research, share the gospel with\nothers, and provide humanitarian service.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/tithing?lang=eng\n2/44/8/23, 5:12 PM\nTithing\nChurch Resources\n\u201cPart 2: 8 July\u201329 October 1838,\u201d in Mark Ashurst-McGee, David W.

One of his cows died, leaving a newborn calf, which he gave to me. I took care of the calf, fed it, and raised it. The day my dad took it to the stockyards to be sold was a day of mixed emotions for me: I had grown attached to my calf, and yet I was looking forward to receiving the rewards of my labor. My only request was that the money I received from selling the calf be in silver dollars. I remember Dad coming home that night and dropping 20 silver dollars into my hands. Money was hard to come by, and I thought I had all the money in the world. I counted, admired, and polished each coin carefully. When Sunday came, I reluctantly put two shiny coins into my pocket to pay my tithing. As hard as it was to surrender my precious silver dollars to the bishop, I still remember now how good I felt being obedient to the Lord.\nOn the way home from church, my mother told me how proud she was of me. Then she said, \u201cYour grandfather always told us children that if we would faithfully pay an honest tithing, the Lord would bless us and it would be the best investment that we could ever make.\u201d\nMy grandfather understood that \u201cthere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated\u2014and when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\u201d1 Tithing is a commandment from God, and when we obey His law, He is bound to bless us. Even as a seven-year-old boy, that was something I could understand. President Thomas S. Monson, in speaking about God\u2019s laws, stated: \u201cViolate them and we suffer lasting consequences. Obey them and we reap everlasting joy.\u201d2\nYou\u2019ll remember that when Israel was chastened for robbing God, the people asked, \u201cWherein have we robbed thee?\u201d The answer came, \u201cIn tithes and offerings.\u201d And then the Israelites were promised that if they would obey His law of tithing, they would be entitled to receive His blessings. The Lord said, \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse \u2026 and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d3\nThe Lord asked Israel to prove Him, to test Him, to have faith in Him so that He would be able to keep His promise to them. That same commandment and that same promise are in effect today. When we keep the law of the tithe, the Lord\u2019s promise is sure: blessings will come to us both temporally and spiritually, according to the wisdom and timing of the Lord.\nMy wife, Joan, and I have had the privilege of living in various parts of the world among wonderful people who rely daily on the Lord for their most basic temporal needs. Those who take the leap of faith to pay their tithing testify that the windows of heaven are opened to them. I remember a faithful father in the Philippines telling of paying his meager tithing to the bishop one Sunday and then leading his children home from church, knowing full well that there was no food for them. As they were walking along, a huge breadfruit dropped from a tree right in front of them. He immediately looked up and thanked God for opening the windows of heaven and sending him a breadfruit to feed his children.\nWe are living in challenging economic times. However, if we look back over the past years, we find there have been, and will continue to be, times of relative prosperity and times of financial uncertainty. But regardless of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, if we first pay our obligation to the Lord and then use wisdom and good judgment, the Lord will help us manage the resources He has given us.\nPresident Heber J. Grant stated, \u201cI want to say to you, if you will be honest with the Lord, paying your tithing and keeping His commandments, He will not only bless you with the light and inspiration of His Holy Spirit, but you will be blessed in dollars and cents; you will be enabled to pay your debts, and the Lord will pour out temporal blessings upon you in great abundance.\u201d4\nIn 1936, at the height of the Great Depression in the United States, when people were struggling to make ends meet, Elder John A. Widtsoe admonished the Saints to pay their tithing because of the spiritual blessings they would receive. He said: \u201cObedience to the law of tithing \u2026 brings a deep, inward joy \u2026 that can be won in no other way. \u2026 The principles of truth become clearer. \u2026 Prayer becomes easier. \u2026 The spiritual sense is sharpened [and] \u2026 man becomes more like his Father in Heaven.\u201d5\nA mother in West Africa shared her testimony about tithing. She was a trader in a marketplace. Every day she would come home, count out her tithing, and put it in a special place. Then on Sunday she would faithfully take it to her bishop. She shared with us how her business had grown and how her family had been blessed with health and strength and enough food to eat. Then with tears in her eyes she said, \u201cBut the greatest blessings of all are that my children love the Lord and we are a forever family.\u201d\nThis humble mother understood that one of the great blessings of being a full-tithe payer is the privilege of entering the house of the Lord and participating in the sacred ordinances that enable families to be together forever.\nAs we faithfully pay our tithes, the Lord will indeed open the windows of heaven and pour us out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. I want each of you to know, and especially my children and grandchildren, that I know, as my grandfather did, that if you always pay an honest tithing, the Lord will bless you. It will be the best investment you will ever make. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nElder Sheldon F. Child\nThe Best Investment\n2008\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "All of us who are under the baptismal covenant have promised to offer the gospel to others.1 Sometimes, fear of rejection or of giving offense looms before us like an impassable obstacle. Yet some members clear that barrier with ease. I have observed them carefully in my travels. I can picture some of them now.\nSaturday is a market day across the world. In the countryside of Ghana, in Ecuador, and in the Philippine Islands, countless people bring the produce of their farms and their handicrafts to a town to sell. They talk with those they meet on the road. And they visit with those near them as they wait for someone to buy. Much of the talk is about the struggles of existence, of breaking out of poverty, and sometimes about danger.\nAmong those on the roads and in the markets are Latter-day Saints. Much of their talk with those they meet would be the same as you would hear anywhere in the world. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cIs that your son with you?\u201d \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d But there will be a difference in the Latter-day Saints. It would be noticeable in their eyes as much as in their words. They listen carefully with the look of someone who cares about the answers to questions and who cares about the person.\nIf the conversation lasts more than a few minutes, it would turn to things that matter deeply to both of them. They would talk of what they believe brings happiness and what brings sadness. And the talk would turn to hopes for this life and the next. The Latter-day Saint would express quiet assurance. Not every time, but sometimes, the Latter-day Saint would be asked, \u201cWhy are you so much at peace?\u201d \u201cHow do you know these things you say you know?\u201d\nAnd then there would come a quiet answer. Perhaps it would be about Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appearing to the young boy Joseph Smith. It might be about the resurrected Savior\u2019s loving ministry, as described in the Book of Mormon, to common people who had faith in Him and who loved Him as we do.\nIf you could hear such a conversation, which reaches spiritual things in a marketplace or on a street, you might ask: \u201cHow could I do that? How could I become better at sharing my faith with those who do not yet feel what I feel?\u201d It is a question for each of us who are members. That same question is on the mind of every bishop and branch president in the Church who now has the charge to lead missionary work among his people. The answer to that question is at the heart of the harvest which will come.\nI\u2019ve studied carefully and prayerfully some who are remarkably faithful and effective witnesses of the Savior and His Church. Their stories are inspiring. One humble man was called as the president of a tiny branch. There were so few members he could not see how the branch could function. He walked into a grove of trees to pray. He asked God what he should do. An answer came. He and the few members began inviting friends to join with them. In a year, hundreds had come into the waters of baptism and become fellow citizens in the Lord\u2019s Church.\nI know a man who travels almost every week in his work. On any day there are missionaries somewhere in the world teaching someone he met. There is another man who seems undeterred by how many he must speak to before any of them wish to be taught by the missionaries. He doesn\u2019t count the cost in his effort but only the happiness of those whose lives are changed.\nThere is no single pattern in what they do. There is no common technique. Some always carry a Book of Mormon to give away. Others set a date to find someone for the missionaries to teach. Another has found questions which draw out feelings about what matters most in life to a person. Each has prayed to know what to do. They each seem to get a different answer, suited especially to them and to the people they meet.\nBut in one way they are all alike. It is this: they have a common way of seeing who they are. They can do what they have been inspired to do because of who they are. To do what we are to do, we will have to become like them in at least two ways. First, they feel that they are the beloved children of a loving Heavenly Father. Because of that they turn to Him easily and often in prayer. They expect to receive His personal direction. They obey in meekness and humility, as the children of a perfect parent. He is close to them.\nSecond, they are the grateful disciples of the resurrected Jesus Christ. They know for themselves that the Atonement is real and necessary for all. They have felt cleansed through baptism by those in authority and the receipt of the Holy Ghost for themselves. And because of the peace they have experienced, they are like the sons of Mosiah, \u201cdesirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.\u201d2\nThose who speak easily and often of the restored gospel prize what it has meant to them. They think of that great blessing often. It is the memory of the gift they have received which makes them eager for others to receive it. They have felt the love of the Savior. For them these words are their daily, hourly reality:\n\u201cThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.\n\u201cWe love him, because he first loved us.\u201d3\nEven having felt that love, the true disciple sometimes feels anxiety. The Apostle John was clear about that: fear will be gone when we are made perfect in love. We can pray for that gift of perfect love. We can pray with confidence that we can feel the Savior\u2019s love for us and for all we meet. He loved us and them enough to pay the price of all our sins. It is one thing to believe that. It is something far more to have our hearts changed to feel it every moment. The command to pray to feel the Savior\u2019s love is also a promise. Listen:\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail\u2014\n\u201cBut charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.\u201d4\nThe Lord trusts His true disciples. He sends prepared people to His prepared servants. You have had the experience, as have I, of meeting people where you were sure the meeting could not have been by chance.\nI have a friend who prays every day to meet someone who is prepared to receive the gospel. He carries with him a copy of the Book of Mormon. The night before a short trip recently, he decided not to take a copy with him but instead to carry what is called a pass-along card. But in the morning, a spiritual impression came: \u201cTake a Book of Mormon with you.\u201d He put one in his bag.\nA woman he knew sat next to him on the plane, and he wondered, \u201cIs this the one?\u201d She rode with him again on the return trip. Now he thought, \u201cHow should I bring the gospel up?\u201d\nInstead, she said to him, \u201cYou pay tithing to your Church, don\u2019t you?\u201d He said that he did. She said that she was supposed to pay tithing to her church but she didn\u2019t. And then she said, \u201cWhat is this about the Book of Mormon?\u201d He explained that it was scripture, another witness of Jesus Christ, translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith. She seemed interested. So he reached down into his bag and said: \u201cI was impressed to bring this book with me. I think it is for you.\u201d\nShe began to read it. As they parted, she said, \u201cYou and I are going to have to have more conversations about this.\u201d What my friend could not know, but God did, was that she was looking for a church. God knew she had watched my friend and wondered what about his church made him so happy. God knew she would ask about the Book of Mormon, and He knew she would be willing to be taught by the missionaries. She was prepared. So was my friend. And so can you and I be.\nYour worthiness and your desire will shine in your face and your eyes. You will be excited about the Lord\u2019s Church and His work, and it will show. You will be His disciple 24 hours a day in every situation. You won\u2019t need to build up your courage for one great moment to speak to someone and then retreat. The fact that most people are not interested in the restored gospel will have little bearing on what you do and say. Speaking what you believe will be part of what you are.\nMy father was like that. He was a scientist. He lectured to audiences in countries around the world. Once I read a talk he had given to a large scientific convention. In it, he referred to creation and a Creator as he talked about his science. I knew that few, if any, in that audience would have shared his faith. So I said to him with wonder and admiration, \u201cDad, you bore your testimony.\u201d He looked at me with surprise on his face and said, \u201cDid I?\u201d\nHe had not even known that he was being brave. He simply said what he knew was true. When he bore testimony, even those who rejected it knew it came not by design but because it was part of him. He was what he was, wherever he was.\nThat is the mark of every person who is bold and effective in sharing the gospel. They see themselves as children of a loving, living Father in Heaven. And they see themselves as disciples of Jesus Christ. It takes no discipline for them to pray. They do it naturally. It is no special effort to remember the Savior. His love for them and theirs for Him is always with them. That is who they are and how they see themselves and see those around them.\nNow that may seem to us to require a great change, but we can be confident that it will come. The change in individual members is happening across the Church in every nation. This is the great time foreseen by prophets since the Creation. The restored gospel will go to every nation. The Savior sent these words to the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n\u201cI have sent forth mine angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, who hath appeared unto some and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear unto many that dwell on the earth.\n\u201cAnd this gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\u201d5\nWhatever tumults occur, we can know that God will set bounds to fulfill His promises. He, not just men, has the ultimate control of nations and of events to allow His purposes to be fulfilled. Among every people and every nation there will be raised up those who serve with absolute assurance that they are children of God and who have become purified disciples of the resurrected Christ in His Church.\nA few years ago I spoke to the missionaries in the training center in Japan. I promised them then that a great day would dawn in that nation. I said that there would be a great increase in the members speaking eagerly to those they met of their testimony of the restored gospel. My thought then was that the courage to speak would come from an increased admiration for the Church in that land. I know now that the great miracle, a mighty change, will come inside the members, not in the world around them.\nThey and members across the earth will love and listen and talk and testify out of changed hearts. Bishops and branch presidents will lead them by example. The harvest of souls will be great, and it will be safe in the Lord\u2019s hands.6\nTo be part of that miracle, you must not wait until you feel closer to Heavenly Father or until you are sure that you have been purified through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Pray for the chance to encounter people who sense there could be something better in their lives. Pray to know what you should do to help them. Your prayers will be answered. You will meet people prepared by the Lord. You will find yourself feeling and saying things beyond your past experience. And then in time you will feel yourself drawing closer to your Heavenly Father, and you will feel the cleansing and the forgiveness the Savior promises His faithful witnesses. And you will feel His approval, knowing you have done what He asked of you, because He loves you and trusts you.\nI am grateful to live in such a time. I am grateful to know that you and I are loved children of a glorified Heavenly Father. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, that He is my Savior and yours and the Savior of all the people you will ever meet. The Father and the Son came to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The keys of the priesthood were restored, and the last, great gathering has begun. I know that is true.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nHenry B. Eyring\nA Child and a Disciple\n2003\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "His Visit\nOne of the most remarkable and tender experiences recorded in holy scripture is the account of the visit of the Savior to people in the Americas following His death and Resurrection. The people had suffered a destruction so great that it caused \u201cthe whole earth [to become] deformed.\u201d1 The record of those events relates that following the catastrophe, all the people wept continually,2 and in the midst of their deep grief, they hungered for healing, peace, and deliverance.\nWhen the Savior descended from heaven, the people twice fell at His feet. The first time occurred after He pronounced, with divine authority:\n\u201cBehold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.\n\u201cAnd behold, I am the light and the life of the world.\u201d3\nHe then invited those present to \u201carise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cAnd when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:\n\u201cHosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God!\u201d4\nAnd then, for a second time, \u201cthey did fall down at the feet of Jesus.\u201d But this time with purpose, for we learn that they \u201cdid worship him.\u201d5\nPresent Day\nEarlier this year I was on assignment visiting a stake in the western United States. It was a normal Sunday, a normal meeting, with normal members of the Church. I watched as people entered the chapel and reverently moved to available seats. Last-second, whispered conversations echoed throughout the hall. Mothers and fathers tried\u2014sometimes in vain\u2014to quiet energetic children. Normal.\nBut then, before the meeting began, words inspired of the Spirit came into my mind.\nThese members had not come just to fulfill a duty or listen to speakers.\nThey had come for a deeper and far more significant reason.\nThey had come to worship.\nAs the meeting progressed, I observed various members in the congregation. They had an almost heavenly expression, an attitude of reverence and peace. Something about them warmed my heart. The experience they were having that Sunday was something quite extraordinary.\nThey were worshipping.\nThey were experiencing heaven.\nI could see it in their countenances.\nAnd I rejoiced and worshipped with them. And as I did so, the Spirit spoke to my heart. And on that day, I learned something about myself, about God, and about the role of true worship in our lives.\nWorship in Our Everyday Lives\nLatter-day Saints are exceptional when it comes to serving in Church callings. But sometimes we may go about our work routinely, as though we are merely performing a job. Sometimes our attendance at meetings and our service in the kingdom may lack the holy element of worship. And without that, we are missing an incomparable spiritual encounter with the infinite\u2014one we are entitled to as children of a loving Heavenly Father.\nFar from being an accidental, happy occurrence, worship is essential and central to our spiritual life. It is something we should yearn for, seek out, and strive to experience.\nWhat Is Worship?\nWhen we worship God, we approach Him with reverent love, humility, and adoration. We acknowledge and accept Him as our sovereign King, the Creator of the universe, our beloved and infinitely loving Father.\nWe respect and revere Him.\nWe submit ourselves to Him.\nWe lift our hearts in mighty prayer, cherish His word, rejoice in His grace, and commit to follow Him with dedicated loyalty.\nWorshipping God is such an essential element in the life of a disciple of Jesus Christ that if we fail to receive Him in our hearts, we will seek for Him in vain in our councils, churches, and temples.\nTrue disciples are drawn to \u201cworship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters\u2014calling upon the name of the Lord day and night.\u201d6\nWe can learn much about true worship by examining how others\u2014people who perhaps were not so different from ourselves\u2014encountered, behaved, and worshipped in the presence of the divine.\nWonder, Gratitude, and Hope\nIn the first part of the 19th century, the Christian world had all but abandoned the idea that God still spoke to man. But in the spring of 1820, that changed\u00a0forever when a humble farm boy entered a grove of trees and knelt to pray. From that day on, a stream of remarkable visions, revelations, and heavenly appearances have bathed the earth, endowing its inhabitants with precious knowledge regarding the nature and purpose of God and His relationship with man.\nOliver Cowdery described those days as \u201cnever to be forgotten. \u2026 What joy! what wonder! what amazement!\u201d7\nOliver\u2019s words convey the first elements that accompany true worship of the divine\u2014a sense of majestic awe and profound thanksgiving.\nEvery day, but especially on the Sabbath day, we have the extraordinary opportunity to experience the wonder and awe of heaven and offer our praises to God for His blessed goodness and overwhelming mercy.\nThis will lead us to hope. These are the first elements of worship.\nLight, Knowledge, and Faith\nOn the blessed day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit entered into the hearts and minds of the disciples of Christ, filling them with light and knowledge.\nUntil that day they were at times unsure of what they should do. Jerusalem had become a dangerous place for a follower of the Savior, and they must have wondered what would become of them.\nBut when the Holy Spirit filled their hearts, doubt and reluctance vanished. Through the transcendent experience of true worship, the Saints of God received heavenly light, knowledge, and a strengthened testimony. And that led to faith.\nFrom that moment on, the Apostles and Saints acted with determined direction. With boldness they preached Christ Jesus to all the world.\nWhen we worship in spirit, we invite light and truth into our souls, which strengthens our faith. These too are necessary elements of true worship.\nDiscipleship and Charity\nIn the Book of Mormon we learn that from the moment Alma the Younger was delivered from suffering the consequences of his own rebelliousness, he was never the same. He boldly \u201ctraveled throughout all the land \u2026 and among all the people \u2026\u00a0, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which [he] had done to the church.\u201d8\nHis constant worship of the Almighty God took the form of energetic discipleship.\nTrue worship transforms us into sincere and earnest disciples of our beloved Master and Savior, Jesus Christ. We change and become more like Him.\nWe become more understanding and caring. More forgiving. More loving.\nWe understand that it is impossible to say that we love God while at the same time hating, dismissing, or disregarding others around us.9\nTrue worship leads to an unwavering determination to walk the path of discipleship. And that leads inevitably to charity. These too are necessary elements of worship.\nEnter into His Gates with Thanksgiving\nWhen I reflect back on what began as a normal Sunday morning, in that normal meetinghouse, in that normal stake, even today I am moved by that extraordinary spiritual experience that will forever bless my life.\nI learned that even if we are exceptional managers of our time, callings, and assignments\u2014even if we check all the boxes on our list of the \u201cperfect\u201d individual, family, or leader\u2014if we fail to worship our merciful Deliverer, heavenly King, and glorious God, we are missing much of the joy and peace of the gospel.\nWhen we worship God, we acknowledge and receive Him with the same reverence as those ancient people of the Americas. We approach Him with incomprehensible feelings of wonder and awe. We marvel in gratitude at the goodness of God. And thus, we acquire hope.\nWe ponder God\u2019s word, and that fills our souls with light and truth. We comprehend spiritual vistas that can be seen only through the light of the Holy Ghost.10 And thus, we acquire faith.\nAs we worship, our souls are refined and we commit to walk in the footsteps of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ. And from this resolve, we acquire charity.\nWhen we worship, our hearts are drawn out in praise to our blessed God morning, noon, and night.\nWe hallow and honor Him continually\u2014in our meetinghouses, homes, temples, and all our labors.\nWhen we worship, we open our hearts to the healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nOur lives become the token and expression of our worship.\nMy brothers and sisters, spiritual experiences have less to do with what is happening around us and everything to do with what is happening within our hearts. It is my witness that true worship will transform ordinary Church meetings into extraordinary spiritual feasts. It will enrich our lives, broaden our understanding, and strengthen our testimonies. For as we incline our hearts to God, like the ancient Psalmist, we \u201center into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: [we are] thankful unto him, and bless his name.\n\u201cFor the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.\u201d11\nThrough sincere and heartfelt worship, we blossom and mature in hope, faith, and charity. And through that process, we gather heavenly light into our souls that infuses our lives with divine meaning, abiding peace, and everlasting joy.\nThat is the blessing of worship in our lives. Of this I humbly testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Bishop Dean\u00a0M. Davies\nThe Blessings of Worship\n2016\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "As Elder Ballard noted earlier in this session, various cross-currents of our times have brought increasing public attention to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Lord told the ancients this latter-day work would be \u201ca marvellous work and a wonder,\u201d1 and it is. But even as we invite one and all to examine closely the marvel of it, there is one thing we would not like anyone to wonder about\u2014that is whether or not we are \u201cChristians.\u201d\nBy and large any controversy in this matter has swirled around two doctrinal issues\u2014our view of the Godhead and our belief in the principle of continuing revelation leading to an open scriptural canon. In addressing this we do not need to be apologists for our faith, but we would like not to be misunderstood. So with a desire to increase understanding and unequivocally declare our Christianity, I speak today on the first of those two doctrinal issues just mentioned.\nOur first and foremost article of faith in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \u201cWe believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\u201d2 We believe these three divine persons constituting a single Godhead are united in purpose, in manner, in testimony, in mission. We believe Them to be filled with the same godly sense of mercy and love, justice and grace, patience, forgiveness, and redemption. I think it is accurate to say we believe They are one in every significant and eternal aspect imaginable except believing Them to be three persons combined in one substance, a Trinitarian notion never set forth in the scriptures because it is not true.\nIndeed no less a source than the stalwart Harper\u2019s Bible Dictionary records that \u201cthe formal doctrine of the Trinity as it was defined by the great church councils of the fourth and fifth centuries is not to be found in the [New Testament].\u201d3\nSo any criticism that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not hold the contemporary Christian view of God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost is not a comment about our commitment to Christ but rather a recognition (accurate, I might add) that our view of the Godhead breaks with post\u2013New Testament Christian history and returns to the doctrine taught by Jesus Himself. Now, a word about that post\u2013New Testament history might be helpful.\nIn the year A.D. 325 the Roman emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea to address\u2014among other things\u2014the growing issue of God\u2019s alleged \u201ctrinity in unity.\u201d What emerged from the heated contentions of churchmen, philosophers, and ecclesiastical dignitaries came to be known (after another 125 years and three more major councils)4 as the Nicene Creed, with later reformulations such as the Athanasian Creed. These various evolutions and iterations of creeds\u2014and others to come over the centuries\u2014declared the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be abstract, absolute, transcendent, immanent, consubstantial, coeternal, and unknowable, without body, parts, or passions and dwelling outside space and time. In such creeds all three members are separate persons, but they are a single being, the oft-noted \u201cmystery of the trinity.\u201d They are three distinct persons, yet not three Gods but one. All three persons are incomprehensible, yet it is one God who is incomprehensible.\nWe agree with our critics on at least that point\u2014that such a formulation for divinity is truly incomprehensible. With such a confusing definition of God being imposed upon the church, little wonder that a fourth-century monk cried out, \u201cWoe is me! They have taken my God away from me, \u2026 and I know not whom to adore or to address.\u201d5 How are we to trust, love, worship, to say nothing of strive to be like, One who is incomprehensible and unknowable? What of Jesus\u2019s prayer to His Father in Heaven that \u201cthis is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d?6\nIt is not our purpose to demean any person\u2019s belief nor the doctrine of any religion. We extend to all the same respect for their doctrine that we are asking for ours. (That, too, is an article of our faith.) But if one says we are not Christians because we do not hold a fourth- or fifth-century view of the Godhead, then what of those first Christian Saints, many of whom were eyewitnesses of the living Christ, who did not hold such a view either?7\nWe declare it is self-evident from the scriptures that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are separate persons, three divine beings, noting such unequivocal illustrations as the Savior\u2019s great Intercessory Prayer just mentioned, His baptism at the hands of John, the experience on the Mount of Transfiguration, and the martyrdom of Stephen\u2014to name just four.\nWith these New Testament sources and more8 ringing in our ears, it may be redundant to ask what Jesus meant when He said, \u201cThe Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do.\u201d9 On another occasion He said, \u201cI came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.\u201d10 Of His antagonists He said, \u201c[They have] \u2026 seen and hated both me and my Father.\u201d11 And there is, of course, that always deferential subordination to His Father that had Jesus say, \u201cWhy callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.\u201d12 \u201cMy father is greater than I.\u201d13\nTo whom was Jesus pleading so fervently all those years, including in such anguished cries as \u201cO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me\u201d14 and \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me\u201d?15 To acknowledge the scriptural evidence that otherwise perfectly united members of the Godhead are nevertheless separate and distinct beings is not to be guilty of polytheism; it is, rather, part of the great revelation Jesus came to deliver concerning the nature of divine beings. Perhaps the Apostle Paul said it best: \u201cChrist Jesus \u2026 being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\u201d16\nA related reason The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is excluded from the Christian category by some is because we believe, as did the ancient prophets and apostles, in an embodied\u2014but certainly glorified\u2014God.17 To those who criticize this scripturally based belief, I ask at least rhetorically: If the idea of an embodied God is repugnant, why are the central doctrines and singularly most distinguishing characteristics of all Christianity the Incarnation, the Atonement, and the physical Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ? If having a body is not only not needed but not desirable by Deity, why did the Redeemer of mankind redeem His body, redeeming it from the grasp of death and the grave, guaranteeing it would never again be separated from His spirit in time or eternity?18Any who dismiss the concept of an embodied God dismiss both the mortal and the resurrected Christ. No one claiming to be a true Christian will want to do that.\nNow, to anyone within the sound of my voice who has wondered regarding our Christianity, I bear this witness. I testify that Jesus Christ is the literal, living Son of our literal, living God. This Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer who, under the guidance of the Father, was the Creator of heaven and earth and all things that in them are. I bear witness that He was born of a virgin mother, that in His lifetime He performed mighty miracles observed by legions of His disciples and by His enemies as well. I testify that He had power over death because He was divine but that He willingly subjected Himself to death for our sake because for a period of time He was also mortal. I declare that in His willing submission to death He took upon Himself the sins of the world, paying an infinite price for every sorrow and sickness, every heartache and unhappiness from Adam to the end of the world. In doing so He conquered both the grave physically and hell spiritually and set the human family free. I bear witness that He was literally resurrected from the tomb and, after ascending to His Father to complete the process of that Resurrection, He appeared, repeatedly, to hundreds of disciples in the Old World and in the New. I know He is the Holy One of Israel, the Messiah who will one day come again in final glory, to reign on earth as Lord of lords and King of kings. I know that there is no other name given under heaven whereby a man can be saved and that only by relying wholly upon His merits, mercy, and everlasting grace19 can we gain eternal life.\nMy additional testimony regarding this resplendent doctrine is that in preparation for His millennial latter-day reign, Jesus has already come, more than once, in embodied majestic glory. In the spring of 1820, a 14-year-old boy, confused by many of these very doctrines that still confuse much of Christendom, went into a grove of trees to pray. In answer to that earnest prayer offered at such a tender age, the Father and the Son appeared as embodied, glorified beings to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. That day marked the beginning of the return of the true, New Testament gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and the restoration of other prophetic truths offered from Adam down to the present day.\nI testify that my witness of these things is true and that the heavens are open to all who seek the same confirmation. Through the Holy Spirit of Truth, may we all know \u201cthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [He has] sent.\u201d20 Then may we live Their teachings and be true Christians in deed, as well as in word, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJeffrey\u00a0R. Holland\nThe Only True God and Jesus Christ Whom He Hath Sent\n2007\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "One of the great blessings of my childhood was that my mother spent significant time reading to me and my younger brother Howard. She had a great sense of the importance of good books, and she used them to teach and entertain us. This all served to expand our limited young lives to matters far beyond our daily experience. The reading had begun when I was a runabout preschooler and Howard, who had been born with severe physical disabilities and could not run about, needed special attention. The blessing for me was that I got special attention, too.\nThe books were wide-ranging and grew in sophistication as we grew. I remember nursery rhymes, poetry, folktales from Russia, the adventure in Thunder Cave\u2014and the scriptures. Together, we read parables, incidents such as the woman at the well, even the great abstractions.\nOne day Mother read: \u201cCharity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. \u2026\n\u201cBeareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\n\u201cCharity never faileth.\u201d (1 Cor. 13:4, 7\u20138; see also Moro. 7:45\u201346.)\nHoward interrupted the reading, as he often did, with a question, \u201cWhat is charity?\u201d He wanted to know the meaning of what we had just heard; I was still caught up in the way it sounded. I only wanted to go on with the reading, but I could tell Mother was pleased with his inquisitiveness. She taught us then, and later, that good questions can be important if we are truly searching to understand, and that sometimes good answers that are good enough may take a lifetime of looking. Then she put down the New Testament and read from the Book of Mormon:\n\u201cBut charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him [or her].\u201d (Moro. 7:47.)\nThere it was, in one verse, the concentrated essence of a much larger whole, a definition given for a profound yet available truth. What I heard that day was clearly beyond my childhood comprehension, but the spirit of love was there and was as real as any of the other details of my young life.\nThe scriptures give us examples of other questioners whose queries taught them new ways to think about love. In the twenty-second chapter of Matthew, Christ was asked by a Pharisee who wanted to trick him, what was the greatest commandment. Christ answered, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. \u2026\n\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d (Matt. 22:37, 39.)\nIn Luke\u2019s record, the lawyer who had asked the question wanted to know more. Perhaps he feared he might waste his love, so he asked, \u201cWho is my neighbour?\u201d (Luke 10:29.) And Christ gave the parable of the good Samaritan as an answer. The Samaritan saw what others with eyes had walked by without seeing. He did what he could do that no one else would do, and he dignified himself and put us all in awe of him because we didn\u2019t expect the Samaritan to be our neighbor. (See Luke 10:30\u201337.) We wouldn\u2019t tempt Christ by asking him whom we should love or serve, but I think occasionally we wonder if we really know.\nIt is interesting to me that Jesus chose a Samaritan as an example of love unfeigned for the Pharisees. They were so remarkable for their observance of the letter of the law that this teaching must have caused at least some of them to see in new ways and with new spirit the freedom to love that Christ was offering them. That is the challenge for us, to allow Christ\u2019s teachings, magnified by the Holy Spirit, to guide us to his ways of seeing and being.\nNow, understanding charity or being charitable is not easy. And our scriptures have not indicated that it would be. Even \u201ccharity suffereth long\u201d requires our thoughtful interpretation. The \u201csuffering\u201d that may come from loving is the result of our great caring. It comes because another matters to us so much.\nTo avoid that kind of suffering, we would have to avoid what gives us life and hope and joy\u2014our capacity to love deeply. As an antidote against the suffering that will surely come as we have loved ones die, or see them struggle or be misled, or have them misunderstand us or even betray us, we can find relief in charity to others. We accepted bearing one another\u2019s burdens and mourning with those who mourn, as we accepted Christ in our baptism. (See Mosiah 18:8\u20139.) His spirit and power will comfort us as we extend ourselves in help and love to those who need us.\nIf charity is not always quick to our understanding, it may occasionally be quick to our misunderstanding. It is not charity or kindness to endure any type of abuse or unrighteousness that may be inflicted on us by others. God\u2019s commandment that as we love him, we must respect ourselves, suggests we must not accept disrespect from others. It is not charity to let another repeatedly deny our divine nature and agency. It is not charity to bow down in despair and helplessness. That kind of suffering should be ended, and that is very difficult to do alone. There are priesthood leaders and other loving servants who will give aid and strength when they know of the need. We must be willing to let others help us.\nA striking feature of the effect of a deepened understanding of Christ\u2019s love is how such comprehension dignifies and lifts the individual to action. Julia Mavimbela, a Church member in Soweto, South Africa, tells how her conversion brought her from bitterness at her life\u2019s circumstances to faith and strength to help those around her and beyond her. She taught gardening to relieve hunger, and she organized women for peace to calm their strife-torn country.\nIn Thailand in the late 1970s, Sister Srilaxana worked as a translator of the scriptures five days a week and then traveled throughout her country at her own expense each weekend, visiting fledgling Relief Societies. These followers of Christ did what it was in their souls, to do to serve God\u2019s children. They did what their individuality permitted, and their examples invite us to do the same.\nCharitable, compassionate service is the central mission of our church\u2019s Relief Society organization. We are now nearly three million members worldwide, and we rejoice in our great, diversified sisterhood. We know that our society, which marks its 150th anniversary next year, has accomplished much good. We have learned that we can do many things together that would be impossible if we worked alone. But our major focus, as a society, is to bless the individual woman as she grows in her knowledge of Christ\u2019s gospel and reflects her knowledge by the choices she makes to serve others in righteousness.\nAt last October\u2019s conference, Bishop Glenn L. Pace admonished all of us to look around us to do what we could as individuals to relieve pain, or loneliness, or injustice in our own communities. He promised that if we did, a compassion would enter our hearts, and through the Holy Ghost sanctification could take place within our souls, and we would become more like our Savior. (See Ensign, Nov. 1990, pp. 8\u201310.)\nI pray in all humility that our faith in God may move us to such action and that we may thus know, by the Holy Spirit, the meaning of charity so that we can exercise it in our lives, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.\nAileen H. Clyde\n\u201cCharity Suffereth Long\u201d\n1991\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Recently I had an engaging conversation with a young man who was contemplating a mission. As we talked, it became apparent that he was struggling with his decision, because he was questioning the strength of his testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He wanted to know why he had not received more clear answers to his prayers and study of the scriptures.\nThis young man, whom I will call Jim, was raised in the mission field in a home with loving parents who were doing their best to teach gospel principles to their children.\nHe is an outstanding athlete and popular among his friends at school. However, he is only one of a very few LDS students in a large high school.\nHaving raised my family in the mission field, I quickly related to Jim\u2019s challenges of wanting to stay true to gospel principles while being accepted by good friends, yet friends whose values and beliefs generally differed from his.\nHe was looking for further confirmation of his testimony of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of the gospel.\nToday I speak to Jim and many others like him\u2014young men and young women across the world who are unsure about their testimonies but very much want to develop strong, vibrant testimonies that will guide them through the shoals of life that lie ahead.\nI also speak to those adults who have not yet felt deeply the spirit of the gospel in their lives. In the absence of a compelling testimony, some have let their daily thoughts and actions become so focused on the things of the world that they have minimized the influence of the light of the gospel in their everyday lives.\nAnd then as Elder Neal A. Maxwell has so eloquently described, also included are those \u201c\u2018honorable\u2019 members who are skimming over the surface instead of deepening their discipleship and who are casually engaged rather than \u2018anxiously engaged\u2019 (D&C 76:75; D&C 58:27)\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1992, 89; or Ensign, Nov. 1992, 65).\nAs I attended the funeral services of Elder Neal A. Maxwell and Elder David B. Haight and listened to their well-deserved tributes, I more fully internalized the extraordinary examples of testimony and discipleship that the lives of these two great brethren demonstrated. I kept pondering how their examples could help strengthen our testimonies and deepen our resolve to come closer to Christ.\nThese two great disciples of Christ exemplify President Gordon B. Hinckley\u2019s admonition to all of us when he said: \u201cI have been quoted as saying, \u2018Do the best you can.\u2019 But I want to emphasize that it be the very best. We are too prone to be satisfied with mediocre performance. We are capable of doing so much better\u201d (\u201cStanding Strong and Immovable,\u201d Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 Jan. 2004, 21).\nSurely President Hinckley\u2019s counsel and encouragement applies as much to the development and strengthening of our testimonies of Jesus Christ as to anything else.\nTrue testimonies bring the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ into our lives and focus all of us toward the same goal of returning to our Father in Heaven\u2014yet our individual testimonies come through varied experiences and at different stages in our lives.\nLike Jim, as a young man I was privileged to have \u201cgoodly parents\u201d (1 Ne. 1:1). They taught gospel principles and values to our family by precept and example. As a young boy I thought I had a testimony. I believed! Then came some personal spiritual experiences through faith, prayer, scripture study, and especially father\u2019s blessings in our home that caused me to think more seriously about the principles I had been taught and believed\u2014but even more deeply about what I was beginning to feel. I will be forever grateful to parents who helped coach me through those precious spiritual experiences. They have had a lasting impact on me and on the strength of my testimony.\nI think Alma must have had us in mind as he was teaching the Zoramites how to gain testimonies of the truth:\n\u201cBut behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words\u201d (Alma 32:27).\nAlma then went on to \u201ccompare the word unto a seed.\u201d He explained that as hearts are opened, \u201cit will begin to swell within your breasts\u201d (Alma 32:28). Alma then gave us the key to developing a successful testimony:\n\u201cBut if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life\u201d (Alma 32:41).\nAnd then the promise!\n\u201cThen, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you\u201d (Alma 32:43).\nThink with me for a moment, brothers and sisters, about what Alma is teaching us.\nFirst, we must have a sincere desire to believe. Phrases such as \u201cawake,\u201d \u201carouse your faculties,\u201d \u201cexperiment,\u201d and \u201cexercise a particle of faith\u201d are action words that suggest sustained effort on our part.\nHis description of the swelling in our breast describes the feeling of the Holy Spirit. And as Moroni promises, \u201cBy the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\u201d (Moro. 10:5).\nTo keep that Spirit growing, Alma says we must nourish it by \u201cfaith with great diligence, and with patience.\u201d He then promises that the rewards of faith, diligence, patience, and long-suffering will bring forth everlasting life (Alma 32:41; see also Alma 32:43).\nLike Alma, latter-day prophets have been clear in their teachings of the things we need to do to develop and strengthen our testimonies.\nWe have been sent here to work out our individual salvation through the tests and challenges of daily life. We cannot do that by relying heavily upon the borrowed light of someone else\u2019s testimony. As we receive inspiration when we hear prophets, leaders, and peers bear their testimonies, those spiritual feelings should further enhance our desire to strengthen our own convictions.\nTo my young friend, and to all wherever you may be, never give up on the Lord. The answer to your prayers may not be as clear or as timely as you would like, but keep praying. The Lord is listening! As you pray, ask for help in understanding the promptings of the Holy Spirit. And then do your very best to be worthy to receive those promptings. As you recognize or feel the impressions and whisperings of the Spirit, then act upon them.\nDaily fervent prayers seeking forgiveness and special help and direction are essential to our lives and the nourishment of our testimonies. When we become hurried, repetitive, casual, or forgetful in our prayers, we tend to lose the closeness of the Spirit, which is so essential in the continual direction we need to successfully manage the challenges of our everyday lives. Family prayer every morning and night adds additional blessings and power to our individual prayers and to our testimonies.\nPersonal, sincere involvement in the scriptures produces faith, hope, and solutions to our daily challenges. Frequently reading, pondering, and applying the lessons of the scriptures, combined with prayer, become an irreplaceable part of gaining and sustaining a strong, vibrant testimony.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball reminded us of the importance of consistent scripture reading when he said, \u201cI find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems \u2026 no divine voice is speaking, \u2026 if I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns\u201d (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 135).\nThe Savior taught, \u201cSearch the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\u201d (John 5:39).\nThe strong, unwavering testimonies that so many of you wonderful, faithful members of the Church embrace have come from prayerfully following counsel from our prophets and the scriptures. That same priceless blessing is available to each of us who earnestly seek it.\nTo my young friend Jim, and all others who may have periodic concerns about the strength of their testimonies, know that you are loved and watched over daily by your Father in Heaven. He will respond as you strive to keep His commandments and reach out for His loving hand.\nWe all share the same promise that the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith: \u201cDraw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\u201d (D&C 88:63).\nOur prophet\u2019s call to do our \u201cvery best\u201d challenges each of us, individually and within our families, to carefully examine our personal lives and then commit to change those things which will more fully assure our testimonies are strong and secure.\nStrong testimonies become the driving force for each of us to do \u201cmuch better.\u201d They become the impenetrable bulwark of armor that protects us from the unrelenting things of the world.\nI bear my witness that we have a loving, caring Father in Heaven and that He and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the boy Joseph to usher in the Restoration of the gospel in this last dispensation.\nJesus Christ heads this Church. President Gordon B. Hinckley is His chosen prophet.\nMay we have the courage and the conviction to follow the prophet\u2019s counsel. As we do so, our personal testimonies will be secure. That this may be so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDonald L. Staheli\nSecuring Our Testimonies\n2004\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear young women friends, tonight I want to be sensitive to your feelings. I pray that you will open your hearts and that the Spirit will teach you as I speak to you about some things that are very important, that need to be talked about at this time. I love you. I have great faith in you. President Benson has taught that \u201cyou have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose. \u2026 Your birth at this particular time was foreordained in the eternities.\u201d (Ensign, Nov. 1986, p. 81.) Even so, we have feelings of great anxiety for your welfare.\nThis is a glorious time to live, to be young, to face an exciting future; but it is also a very threatening and frightening time, if you are not prepared. And if you are prepared, there is no need to fear. (See D&C 38:30.) You are the pioneers of today and will blaze a trail into a wilderness unlike and perhaps even more challenging than that of the pioneers of earlier days. Your courage must be equal to, if not greater than, the courage of young women like Mary Goble Pay. From her journal we read: \u201cWe arrived in Salt Lake City nine o\u2019clock at night the 11th of December 1856. Three out of four that were living were frozen. My mother was dead in the wagon. \u2026\n\u201cEarly next morning Bro. Brigham Young \u2026 came. \u2026 When he saw our condition\u2014our feet frozen and our mother dead\u2014tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\u201cThe doctor amputated my toes. \u2026 The sisters were dressing Mother for [her grave. When my feet were fixed, they carried us in to see our mother for the last time.] That afternoon she was buried. \u2026\n\u201cI [have] thought of [my mother\u2019s] words [before we left England], \u2018Polly, I want to go to Zion while my children are small, so they can be raised in the Gospel of Christ. For I know this is the true Church.\u2019\u201d (In A Believing People, Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert, comp., Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1979, pp. 107, 111.)\nDo mothers today care that much for the gospel and for their children? They do; of course they do. Mothers, it may seem easier for you to die in the wagon than to stand guard every day in defending and upholding standards of righteousness. It may seem easier to die for the gospel in an effort to save your children than to live for it. But live it you must, so that they will not die spiritually.\nAnd young women, it may seem easier for you to have your toes amputated than to be a pioneer today and stand on your feet in front of your peers and dare to be different if their actions violate what the Holy Spirit whispers to you is right.\nWe are warned in the scriptures, \u201cYea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\u201d (2 Tim. 3:12.) Peer pressure is a form of persecution. Peer pressure is one of the great tests of today.\nDo you remember the story of the early pioneers and how the terrible plague of black crickets came down from the mountains to destroy the crops of grain? Men, women, and children prayed and fought those ravaging crickets in a desperate effort to save their crops. The Lord heard their earnest prayers and sent sea gulls. They devoured the crickets. The crops were saved. It was a miracle, they said.\nYoung women, you are the tender crops of today, the promise of tomorrow. President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught us that when we save one young woman, we save generations. Every young woman counts so very, very much.\nIn all soberness I ask you young women, mothers, leaders\u2014all women\u2014to consider the black crickets of our day that are trying to destroy our tender crops, not only our young women and young men, but many adults, also. We have been warned by our prophet that the \u201cforces of evil increase under Lucifer\u2019s leadership and the forces of good increase under the leadership of Jesus Christ.\u201d (Ezra Taft Benson, Ensign, Nov. 1988, p. 87.) The heat of that great confrontation is becoming more intense. Sooner or later, either privately or publicly, we will all be tested. We must be prepared to defend our values, our standards, our commitments, and our covenants to stand as a witness of God at all times, in all things, and in all places.\nThe crickets of our day are different than in times past. They are powerful, more dangerous and less noticeable. Let me explain. At first, things may appear to be very innocent. Thoughts, words, and pictures are placed into our minds through very subtle and sophisticated ways. Thoughts come first and are then expressed through words. No one uses vulgar, crude words without first having the same kind of thoughts. Can you see how damaging such innocent beginnings are? If we are not watchful, the crickets will creep into our safe places, our homes, our hearts, and our minds. Through TV, radio, magazines, movies, literature, music, and fashions, these evil influences will aggressively begin their silent destruction, multiplying their forces as they go.\nTelevision and video programs portray immorality as an exciting and acceptable act of love. Exposure to these messages of deception will dull your senses until what appeared alarming to you at first becomes of little concern and even acceptable. If this happens, that falsehood is unmasked. Your dreams become nightmares, and your hopes, destroyed.\nMusic has a very powerful and wonderful influence in establishing feelings and moods that can lift and elevate your thoughts and your actions. But because it is so powerful, it is cleverly used by the adversary to stimulate your thoughts, feelings, and moods, to pollute and poison your mind and cause you to do things you would not otherwise consider doing.\nYou want to be well-groomed, to look nice, and to be attractive. But you must be alert to the aggressive advertising of immodest fashions. Often the desire and practice of wearing such fashions begins innocently and early. Some mothers dress their little girls in ways that unknowingly train their appetite for the immodest fashions of the world, and when they are teenagers, the pattern is set and it\u2019s so hard to change.\nWhen the counsel of our prophet to avoid dating until sixteen is disregarded, I say that is crickets. Early dating gives Satan a foothold. Single dating at an early age is an invitation for the adversary to attack you while you are away from the safety of the group. Immoral conduct, alcohol, drug abuse, the addicting and degrading effect of pornography, Satan worship and other cult activities are all tools of the adversary carefully designed to enslave you and, ultimately, destroy you. The battle between good and evil is very real. We determine by the choices we make each day where we stand, what our values are, and whom we have chosen to follow.\nMelinda, from Idaho, a young pioneer of our day, wrote about how hard it was for her to have the courage to leave her friends when they were seeing a movie that was popular but clearly against her standards. \u201cSome may think, \u2018It\u2019s just a movie, what\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the little things that turn into big things. It\u2019s not easy to do, but the Lord will help us,\u201d she insisted. And when she left, others followed her. That\u2019s pioneering.\nParents and leaders, I am convinced that most youth will respond when they see no faltering, wavering, or weakening on our part. Mothers, how you live will make so much difference in how your daughters live. Consider carefully your standards and practices because they will follow. How will our youth know which way to go if there is no standard that is clearly set and taught by precept and example?\nI firmly believe that activities and practices, even traditions that do not adhere to gospel standards, can be changed. Young women, you can unite and use positive peer influence to help bring about needed change. There is great power to change when there is unity\u2014in families, in wards and stakes, in neighborhoods and schools\u2014especially when motivated by righteous principles. However, if unacceptable activities are not changed by these efforts, then choose not to participate in them. You can do that. I know you can.\nThe Lord sent sea gulls to help those early Saints. Sea gulls are not the answer for us today. But spirituality is. We live in a world where many voices and influences are attempting to deceive youth and adults. You might honestly wonder, \u201cHow can I know for sure? Some things that are so enticing seem so innocent at first.\u201d\nThere is a sure way to know. Just as the Lord sent the sea gulls to destroy the crickets, He has provided safety and protection for you and me. Spirituality allows us to have the Spirit of the Lord with us, and when we do, we will never be deceived. He promises us, \u201cI will \u2026 be your light in the wilderness \u2026 if \u2026 [you] shall keep my commandments.\u201d (1 Ne. 17:13.) Now listen to this: When you were baptized and then confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you were given the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will help you recognize good and evil, right and wrong, and will teach you and help you remember the lessons you learned even before your earth life. He will strengthen you, comfort you, and give you peace. But there is something important that you must never forget. To have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, you must be clean; and to be clean, you must keep the commandments of God.\nLet me say it another way. When we keep the commandments, we are clean; and when we are clean in our thoughts, our words, and our actions, we can hear the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. In answer to your prayers, you will feel what is right and you will be able to discern between good and evil.\nEvery right choice can conquer a cricket. Rebelling against the laws and the standards that God has given to protect us would be like killing the sea gulls to preserve the crickets.\nStandards of the Church have been given to us to protect us and to help us grow spiritually. When the pioneers ended a day\u2019s journey, each night they checked their wagons for any needed repairs. They united in prayer for continued guidance and protection and took a reading of both distance and direction to see how far they had traveled and make sure they were on the right trail. We would do well to follow the same pattern today. A good measurement to ask concerning every important decision is whether or not this decision will move you toward or away from making and keeping sacred covenants and preparing for the ordinances of the temple.\nWhen you go home this evening and in the days to come, will you think seriously about what it means to be a pioneer today? Talk these things over with your family and friends. Make a firm commitment to be guided by the Spirit concerning what you will do and what you will not do. At nightfall review your actions prayerfully, asking Heavenly Father for strength for you to live righteously so that you will hear and feel the whisperings of the Holy Ghost guiding you. Pray for forgiveness in those areas where you have fallen short and ask for strength to do better. When you do this, Father in Heaven will hear your prayers, and you will feel added strength and will become a powerful influence for good\u2014a real pioneer!\nI encourage you to participate in experiences that are outlined in your Personal Progress book. They are not just to keep you busy, but to build you spiritually. They are not tasks to try your patience or your obedience; they are experiences that will help build your spirituality and your testimony. In your meetings, pray for each other and with each other. There is great power in prayer. Young women, we call upon you to increase your spirituality by living righteously. Raise your standards high, that others might follow. You are the promise of tomorrow, the hope of Israel. \u201cRise in might / With the sword of truth and right; / Sound the war-cry, \u2018Watch and pray!\u2019 / Vanquish ev\u2019ry foe today.\u201d (Hymns, 1985, no. 259.) God bless you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nArdeth G. Kapp\n\u201cCrickets\u201d Can Be Destroyed through Spirituality\n1990\nGeneral Women's Meeting\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, we are assembled as a mighty body of the priesthood, both here in the Conference Center and in locations throughout the world. I am honored yet humbled by the responsibility which is mine to address a few remarks to you. I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to attend me as I do so.\nSeventy-five years ago, on February\u00a014, 1939, in Hamburg, Germany, a public holiday was celebrated. Amid fervent speeches, cheering throngs, and the playing of patriotic anthems, the new battleship Bismarck was put to sea via the River Elbe. This, the most powerful vessel afloat, was a breathtaking spectacle of armor and machinery. Construction required more than 57,000 blueprints for the 380-millimeter, radar-controlled, double-gun turrets. The vessel featured 28,000 miles (45,000 km) of electrical circuits. It weighed over 35,000 tons, and armor plate provided maximum safety. Majestic in appearance, gigantic in size, awesome in firepower, the mighty colossus was considered unsinkable.\nThe Bismarck\u2019s appointment with destiny came more than two years later, when on May\u00a024, 1941, the two most powerful warships in the British Navy, the Prince of Wales and the Hood, engaged in battle the Bismarck and the German cruiser Prinz Eugen. Within five minutes the Bismarck had sent to the depths of the Atlantic the Hood and all but three men of a crew of over 1,400. The other British battleship, the Prince of Wales, had suffered heavy damage and turned away.\nOver the next three days the Bismarck was engaged again and again by British warships and aircraft. In all, the British concentrated the strength of five battleships, two aircraft carriers, 11 cruisers, and 21 destroyers in an effort to find and to sink the mighty Bismarck.\nDuring these battles, shell after shell inflicted only superficial damage on the Bismarck. Was it unsinkable after all? Then a torpedo scored a lucky hit, which jammed the Bismarck\u2019s rudder. Repair efforts proved fruitless. With guns primed and the crews at ready, the Bismarck could only steer a slow circle. Just beyond reach was the powerful German air force. The\u00a0Bismarck could not reach the safety of home port. Neither could provide the needed haven, for the Bismarck had lost the ability to steer a charted course. No rudder, no help, no port. The end drew near. British guns blazed as the German crew scuttled and sank the once seemingly indestructible vessel. The hungry waves of the Atlantic first lapped at the sides and then swallowed the pride of the German navy. The Bismarck was no more.1\nLike the Bismarck, each of us is a miracle of engineering. Our creation, however, was not limited by human genius. Man can devise the most complex machines but cannot give them life or bestow upon them the powers of reason and judgment. These are divine gifts, bestowed only by God.\nLike the vital rudder of a ship, brethren, we have been provided a way to determine the direction we travel. The lighthouse of the Lord beckons to all as we sail the seas of life. Our purpose is to steer an undeviating course toward our desired goal\u2014even the celestial kingdom of God. A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder, never likely to reach home port. To us comes the signal: chart your course, set your sail, position your rudder, and proceed.\nAs with the mighty Bismarck, so it is with man. The thrust of the turbines and the power of the propellers are useless without that sense of direction, that harnessing of the energy, that directing of the power provided by the rudder, hidden from view, relatively small in size but absolutely essential in function.\nOur Father provided the sun, the moon, and the stars\u2014heavenly galaxies to guide mariners who sail the lanes of the sea. To us, as we walk the pathway of life, He provides a clear map and points the way toward our desired destination. He cautions: beware the detours, the pitfalls, the traps. We cannot be deceived by those who would lead us astray, those clever pied pipers of sin beckoning here or there. Instead, we pause to pray; we listen to that still, small voice which speaks to the depths of our souls the Master\u2019s gentle invitation, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d2\nYet there are those who do not hear, who will not obey, who prefer to walk a path of their own making. Too often they succumb to the temptations which surround all of us and which can appear so enticing.\nAs bearers of the priesthood, we have been placed on earth in troubled times. We live in a complex world with currents of conflict everywhere to be found. Political schemes ruin the stability of nations, despots grasp for power, and segments of society seem forever downtrodden, deprived of opportunity and left with a feeling of failure. The sophistries of men ring in our ears, and sin surrounds us.\nOurs is the responsibility to be worthy of all the glorious blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for us. Wherever we go, our priesthood goes with us. Are we standing in holy places? Please, before you put yourself and your priesthood in jeopardy by venturing into places or participating in activities which are not worthy of you or of that priesthood, pause to consider the consequences.\nWe who have been ordained to the priesthood of God can make a difference. When we maintain our personal purity and honor our priesthood, we become righteous examples for others to follow. The Apostle Paul admonished, \u201cBe thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d3 He also wrote that the followers of Christ should be \u201cas lights in the world.\u201d4 Providing an example of righteousness can help to illuminate an increasingly dark world.\nMany of you will remember President N.\u00a0Eldon Tanner, who served as a counselor to four Presidents of the Church. He provided an undeviating example of righteousness throughout his career in industry, during service in the government in Canada, and as an Apostle of Jesus Christ. He gave us this inspired counsel: \u201cNothing will bring greater joy and success than to live according to the teachings of the gospel. Be an example; be an influence for good.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cEvery one of us has been foreordained for some work as [God\u2019s] chosen servant on whom he has seen fit to confer the priesthood and power to act in his name. Always remember that people are looking to you for leadership and you are influencing the lives of individuals either for good or for bad, which influence will be felt for generations to come.\u201d5\nWe are strengthened by the truth that the greatest force in the world today is the power of God as it works through man. To sail safely the seas of mortality, we need the guidance of that Eternal Mariner\u2014even the great Jehovah. We reach out, we reach up to obtain heavenly help.\nA well-known example of one who did not reach upward is that of Cain, son of Adam and Eve. Powerful in potential but weak of will, Cain permitted greed, envy, disobedience, and even murder to jam that personal rudder which would have guided him to safety and exaltation. The downward gaze replaced the upward look; Cain fell.\nIn another time and by a wicked king, a servant of God was tested. Aided by the inspiration of heaven, Daniel interpreted for the king the writing on the wall. Concerning the proffered rewards\u2014even a royal robe, a necklace of gold, and political power\u2014Daniel said, \u201cLet thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another.\u201d6 Great riches and power had been offered to Daniel, rewards representing the things of the world and not of God. Daniel resisted and remained faithful.\nLater, when Daniel worshipped God despite a decree declaring such to be forbidden, he was thrown into a den of lions. The biblical account tells us that the following morning, \u201cDaniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in \u2026 God.\u201d7 In a time of critical need, Daniel\u2019s determination to steer a steady course yielded divine protection and provided a sanctuary of safety. Such protection and safety can be ours as we also steer that steady course toward our eternal home.\nThe clock of history, like the sands of the hourglass, marks the passage of time. A new cast occupies the stage of life. The problems of our day loom ominously before us. Throughout the history of the world, Satan has worked tirelessly for the destruction of the followers of the Savior. If we succumb to his enticings, we\u2014like the mighty Bismarck\u2014will lose that rudder which can guide us to safety. Instead, surrounded by the sophistication of modern living, we look heavenward for that unfailing sense of direction, that we might chart and follow a wise and proper course. Our Heavenly Father will not leave our sincere petition unanswered. As we seek heavenly help, our rudder, unlike that of the Bismarck, will not fail.\nAs we venture forth on our individual voyages, may we sail safely the seas of life. May we have the courage of a Daniel, that we might remain true and faithful despite the sin and temptation which surround us. May our testimonies be as deep and as strong as that of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, who, when confronted by one who sought in every way possible to destroy his faith, declared, \u201cI could not be shaken.\u201d8\nWith the rudder of faith guiding our passage, brethren, we too will find our way safely home\u2014home to God, to dwell with Him eternally. That such may be so for each of us, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, amen.\nBy President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\nGuided Safely Home\n2014\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "I love the gospel of Jesus Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Sometimes we use the terms gospel and Church interchangeably, but they are not the same. They are, however, exquisitely interconnected, and we need both.\nThe gospel is the glorious plan of God in which we, as His children, are given the opportunity to receive all that the Father has (see D&C 84:38). This is called eternal life and is described as \u201cthe greatest of all the gifts of God\u201d (D&C 14:7). A vital part of the plan is our earthly experience\u2014a time to develop faith (see Moroni 7:26), to repent (see Mosiah 3:12), and to reconcile ourselves with God (see Jacob 4:11).\nBecause our mortal frailties and \u201copposition in all things\u201d (2\u00a0Nephi 2:11) would make this life profoundly difficult and because we could not cleanse our own sins, a Savior was needed. When Elohim, the Eternal God and Father of all our spirits, presented His plan of salvation, there was one among us who said, \u201cHere am I, send me\u201d (Abraham 3:27). His name was Jehovah.\nBorn of a Heavenly Father, both spiritually and physically, He possessed the omnipotence to overcome the world. Born of an earthly mother, He was subject to the pain and suffering of mortality. The great Jehovah was also named Jesus and additionally was given the title of Christ, meaning the Messiah or Anointed One. His crowning achievement was the Atonement, wherein Jesus the Christ \u201cdescended below all things\u201d (D&C 88:6), making it possible for Him to pay a redeeming ransom for each of us.\nThe Church was established by Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, \u201cbuilt upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets\u201d (Ephesians 2:20). In this, \u201cthe dispensation of the fulness of times\u201d (D&C 128:18), the Lord restored what once was, specifically telling the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cI will establish a church by your hand\u201d (D&C 31:7). Jesus Christ was and is the head of His Church, represented on earth by prophets holding apostolic authority.\nThis is a magnificent Church. Its organization, effectiveness, and sheer goodness are respected by all who sincerely seek to understand it. The Church has programs for children, youth, men, and women. It has beautiful meetinghouses that number more than 18,000. Majestic temples\u2014now totaling 136\u2014dot the earth, with another 30 under construction or announced. A full-time missionary force of over 56,000, comprised of the young and less so, are serving in 150 countries. The Church\u2019s worldwide humanitarian work is a marvelous display of the generosity of our members. Our welfare system cares for our members and promotes self-reliance in a manner unduplicated anywhere. In this Church we have selfless lay leaders and a community of Saints who are willing to serve one another in a remarkable way. There is nothing like this Church in all the world.\nWhen I was born, our family lived in a tiny cottage on the grounds of one of the great and historic meetinghouses of the Church, the Honolulu Tabernacle. I now apologize to my dear friends in the Presiding Bishopric, who oversee the facilities of the Church, but as a boy I climbed over and under and through every inch of that property, from the bottom of the water-filled reflecting pool to the top of the inside of the imposing lighted steeple. We even swung (Tarzan-like) on the long hanging vines of the huge banyan trees that are on the site.\nThe Church was everything to us. We went to lots of meetings, even more than we have today. We attended Primary on Thursday afternoons. Relief Society meetings were on Tuesday mornings. Mutual for the youth was Wednesday night. Saturday was for ward activities. On Sunday, men and young men would go to priesthood meeting in the morning. Midday we would attend Sunday School. Then in the evening we returned for sacrament meeting. With comings and goings and meetings, it seemed our time was consumed with Church activities all day Sunday and most other days of the week.\nAs much as I loved the Church, it was during those boyhood days that, for the first time, I had a sense there was something even more. When I was five years old, a major conference was held at the tabernacle. We walked down the lane on which we lived and over a small bridge leading to the stately meetinghouse and sat on about the 10th row in the large chapel. Presiding and speaking at the meeting was David\u00a0O. McKay, the President of the Church. I do not recall anything he said, but I vividly remember what I saw and what I felt. President McKay was dressed in a cream-colored suit and, with his wavy white hair, looked very regal. In the tradition of the islands, he wore a triple-thick red carnation lei. As he spoke, I felt something quite intense and very personal. I later understood that I was feeling the influence of the Holy Spirit. We sang the closing hymn.\nWho\u2019s on the Lord\u2019s side? Who?\nNow is the time to show.\nWe ask it fearlessly:\nWho\u2019s on the Lord\u2019s side? Who?\n(\u201cWho\u2019s on the Lord\u2019s Side?\u201d Hymns, no.\u00a0260)\nWith those words being sung by nearly 2,000 people but seeming to be a question posed just to me, I wanted to stand and say, \u201cI am!\u201d\nSome have come to think of activity in the Church as the ultimate goal. Therein lies a danger. It is possible to be active in the Church and less active in the gospel. Let me stress: activity in the Church is a highly desirable goal; however, it is insufficient. Activity in the Church is an outward indication of our spiritual desire. If we attend our meetings, hold and fulfill Church responsibilities, and serve others, it is publicly observed.\nBy contrast, the things of the gospel are usually less visible and more difficult to measure, but they are of greater eternal importance. For example, how much faith do we really have? How repentant are we? How meaningful are the ordinances in our lives? How focused are we on our covenants?\nI repeat: we need the gospel and the Church. In fact, the purpose of the Church is to help us live the gospel. We often wonder: How can someone be fully active in the Church as a youth and then not be when they are older? How can an adult who has regularly attended and served stop coming? How can a person who was disappointed by a leader or another member allow that to end their Church participation? Perhaps the reason is they were not sufficiently converted to the gospel\u2014the things of eternity.\nI suggest three fundamental ways to have the gospel be our foundation:\nDeepen our understanding of Deity. A sustained knowledge of and love for the three members of the Godhead are indispensable. Mindfully pray to the Father, in the name of the Son, and seek direction from the Holy Ghost. Couple prayer with constant study and humble pondering to continually build unshakable faith in Jesus Christ. \u201cFor how knoweth a man the master \u2026 who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?\u201d (Mosiah 5:13).\nFocus on the ordinances and covenants. If there are any of the essential ordinances yet to be performed in your life, intently prepare to receive each of them. Then we need to establish the discipline to live faithful to our covenants, fully using the weekly gift of the sacrament. Many of us are not being regularly changed by its cleansing power because of our lack of reverence for this holy ordinance.\nUnite the gospel with the Church. As we concentrate on the gospel, the Church will become more, not less, of a blessing in our lives. As we come to each meeting prepared to \u201cseek learning, even by study and also by faith\u201d (D&C 88:118), the Holy Spirit will be our teacher. If we come to be entertained, we often will be disappointed. President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball was once asked, \u201cWhat do you do when you find yourself in a boring sacrament meeting?\u201d His response: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been in one\u201d (quoted by Gene\u00a0R. Cook, in Gerry Avant, \u201cLearning Gospel Is Lifetime Pursuit,\u201d Church News, Mar. 24, 1990, 10).\nIn our lives we should desire what occurred after the Lord came to the people of the New World and established His Church. The scriptures read, \u201cAnd it came to pass that thus they [meaning His disciples] did go forth among all the people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land; and they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the people of that generation were blessed\u201d (3\u00a0Nephi 28:23).\nThe Lord wants the members of His Church to be fully converted to His gospel. This is the only sure way to have spiritual safety now and happiness forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Donald\u00a0L. Hallstrom\nConverted to His Gospel through His Church\n2012\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I heard President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball, in a session of conference, ask that God would give him mountains to climb. He said: \u201cThere are great challenges ahead of us, giant opportunities to be met. I welcome that exciting prospect and feel to say to the Lord, humbly, \u2018Give me this mountain,\u2019 give me these challenges.\u201d1\nMy heart was stirred, knowing, as I did, some of the challenges and adversity he had already faced. I felt a desire to be more like him, a valiant servant of God. So one night I prayed for a test to prove my courage. I can remember it vividly. In the evening I knelt in my bedroom with a faith that seemed almost to fill my heart to bursting.\nWithin a day or two my prayer was answered. The hardest trial of my life surprised and humbled me. It provided me a twofold lesson. First, I had clear proof that God heard and answered my prayer of faith. But second, I began a tutorial that still goes on to learn about why I felt with such confidence that night that a great blessing could come from adversity to more than compensate for any cost.\nThe adversity that hit me in that faraway day now seems tiny compared to what has come since\u2014to me and to those I love. Many of you are now passing through physical, mental, and emotional trials that could cause you to cry out as did one great and faithful servant of God I knew well. His nurse heard him exclaim from his bed of pain, \u201cWhen I have tried all my life to be good, why has this happened to me?\u201d\nYou know how the Lord answered that question for the Prophet Joseph Smith in his prison cell:\n\u201cAnd if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\n\u201cThe Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?\n\u201cTherefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.\u201d2\nThere seems to me no better answer to the question of why trials come and what we are to do than the words of the Lord Himself, who passed through trials for us more terrible than we can imagine.\nYou remember His words when He counseled that we should, out of faith in Him, repent:\n\u201cTherefore I command you to repent\u2014repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore\u2014how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.\n\u201cFor behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;\n\u201cBut if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;\n\u201cWhich suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit\u2014and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink\u2014\n\u201cNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\u201d3\nYou and I have faith that the way to rise through and above trials is to believe that there is a \u201cbalm in Gilead\u201d4 and that the Lord has promised, \u201cI will not \u2026 forsake thee.\u201d5 That is what President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught us to help us and those we serve in what seem lonely and overwhelming trials.6\nBut President Monson has also wisely taught that a foundation of faith in the reality of those promises takes time to build. You may have seen the need for that foundation, as I have, at the bedside of someone ready to give up the fight to endure to the end. If the foundation of faith is not embedded in our hearts, the power to endure will crumble.\nMy purpose today is to describe what I know of how we can lay that unshakable foundation. I do it with great humility for two reasons. First, what I say could discourage some who are struggling in the midst of great adversity and feel their foundation of faith is crumbling. And second, I know that ever-greater tests lie before me before the end of life. Therefore, the prescription I offer you has yet to be proven in my own life through enduring to the end.\nAs a young man I worked with a contractor building footings and foundations for new houses. In the summer heat it was hard work to prepare the ground for the form into which we poured the cement for the footing. There were no machines. We used a pick and a shovel. Building lasting foundations for buildings was hard work in those days.\nIt also required patience. After we poured the footing, we waited for it to cure. Much as we wanted to keep the jobs moving, we also waited after the pour of the foundation before we took away the forms.\nAnd even more impressive to a novice builder was what seemed to be a tedious and time-consuming process to put metal bars carefully inside the forms to give the finished foundation strength.\nIn a similar way, the ground must be carefully prepared for our foundation of faith to withstand the storms that will come into every life. That solid basis for a foundation of faith is personal integrity.\nOur choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us creates the solid ground under our faith. It can begin in childhood since every soul is born with the free gift of the Spirit of Christ. With that Spirit we can know when we have done what is right before God and when we have done wrong in His sight.\nThose choices, hundreds in most days, prepare the solid ground on which our edifice of faith is built. The metal framework around which the substance of our faith is poured is the gospel of Jesus Christ, with all its covenants, ordinances, and principles.\nOne of the keys to an enduring faith is to judge correctly the curing time required. That is why I was unwise to pray so soon in my life for higher mountains to climb and greater tests.\nThat curing does not come automatically through the passage of time, but it does take time. Getting older does not do it alone. It is serving God and others persistently with full heart and soul that turns testimony of truth into unbreakable spiritual strength.\nNow, I wish to encourage those who are in the midst of hard trials, who feel their faith may be fading under the onslaught of troubles. Trouble itself can be your way to strengthen and finally gain unshakable faith. Moroni, the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon, told us how that blessing could come to pass. He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it:\n\u201cAnd now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.\n\u201cFor it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.\n\u201cBut because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen.\n\u201cWherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.\u201d7\nThat particle of faith most precious and which you should protect and use to whatever extent you can is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Moroni taught the power of that faith this way: \u201cAnd neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.\u201d8\nI have visited with a woman who received the miracle of sufficient strength to endure unimaginable losses with just the simple capacity to repeat endlessly the words \u201cI know that my Redeemer lives.\u201d9 That faith and those words of testimony were still there in the mist that obscured but did not erase memories of her childhood.\nI was stunned to learn that another woman had forgiven a person who had wronged her for years. I was surprised and asked her why she had chosen to forgive and forget so many years of spiteful abuse.\nShe said quietly, \u201cIt was the hardest thing I have ever done, but I just knew I had to do it. So I did.\u201d Her faith that the Savior would forgive her if she forgave others prepared her with a feeling of peace and hope as she faced death just months after she had forgiven her unrepentant adversary.\nShe asked me, \u201cWhen I get there, how will it be in heaven?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cI know just from what I have seen of your capacity to exercise faith and to forgive that it will be a wonderful homecoming for you.\u201d\nI have another encouragement to those who now wonder if their faith in Jesus Christ will be sufficient for them to endure well to the end. I was blessed to have known others of you who are listening now when you were younger, vibrant, gifted beyond most of those around you, yet you chose to do what the Savior would have done. Out of your abundance you found ways to help and care for those you might have ignored or looked down upon from your place in life.\nWhen hard trials come, the faith to endure them well will be there, built as you may now notice but may have not at the time that you acted on the pure love of Christ, serving and forgiving others as the Savior would have done. You built a foundation of faith from loving as the Savior loved and serving for Him. Your faith in Him led to acts of charity that will bring you hope.\nIt is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith. There is always time. With faith in the Savior, you can repent and plead for forgiveness. There is someone you can forgive. There is someone you can thank. There is someone you can serve and lift. You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel.\nI cannot promise an end to your adversity in this life. I cannot assure you that your trials will seem to you to be only for a moment. One of the characteristics of trials in life is that they seem to make clocks slow down and then appear almost to stop.\nThere are reasons for that. Knowing those reasons may not give much comfort, but it can give you a feeling of patience. Those reasons come from this one fact: in Their perfect love for you, Heavenly Father and the Savior want you fitted to be with Them to live in families forever. Only those washed perfectly clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ can be there.\nMy mother fought cancer for nearly 10 years. Treatments and surgeries and finally confinement to her bed were some of her trials.\nI remember my father saying as he watched her take her last breath, \u201cA little girl has gone home to rest.\u201d\nOne of the speakers at her funeral was President Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball. Among the tributes he paid, I remember one that went something like this: \u201cSome of you may have thought that Mildred suffered so long and so much because of something she had done wrong that required the trials.\u201d He then said, \u201cNo, it was that God just wanted her to be polished a little more.\u201d I remember at the time thinking, \u201cIf a woman that good needed that much polishing, what is ahead for me?\u201d\nIf we have faith in Jesus Christ, the hardest as well as the easiest times in life can be a blessing. In all conditions, we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it. And with prophets revealing to us our place in the plan of salvation, we can live with perfect hope and a feeling of peace. We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord\u2019s service because we never are. We can feel the love of God. The Savior has promised angels on our left and our right to bear us up.10 And He always keeps His word.\nI testify that God the Father lives and that His Beloved Son is our Redeemer. The Holy Ghost has confirmed truth in this conference and will again as you seek it, as you listen, and as you later study the messages of the Lord\u2019s authorized servants, who are here. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson is the Lord\u2019s prophet to the entire world. The Lord watches over you. God the Father lives. His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our Redeemer. His love is unfailing. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring\nMountains to Climb\n2012\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brothers and sisters, in December 2013 the world mourned the death of Nelson Mandela. After 27 years of imprisonment for his role in the antiapartheid struggle, Mandela was the first democratically elected president of South Africa. His forgiveness of those who had imprisoned him was remarkable. He received widespread acclaim and praise.1 Mandela frequently deflected accolades by saying, \u201cI\u2019m no saint\u2014that is, unless you think a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying.\u201d2\nThis statement\u2014\u201ca saint is a sinner who keeps on trying\u201d\u2014should reassure and encourage members of the Church. Although we are referred to as \u201cLatter-day Saints,\u201d we sometimes flinch at this reference. The term Saints is commonly used to designate those who have achieved an elevated state of holiness or even perfection. And we know perfectly well that we are not perfect.\nOur theology does teach us, though, that we may be perfected by repeatedly and iteratively \u201crelying wholly upon\u201d the doctrine of Christ: exercising faith in Him, repenting, partaking of the sacrament to renew the covenants and blessings of baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to a greater degree. As we do so, we become more like Christ and are able to endure to the end, with all that that entails.3 In less formal terms, God cares a lot more about who we are and who we are becoming than about who we once were.4 He cares that we keep on trying.\nThe comedy As You Like It, written by the English playwright William Shakespeare, depicts a dramatic change in a character\u2019s life. An older brother attempts to have his younger brother killed. Even knowing this, the younger brother saves his wicked brother from certain death. When the older brother learns of this undeserved compassion, he is totally and forever changed and has what he calls a \u201cconversion.\u201d Later several women approach the older brother and ask, \u201cWas\u2019t you that did so oft contrive to kill [your brother]?\u201d\nThe older brother answers, \u201c\u2019Twas I; but \u2019tis not I: I do not shame to tell you what I was, since my conversion so sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\u201d5\nFor us, because of God\u2019s mercy and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, such a change is not just literary fiction. Through Ezekiel, the Lord declared:\n\u201cAs for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0If he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0Restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cNone of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right.\u201d6\nIn His mercy, God promises forgiveness when we repent and turn from wickedness\u2014so much so that our sins will not even be mentioned to us. For us, because of the Atonement of Christ and our repentance, we can look at our past deeds and say, \u201c\u2019Twas I; but \u2019tis not I.\u201d No matter how wicked, we can say, \u201cThat\u2019s who I was. But that past wicked self is no longer who I am.\u201d7\nPresident Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught, \u201cOne of God\u2019s greatest gifts to us is the joy of trying again, for no failure ever need be final.\u201d8 Even if we\u2019ve been a conscious, deliberate sinner or have repeatedly faced failure and disappointment, the moment we decide to try again, the Atonement of Christ can help us. And we need to remember that it is not the Holy Ghost that tells us we\u2019re so far gone that we might as well give up.\nGod\u2019s desire that Latter-day Saints keep on trying also extends beyond overcoming sin. Whether we suffer because of troubled relationships, economic challenges, or illnesses or as a consequence of someone else\u2019s sins, the Savior\u2019s infinite Atonement can heal even\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014those who have innocently suffered. He understands perfectly what it is like to suffer innocently as a consequence of another\u2019s transgression. As prophesied, the Savior will \u201cbind up the brokenhearted, \u2026 give \u2026 beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, [and] the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\u201d9 No matter what, with His help, God expects Latter-day Saints to keep on trying.\nJust as God rejoices when we persevere, He is disappointed if we do not recognize that others are trying too. Our dear friend Thoba shared how she learned this lesson from her mother, Julia. Julia and Thoba were among the early black converts in South Africa. After the apartheid regime ended, black and white members of the Church were permitted to attend church together. For many, the equality of interaction between the races was new and challenging. One time, as Julia and Thoba attended church, they felt they were treated less than kindly by some white members. As they left, Thoba complained bitterly to her mother. Julia listened calmly until Thoba had vented her frustration. Then Julia said, \u201cOh, Thoba, the Church is like a big hospital, and we are all sick in our own way. We come to church to be helped.\u201d\nJulia\u2019s comment reflects a valuable insight. We must not only be tolerant while others work on their individual illnesses; we must also be kind, patient, supportive, and understanding. As God encourages us to keep on trying, He expects us to also allow others the space to do the same, at their own pace. The Atonement will come into our lives in even greater measure. We will then recognize that regardless of perceived differences, all of us are in need of the same infinite Atonement.\nSome years ago a wonderful young man named Curtis was called to serve a mission. He was the kind of missionary every mission president prays for. He was focused and worked hard. At one point he was assigned a missionary companion who was immature, socially awkward, and not particularly enthusiastic about getting the work done.\nOne day, while they were riding their bicycles, Curtis looked back and saw that his companion had inexplicably gotten off his bike and was walking. Silently, Curtis expressed his frustration to God; what a chore it was to be saddled with a companion he had to drag around in order to accomplish anything. Moments later, Curtis had a profound impression, as if God were saying to him, \u201cYou know, Curtis, compared to me, the two of you aren\u2019t all that different.\u201d Curtis learned that he needed to be patient with an imperfect companion who nonetheless was trying in his own way.\nMy invitation to all of us is to evaluate our lives, repent, and keep on trying. If we don\u2019t try, we\u2019re just latter-day sinners; if we don\u2019t persevere, we\u2019re latter-day quitters; and if we don\u2019t allow others to try, we\u2019re just latter-day hypocrites.10 As we try, persevere, and help others to do the same, we are true Latter-day Saints. As we change, we will find that God indeed cares a lot more about who we are and about who we are becoming than about who we once were.11\nI am deeply grateful for the Savior, for His infinite Atonement, and for latter-day prophets who encourage us to be Latter-day Saints, to keep on trying.12 I witness of the Savior\u2019s living reality in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Dale\u00a0G. Renlund\nLatter-day Saints Keep on Trying\n2015\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Brothers and sisters, Easter is a time when the Christian world focuses on and rejoices in the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That one moment in time changed everything forever. The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father. In return He asks that we \u201cgo \u2026 and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\n\u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\u201d (Matt. 28:19\u201320).\nA more intimate version of the same message is recorded in the Gospel of John. On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus asked Peter three times, \u201cLovest thou me?\u201d Each time Peter\u2019s reply was the same: \u201cThou knowest that I love thee.\u201d And each time the Savior instructed Peter: \u201cFeed my lambs. \u2026 Feed my sheep. \u2026 Feed my sheep\u201d (John 21:15\u201317).\nThe Savior\u2019s impassioned charge to \u201cfeed [His] sheep\u201d continues in force today. Like Peter and his brethren of old, the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world. This charge is seldom far from our minds. Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary.\nBut the Savior was not just talking to the Apostles. He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church. In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord puts it in very simple terms: \u201cIt becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor\u201d (D&C 88:81).\nDuring the last general conference we challenged our young men to better prepare themselves to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. We asked them to be worthy, qualified, spiritually energized missionaries. With the unsettled conditions that exist in the world today, they need to be \u201cthe greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church.\u201d (See M. Russell Ballard, \u201cThe Greatest Generation of Missionaries,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 2002, 46; Liahona, Nov. 2002, 46.) We don\u2019t expect them to be perfect, but they need to be anxious, willing, and committed to serve so they can reach new levels of spirituality as gospel teachers. They need to know the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and teach it with power in their own words under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit.\nThroughout the Church we are working hard to help all of our missionaries to increase their spiritual maturity. This worldwide effort has been referred to as \u201craising the bar\u201d or \u201craising the standard.\u201d We thank you parents, bishops, and stake presidents for your support in this effort. We also thank the faithful youth of the Church for your willingness to live up to the Lord\u2019s standard. May our Heavenly Father continue to bless you as you prepare to serve Him in this troubled world.\nBut as we raise the level of expectation for the performance of our missionaries, we must also raise the level of expectation for the performance of all of the members of the Church in fulfilling our missionary duties. We need your help, brothers and sisters, to support and assist our missionaries in finding and baptizing many more of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children. We need you to watch over, protect, and inspire the missionaries, who are servants of the Lord. If the standard is to be raised, it is raised for all of us. We must be more faithful. We must be more spiritually in tune. We must prepare ourselves to assist the missionaries in finding those of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children who will embrace the message of the Restoration.\nRemember, brothers and sisters, we\u2019re not marketing a product. We\u2019re not selling anything. We\u2019re not trying to impress anyone with our numbers or our growth. We are members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ, empowered and sent forth by the Lord Himself to find, nourish, and bring safely into His Church those who are seeking to know the truth.\nViewed from that eternal perspective, what we are to do seems so simple and clear, but I know that member missionary work can be challenging and sometimes frightening. Please allow me to suggest three simple things that we can do to assist in this divinely commissioned responsibility.\nFirst, we should exercise our faith and pray individually and as families, asking for help in finding ways to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Ask the Lord to open the way. Prayerfully set a date with your family to have someone in your home for the missionaries to teach. Remember, brothers and sisters, this is the Lord\u2019s Church. Let Him guide you through constant prayer. With a prayer in your heart, talk to everyone you can. Don\u2019t prejudge. Don\u2019t withhold the good news from anyone. Talk to everyone, and trust in the promised power of the Spirit to give you the words you should say. Let them make the decision to accept or reject your invitation. Over time, the Lord will put into your path those who are seeking the truth. He is the Good Shepherd. He knows His sheep, and they will know His voice, spoken through you, and they will follow Him (see John 10).\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley said, \u201cIt will be a great day when our people not only pray for the missionaries throughout the world, but ask the Lord to help them to assist the missionaries who are laboring in their own ward\u201d (\u201cMissionary Service,\u201d First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, Jan. 2003, 19).\nSecond, leaders must lead by example. The Spirit will prompt and guide you in finding those interested in our message. Your personal worthiness will give you the courage and the spiritual power to inspire your members to actively help the missionaries.\nSome years ago a faithful convert, Brother George McLaughlin, was called to preside over a small branch of 20 members in Farmingdale, Maine. He was a humble man, driving a milk delivery truck for a living. Through his fasting and earnest prayer, the Spirit taught him what he and the members of his branch needed to do to help the Church grow in their area. Through his great faith, constant prayer, and powerful example, he taught his members how to share the gospel. It\u2019s a marvelous story, one of the great missionary stories of this dispensation. In just one year, there were 450 convert baptisms in the branch. The next year there were an additional 200 converts. President McLaughlin indicated: \u201cMy job as branch president was to teach [the new converts] how to be Mormons. I had to teach them how to give talks and lessons in church. I had to teach them how to teach the gospel to their children. I trained the new members to become strong members.\u201d Pretty simple.\nJust five years later, the Augusta Maine Stake was organized. Much of the leadership of that new stake came from those converts in the Farmingdale Branch. Now we might ask why there was such great success in those days, and the answer may be because of the urgent need to strengthen the Church. Let me assure you that that same urgency in all units of the Church is every bit as critical today as it was then.\nThe First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have made it clear that missionary work is to be centered in the ward. Stake presidents and bishops have the responsibility and accountability to help members find the pure in heart and prepare them for baptism and for a life of service within their wards and stakes. President Hinckley has also said, \u201cI would like to suggest that every bishop in the Church give as a motto to his people, \u2018Let\u2019s all work to grow the ward\u2019\u201d (\u201cFind the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,\u201d Ensign, May 1999, 106; Liahona, July 1999, 120).\nOne bishop in the state of Washington has prayerfully followed that counsel. This is what he is doing. Through priesthood and auxiliary leaders, the ward council coordinates missionary work in the ward. Missionaries are invited to ward council meetings to discuss their work. Members are assigned to attend investigator visits with the missionaries. Members and missionaries also visit less-active and part-member families together. Last year this ward baptized and confirmed 46 new members, and retention of those members is very high. Those who come into the Church or who return to activity in this ward already have friends because the priesthood and auxiliaries are involved in the conversion process by direction of the bishop through the ward council (see \u201cWard Council Is Secret of Centralia Ward Success,\u201d Church News, 1 Feb. 2003, 5).\nBishops, engage the whole ward in proclaiming the gospel. You will see that the Lord will bless you and your members with many more converts and many more who will return to full activity. Missionary work should not only be on the ward council agendas but also on elders quorum; Relief Society; and other quorum, group, and auxiliary agendas. Emphasis should be placed on baptizing and retaining in activity fathers and mothers along with their children. Thus the missionary work of priesthood and auxiliary leaders should be coordinated by the ward mission leader and the bishop through the ward council. And by doing so, converts will be fully active members in their wards.\nRight now, members have a special opportunity to share the gospel by using the Finding Faith in Christ DVD that was enclosed with your April 2003 Ensign magazine. Invite your neighbors and friends to spend an evening with you during the Easter season, sharing together the life, ministry, and glorious Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. It may also be appropriate to have the missionaries attend with you and teach how the Lord has restored His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThird, member missionary work does not require the development of strategies or gimmicks. It does require faith\u2014real faith and trust in the Lord. It also requires genuine love. The first great commandment is to \u201clove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. \u2026 The second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (Matt. 22:37, 39).\nSo let the power of love guide us in sharing the gospel with family members, friends, neighbors, business associates, and any other people we encounter as we go through life. Most everyone wants to enjoy peace and happiness. That is a natural human desire. People want to find answers to the problems they face. This is increasingly true in the world we now live in.\nProfessional advancement, increased income, bigger homes, or newer cars and recreational equipment do not bring lasting peace and happiness. Happiness comes from understanding God and knowing that He has a plan for our eternal joy and peace. Happiness comes from knowing and loving the Savior and living our lives in accordance with His teachings. Happiness comes from strong family and Church relationships based on gospel values.\nSome members say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid to share the gospel because I might offend someone.\u201d Experience has shown that people are not offended when the sharing is motivated by the spirit of love and concern. How could anyone be offended when we say something like this: \u201cI love the way my church helps me\u201d and then add whatever the Spirit directs. It\u2019s when we appear only to be fulfilling an assignment and we fail to express real interest and love that we offend others. Don\u2019t ever forget, brothers and sisters, that you and I have in our possession the very points of doctrine that will bring people to the Lord. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ has within it the power to bring deep and abiding happiness to the human soul\u2014something that will be valued and cherished for the rest of time and for all eternity. We are not just trying to get people to join our Church; we are sharing with them the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. But as powerful as our message is, it cannot be imposed or forced upon people. It can only be shared\u2014heart to heart, soul to soul, spirit to spirit\u2014by being good neighbors and by caring and showing love. We need to be watchful for one another and reach out to one another. And as we do so, we will radiate the gospel in our own lives, and it will radiate to the people the blessings the gospel has to offer.\nLet us follow the admonition of the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cAfter all that has been said, [our] greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel\u201d (History of the Church, 2:478).\nWe can and we must do better, brothers and sisters. I pray that the Lord will grant to each one of us the faith and courage to increase our participation in supporting our full-time missionaries in sharing the restored gospel with all of God\u2019s children throughout the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nM. Russell Ballard\nThe Essential Role of Member Missionary Work\n2003\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I am grateful for this opportunity, brothers and sisters, to add my witness to those that have been borne so beautifully here.\nThe other night I was somewhat amused as I looked through an evening copy of the Deseret News. I noticed a picture depicting a problem that one of the Baptist churches in the South was having. It seems that their parking lot was being used by an adjoining establishment for commercial use, and the enterprising minister put this sign up at the entrance to the parking lot: \u201cWarning\u2014Violators will be baptized.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help but think of that as I have listened to the real warning of the Lord and the counsel from his servants during these two great days.\nWhen the Lord appeared to the Nephites he said, \u201cAnd again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d (3 Ne. 11:38.) That was his real warning.\nJust twenty-three years ago this fall, I entered Chapman College in Southern California as a student. I came under the wonderful influence of Dr. Guy M. Davis, philosopher, educator, and teacher. Twenty-three years later, just three weeks ago last Friday evening, I saw this magnificent man, with so brilliant a mind, become as a little child, as he entered the waters of baptism and became a member of the Church.\nI thought of another scripture as I witnessed that baptism experience of my friend. The Lord, admonishing his chief apostle Peter, as Luke records it, gave this simple counsel and direction: \u201c\u2026 when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d (Luke 22:32.) I pray the good bishop, the home teacher, the congregation of the ward to which Guy and his family have now been assigned will strengthen my brother.\nPermit a personal experience for just a moment. Strengthening one\u2019s brother, I think, comes closer to home when we think of fellowshiping and friendshiping our family. Some time ago when my youngest daughter was faced with the reality of attending a different school, she looked forward to the new experience with great anticipation and excitement but with the usual anxieties and concerns. Her mom and dad tried to make her experience meaningful, and one that would be positive, and we spent several hours attempting to prepare her mind for the new experience. We even planned a time when we could shop for new clothes and other special school supplies.\nFinally, the long-awaited day arrived. A special evening was planned to help give spiritual comfort and guidance. Later she put her clothes out in anticipation of the next day. As she retired to her bed, seemingly all was well, but about an hour later she appeared at my study door where I was making some preparations.\n\u201cDad,\u201d she said, rubbing her tummy, \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well.\u201d\nYou know the sign; and I thought I understood it, so I invited her in and sat her on my lap. We put on a little music that we liked to listen to together. I rubbed her tummy, and she soon fell asleep. I took her back upstairs, placed her in her bed, tiptoed toward the door; and she broke the silence with the announcement, \u201cI am not asleep yet.\u201d\nI went back and lay down on the bed with her, stroked her head, gave what fatherly counsel one could under the circumstances, and reassured her. Finally she fell asleep. The next morning she appeared at breakfast in her petticoat. She said, \u201cDad, I don\u2019t think I had better go to school today.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cI think I am going to get sick.\u201d\nYou know what she was trying to tell us, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t know how to handle a new situation, Dad. Will I make friends? Will my teacher like me? Will I fit into the social group? Will I be accepted? These are the concerns that all of us experience, as we find ourselves in new and different social situations.\nShe knew what my answer would be and agreed to have me drive her to school. As we got in front of the school building, the warning bell sounded. The tears started to come to her eyes. I got out of the car and assisted her. We walked about ten feet, and she grabbed hold of my leg. It was as though she were a tackle on some football team. And then, as only a child can do to a father, she looked up at me and said philosophically, \u201cDad, if you really love me\u2014if you really love me\u2014don\u2019t send me in there.\u201d\nI said, \u201cHoney, this may be beyond your comprehension, but it\u2019s because I do love you that I am taking you in there.\u201d And I did. When we got inside the door, she grabbed hold of the other leg and held on. Numerous students came and went, and finally the little miracle happened that changed everything.\nFrom I don\u2019t know where came a delightful, wonderful friendshiper, a fellowshiper who knew how to lose herself in serving others; one who would now take the admonishment of the Savior to strengthen her friends. With the exuberance of youth this little girl said, \u201cKellie, how are you?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your home room?\u201d And she told her. \u201cTremendous. I had that home room last year. Come on, and I will take you to it.\u201d\nAnd before Kellie knew it, she had let go of my leg and got about ten paces away, then realized what she had done. I will never forget her expression and the sermon she taught as she looked back. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cDad, you can go now; I don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d\nThank God for the little people as well as the big people who know how to friendship and fellowship.\nThousands of people are coming into this church every month. I pray that we have the genius to follow the counsel of the Lord to strengthen our brethren. I pray that a great bishop and a wonderful home teacher and other members are taking care of my friend, Guy Davis.\nI testify to the divinity of this church. It is true. I sustain President Lee as a prophet, seer, and revelator. I know he is called and ordained of God. I know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, to which I add my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nPaul H. Dunn\n\u201cStrengthen Thy Brethren\u201d\n1972\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "In Minerva Teichert\u2019s magnificent painting Christ in a Red Robe, the Savior of mankind, with nail prints in His hands, stands majestically with outstretched arms. In tenderness and compassion He looks down upon the women straining to reach Him.\nI love the symbolism of women reaching out to touch the Savior. We long to be close to the Lord, for we know that He loves each of us and desires to encircle us \u201ceternally in the arms of his love.\u201d1 His touch can heal ailments spiritual, emotional, or physical. He is our Advocate, Exemplar, Good Shepherd, and Redeemer. Where else would we look, where else would we reach, where else would we come but to Jesus Christ, \u201cthe author and finisher of our faith\u201d?2\nHe pronounced: \u201cYea, verily \u2026, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive.\u201d3 His promise invites us not only to reach towards Him but also to take the all-important next step: to come unto Him.\nThis is such a motivating, cheering doctrine. The Messiah extends His arm of mercy to us, always eager to receive us\u2014if we choose to come to Him. When we do come to the Savior with \u201cfull purpose of heart,\u201d4 we will feel His loving touch in the most personal ways.\nA \u201ccertain woman\u201d5 made that choice and felt His touch. \u201cAnd a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,\n\u201cCame behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.\n\u201cAnd Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\n\u201cAnd Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\n\u201cAnd when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.\n\u201cAnd he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.\u201d6\nI have asked myself what might have happened if this woman with the issue of blood had not believed in the Savior enough to make whatever effort was necessary to touch the border of His robe. In that throng I imagine getting even that close to Him took some doing. Yet, \u201cnothing wavering,\u201d7 she persisted.\nIn like manner, we must demonstrate that faith in the Lord has penetrated our hearts deeply enough to move us to action.\nA friend told me of an instance when she was inconsolable. She felt such sorrow over a family tragedy that on one day she could not even leave her home. Unannounced, a Relief Society sister came to her door and said, \u201cI had the feeling you needed me.\u201d The sister did not probe or ask for details but rather enfolded my friend in her arms and asked, \u201cWould you like to have a prayer?\u201d After their prayer the sister left. That kind touch and sensitive approach did much to heal my friend\u2019s broken heart.\nThis loving Relief Society sister not only listened to the Spirit, but she acted upon that prompting. In a real sense, she showed that the virtue found in the doctrines of salvation had touched her so profoundly that she worked daily to be Christlike. Her actions reflected her personal understanding that \u201ccharity never faileth.\u201d8\nOf the millions of you faithful Relief Society sisters who, like this compassionate sister, reflect that everlasting love of Christ,9 which is charity, President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, \u201cInnumerable are the deeds of these remarkable and wonderful and unselfish women in succoring those in distress, in binding up the wounds of those who have been hurt, in giving cheer and comfort to those in distress, \u2026 in lifting up those who have fallen and giving them strength and encouragement and the will to go forward.\u201d10\nThat very will to go forward toward our Savior sometimes requires on-the-spot repentance. It\u2019s recognizing we\u2019ve made mistakes or haven\u2019t done what we could to encourage or help someone. These personal course corrections in thought, action, or word are essential for all who desire to come unto Christ. They represent individual choices about how we will touch each other literally and figuratively.\nWe draw closer to the Savior as we encircle others in loving arms. Or we don\u2019t. We balm emotional or physical wounds. Or we don\u2019t. We look at each other with a loving rather than a critical eye. Or we don\u2019t. We ask forgiveness for harm we have caused, even if it was unintended. Or we don\u2019t. We do the hard spiritual work of forgiving those who have given us offense. Or we don\u2019t. We quickly correct our errors or oversights in personal relationships when we become aware of them. Or we don\u2019t.\nLike you, I know what it means to make essential course corrections. I remember a time when, without any intent to do so, I offended a sister in my ward. I needed to reconcile this issue, but I must admit that my pride kept me from going to her and asking for her forgiveness. Family, other commitments, on and on\u2014I found ways to postpone my repentance. I was sure things would work out on their own. But they didn\u2019t.\nIn the stillness of not one night but several, I awoke with a clear realization that I was not taking the course the Lord would want me to take. I was not acting on my faith that His arm of mercy was truly extended towards me\u2014if I would act aright. I prayed for strength and courage, humbled myself, and went to the sister\u2019s home and asked for her forgiveness. For us both, it proved to be a sweet, healing experience.\nSometimes a personal course correction is as immediate as retracing our hurried steps toward the exit after Church meetings and instead crossing the foyer to greet a lonely sister who we know will talk long. Often it will be as long-term as regularly rising above feelings of resentment for family members who treat us thoughtlessly\u2014all while we are trying to build positive relationships. Regularly, these individual course corrections, which are crucial instances of repentance, yield \u201cthe peaceable fruit of righteousness.\u201d11\nSeeking that fruit of righteousness, it is no wonder that we, like the women in Minerva Teichert\u2019s glorious artwork, stretch with longing and adoration toward the Savior, for we know He extends \u201cthe arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.\u201d12 Because this glorious promise is true, where else would we look, where else would we reach, where else would we come but to Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, the Lamb of God, our Messiah?\nI know that \u201cthe Son of Righteousness arise[s] with healing in his wings\u201d13 not only for that certain woman with an issue of blood, but also for each one of us. He would guide and bless and gather us\u2014if we will choose to come unto Him. May we do so every day of our lives.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nAnne C. Pingree\nTo Look, Reach, and Come unto Christ\n2006\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "My brothers and sisters and friends, the following statement is sometimes voiced by well-intentioned and sincere individuals: \u201cYou go to your church; I\u2019ll go to mine; but let us walk together.\u201d However, can people really walk together if they don\u2019t agree on the basic teachings of the doctrines of Christ? Do all Christian churches teach the true gospel and its principles and also have the authority to administer the saving ordinances which will guide and exalt their members in God\u2019s heavenly kingdom?\nJesus taught: \u201cEnter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:\n\u201cBecause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\u201d (Matt. 7:13\u201314.)\nDoes that statement by the Savior suggest there are many ways to heaven? Many people do accept man\u2019s philosophy that \u201call roads lead to God,\u201d but it is a philosophy inconsistent with the teachings of our Lord.\nThere is no logic or reason to the proposition that inconsistent teachings and differing doctrines can bring about the same results. If truth comes from one source\u2014God\u2014how can it be so diversely taught?\nWe know that all truth does emanate from God and is therefore unchangeable, consistent, and unified. Consequently, not all Christian churches with their dissimilar teachings can provide a fulness of truth. My intent is to assert with testimony and persuasion of scripture the reasons there can be only one Lord, one acceptable faith, one baptism, and one true church. Then if any of you are convinced you are mistaken in your present beliefs, you should have the courage to investigate and the faith to change and follow the true path Christ has outlined that assures one\u2019s eternal happiness.\nWhen Jesus walked this earth among men, He proclaimed to His disciples: \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d (John 14:6.) He proclaimed that the doctrines He taught were given to Him by his Father. He took no credit Himself\u2014only that He was doing what the Father had given Him to do. \u201cFor the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth.\u201d (John 5:20.)\n\u201cI and my Father are one,\u201d said the Savior. (John 10:30.) This statement does not mean they are one person, but that Jesus and His Father are one in purpose.\nTo hear and accept Jesus is to hear and accept His Father. Their teachings and objectives are identical. The doctrine of salvation is the same for all of God\u2019s progeny. Jesus prayed in His intercessory prayer to His Father concerning those who complied with His doctrines and ordinances: \u201cAnd the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.\u201d (John 17:22; italics added.)\nTo proclaim this doctrine of the Father and the Son, Jesus established His church on the earth. There were then, as there are today, many versions of truth represented by different religious denominations. The Savior didn\u2019t choose any of the churches established by man, either when He ministered on earth or in these latter days. He organized His own church with prophets and apostles, with a gospel plan of salvation and exaltation. It was the church of Jesus Christ.\nJesus recognized that the various sects did not have a fulness of truth and did not possess the authority to administer the ordinances of salvation. When many religious leaders became offended by His teachings, Jesus then proclaimed most of His doctrines by using parables. These made clear to the spiritually attuned person that there was to be only \u201cone fold, and one shepherd.\u201d (John 10:16.)\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\n\u201cBut he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\n\u201cTo him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.\n\u201cAnd when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.\n\u201cAnd a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.\u201d (John 10:1\u20135.)\nWhen this parable was not fully understood, Jesus plainly explained it by saying:\n\u201cI am the door of the sheep. \u2026\n\u201cIf any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. \u2026\n\u201cI am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\n\u201cBut he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth.\u201d (John 10:7, 9, 11\u201312.)\nThe testimony that Jesus is the Good Shepherd was a figure of speech familiar to those accustomed to the pastoral conditions of Palestine. Jesus knew His hearers were acquainted with the prophecy that a shepherd had been promised the children of Israel. David, the shepherd boy who became king, wrote the beautiful Twenty-third Psalm that begins: \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd.\u201d Isaiah prophesied that when God would come down, \u201cHe shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm.\u201d (Isa. 40:11.) There was no mistaking what Jesus meant. He was their Lord\u2014the promised Messiah!\nBy likening false teachers and pastors to thieves and hirelings whose concern was for money rather than the flock, Jesus repudiated all pretenders. A stronger indictment could not be imagined! Then to make His point so clear that no one could misunderstand, He stated: \u201cThere shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\u201d (John 10:16.)\nHe did not recognize then, nor has He recognized since, a multiplicity of folds or shepherds.\nAfter Jesus put his apostles in charge of the Church anciently, they preached the same unity of doctrine and practiced the same ordinances which Jesus had given them. These apostles were not self-appointed servants, for Jesus said to them: \u201cYe have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.\u201d (John 15:16.)\nThey were authorized ministers called to teach and officiate in the saving ordinances of the gospel. Jesus had conferred the priesthood authority on them. As long as they remained on the earth, functioning under the authority Jesus gave them, unity of doctrine and uniformity of the ordinances prevailed. The gospel message, which they were commanded to take to all the world, was the same to everyone everywhere. People were not taught different gospels and then given a choice. There was only one plan for all.\nBecause of the universality of these requirements for salvation, the apostle Paul wrote: \u201cThere is \u2026 one Lord, one faith, one baptism.\u201d (Eph. 4:4\u20135.) On another occasion he wrote: \u201cBut though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\u201d (Gal. 1:8.)\nOne church, one authorized ministry, one orthodox gospel doctrine, and one Holy Ghost characterized the church of Jesus Christ in His time. \u201cFor God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.\u201d (1 Cor. 14:33.) Thus God\u2019s revelation to leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ was reasonable, consistent, and unified.\nIt was only after the death of Christ\u2019s apostles that revelation ceased. The pure doctrines Christ taught became diluted with the philosophy of the world, and profane innovations appeared in the ordinances of the church. Eventually, that which had once been clear and understandable became mythical and confusing. Confusion is the field where Satan operates to deceive and lead mankind astray. Jesus and His apostles predicted a \u201cfalling away\u201d (see 2 Thes. 2:1\u20134), which did occur, and Christianity entered a long night of darkness.\nToday a multiplicity of churches and doctrines abound, all claiming one source. Such a claim, of course, defies reason and contradicts the teachings and pattern established by Jesus Christ. A sincere seeker for truth must ask: \u201cWhich, if any, of the varying Christian groups is right?\u201d For guidance, the apostle James gave this counsel: \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d (James 1:5.) If you sincerely put this promise to the test in seeking light and truth, you will be rewarded.\nMoroni, a Book of Mormon prophet, outlines a simple way to know the authenticity of the gospel of Christ. He exhorted: \u201cAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n\u201cAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\u201d (Moro. 10:4\u20135.)\nSince it is clear that Jesus was one with His Father and that they accepted only one fold, or church, it is essential for every seeker after truth to recognize the hallmarks of the true church. The church of Jesus Christ in any age bears certain identifying characteristics.\nIn the true church of Jesus Christ you will find leaders who can trace their priesthood authority line directly back to the Lord Jesus Christ.\nYou will find in His church the same officers ministering among men: namely, prophets, apostles, bishops, seventies, elders, priests, teachers, and deacons. The Church will be directed on earth by a prophet of God.\nThe major mission of the Church is to \u201cteach [the gospel to] all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d (Matt. 28:19.)\nThe same gifts of the Spirit which prevailed in the church at the time of Jesus are prevalent today. Some of these gifts are: revelation, healing, miracles, prophecy, and many others\u2014as found in First Corinthians, twelfth chapter; Doctrine and Covenants, forty-sixth section; and in the tenth chapter of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Charity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will be in evidence among its membership.\nThe same power which Jesus gave to His apostles that \u201cwhatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\u201d (Matt. 18:18) will also be in the true church today. There are ordinances and blessings bestowed by an authorized ministry to Church members. These covenants and obligations, if entered into and obeyed, apply not just for this life, but for all eternity.\nEvery individual in the Lord\u2019s church is entitled to the sure knowledge, received by personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, that the Church is true. Personal revelation to the individual is the strength of the church of Jesus Christ in any age.\nWe must learn the truth for a surety and not merely suppose we are right. It is our responsibility to know\u2014and by the aid of the scriptures and the Holy Ghost one can know without any doubt.\nOne cannot prayerfully study the scriptures without gaining the knowledge and testimony that there is only one way to exaltation. The scriptures point the way very clearly. It must be God\u2019s way and not man\u2019s way, for God has said: \u201cFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.\u201d (Isa. 55:8.)\nAs an authorized servant and special witness of Jesus Christ in this day, I humbly bear witness that the church of Jesus Christ is on the earth today. This Church bears all of the identifying marks I have mentioned. Presiding under the direction of Jesus Christ stands a living prophet. His name is Spencer W. Kimball, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nWe declare that the church of Jesus Christ has been restored in our time. His original church was lost to the earth by apostasy. Through Joseph Smith, the founding prophet called of God in this modern dispensation, new revelation has come forth from God that has restored the original doctrines and ordinances which belong to the church of Jesus Christ.\nCarrying the message of the Restoration to all nations who permit the restored church entrance, approximately 25,000 missionaries, elders and young women, are called to serve voluntarily, eighteen months for the young women, and two years for the young men.\nOur president, Spencer W. Kimball, has stated that our objective is to bring the gospel to all the world. \u201cWe invite all to heed the message of the Latter-day Saint missionaries. No message you will ever hear will have greater impact for good in your lives, both here in mortality and in the hereafter.\n\u201cThe rewards are priceless for those honest in heart who seek the truth.\u201d (Ensign, May 1976, p. 7.)\nA powerful inducement to investigate the claim of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the consideration of your most precious possession\u2014your family. We give promise to you that when you are obedient to specific ordinances performed in the sacred temples of God, your loved ones may be united together eternally. As you investigate our claim, you will discover how these blessings can come to you.\nWe cannot secure the blessings God has promised without keeping His laws and His commandments. These we must learn and faithfully obey if we are to gain the celestial kingdom.\nI bear my solemn witness to you that there is one true shepherd\u2014our Lord Jesus Christ\u2014one faith, one baptism, and only one church of Christ. I urge all who listen to the voice of the Good Shepherd to investigate the message of His church today and gain a personal witness of its truthfulness. I humbly bear my testimony to the truthfulness of these things and beseech all of you to gain that personal witness, and do so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nDelbert L. Stapley\nWhat Constitutes the True Church\n1977\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I respond to a prompting I have had for a very long time to speak to the youth of the Church who face challenges unknown to us in our youth.\nPresident J. Reuben Clark described our youth as \u201chungry for things of the spirit; they are eager to learn the Gospel, and they want it straight, undiluted.\n\u201cThey want to know about \u2026 our beliefs; they want to gain testimonies of their truth; they are not now doubters but inquirers, seekers after truth. \u2026\n\u201cYou do not have to sneak up behind this spiritually experienced youth and whisper religion in [their] ears; you can come right out, face to face, and talk with [them]. \u2026 You can bring these truths to [them] openly. \u2026 Youth may prove to be not more fearful of them than you are. There is no need for gradual approaches\u201d (\u201cThe Charted Course of the Church in Education\u201d in Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, rev. ed. [1991], 365, 373\u201374).\nI agree with President Clark and will speak plainly to the youth about things I have learned and know to be true.\nWhen I was 18, I was called into military service. I had not received my patriarchal blessing, so the bishop recommended me to a patriarch near the air base.\nPatriarch J. Roland Sandstrom of the Santa Ana California Stake gave me my blessing. In it I was told this: \u201cYou made a free and willing decision to abide by the laws of Eternal Progress as outlined by our elder brother, the Lord Jesus Christ. You \u2026 have been \u2026 given a physical body with which you might experience Earth Life, \u2026 a body of such physical proportions and fitness as to enable your spirit to function through it unhampered by physical impediments. \u2026 Cherish this as a great heritage\u201d (patriarchal blessing of Boyd K. Packer, 15 Jan. 1944, 1).\nThat was a great comfort to me. Because of childhood polio, I was not able to participate in sports and was left with a feeling of inferiority when compared to my friends.\nMy patriarchal blessing counseled: \u201cGuard and protect [your body]\u2014take nothing into it that shall harm the organs thereof because it is sacred. It is the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character\u201d (patriarchal blessing of Boyd K. Packer, 15 Jan. 1944, 1).\nI found in the Word of Wisdom a principle with a promise. The principle: Care for your body; avoid habit-forming stimulants, tea, coffee, tobacco, liquor, and drugs (see D&C 89:3\u20139). Such addictive things do little more than relieve a craving which they caused in the first place.\nThe promise: Those who obey will receive better health (see D&C 89:18) and \u201cgreat treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures\u201d (D&C 89:19).\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith said: \u201cWe came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man. \u2026 All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not\u201d (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 181).\nEven the severe tests of health or a handicapped or disabled body can refine a soul for the glorious day of restoration and healing which surely will come.\nYour body really is the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character.\nPresident Harold B. Lee taught of the important symbolic and actual effect of how we dress and groom our bodies. If you are well groomed and modestly dressed, you invite the companionship of the Spirit of our Father in Heaven and exercise a wholesome influence upon those around you. To be unkempt in your appearance exposes you to influences that are degrading (see The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, ed. Clyde J. Williams [1996], 220).\nAvoid immodest clothing. Dress and groom to show the Lord that you know how precious your body is.\nPresident Hinckley has warned you not to decorate your body with pictures or symbols that will never wash off or to pierce your body with rings or jewelry after the manner of the world (see \u201cYour Greatest Challenge, Mother,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 2000, 97).\nYou would not paint a temple with dark pictures or symbols or graffiti or even initials. Do not do so with your body.\n\u201cKnow ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\n\u201cFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19\u201320).\n\u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n\u201cIf any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are\u201d (1 Cor. 3:16\u201317).\nThere is in your body the supernal power to create life. Boys grow up to be men and may become fathers; girls grow up to be women and may become mothers. Natural and good feelings draw men and women together.\n\u201cAll human beings\u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose\u201d (\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102).\n\u201cMarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and \u2026 the family is central to the Creator\u2019s plan for the eternal destiny of His children\u201d (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102).\nYou should be attracted to one another and to marry. Then, and only then, may you worthily respond to the strong and good and constant desire to express that love through which children will bless your lives. By commandment of God our Father, that must happen only between husband and wife\u2014man and woman\u2014committed to one another in the covenant of marriage (see 1 Cor. 7:2; D&C 42:22). To do otherwise is forbidden and will bring sorrow.\nIt is about controlling these natural desires that the strictest commandments are given in the revelations (see Smith, Teachings, 181; Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:5; Morm. 9:28).\nYoung men and women, keep yourselves worthy. Stay away from those environments, the music, the films, the videos, the clubs, and the associations that draw you into immoral conduct (see 1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Thes. 5:22; 2 Tim. 2:22; D&C 9:13).\nNow, I must speak of another danger, almost unknown in our youth but now everywhere about you.\nNormal desires and attractions emerge in the teenage years; there is the temptation to experiment, to tamper with the sacred power of procreation. These desires can be intensified, even perverted, by pornography, improper music, or the encouragement from unworthy associations. What would have only been a more or less normal passing phase in establishing gender identity can become implanted and leave you confused, even disturbed.\nIf you consent, the adversary can take control of your thoughts and lead you carefully toward a habit and to an addiction, convincing you that immoral, unnatural behavior is a fixed part of your nature.\nWith some few, there is the temptation which seems nearly overpowering for man to be attracted to man or woman to woman. The scriptures plainly condemn those who \u201cdishonour their own bodies between themselves \u2026 ; men with men working that which is unseemly\u201d (Rom. 1:24, 27) or \u201cwomen [who] change the natural use into that which is against nature\u201d (Rom. 1:26).\nThe gates of freedom, and the good or bad beyond, swing open or closed to the password choice. You are free to choose a path that may lead to despair, to disease, even to death (see 2 Ne. 2:26\u201327).\nIf you choose that course, the fountains of life may dry up. You will not experience the combination of love and struggle, the pain and pleasure, the disappointment and sacrifice, that love which, blended together in parenthood, exalts a man or a woman and leads to that fulness of joy spoken of in the scriptures (see 2 Ne. 2:25; 2 Ne. 9:18; D&C 11:13; D&C 42:61; D&C 101:36).\nDo not experiment; do not let anyone of either gender touch your body to awaken passions that can flame beyond control. It begins as an innocent curiosity, Satan influences your thoughts, and it becomes a pattern, a habit, which may imprison you in an addiction, to the sorrow and disappointment of those who love you (see John 8:34; 2 Pet. 2:12\u201314, 18\u201319).\nPressure is put upon legislatures to legalize unnatural conduct. They can never make right that which is forbidden in the laws of God (see Lev. 18:22; 1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Tim. 1:9\u201310).\nSometimes we are asked why we do not recognize this conduct as a diverse and acceptable lifestyle. This we cannot do. We did not make the laws; they were made in heaven \u201cbefore the foundation of the world\u201d (D&C 132:5; D&C 124:41; see also Alma 22:13). We are servants only.\nJust as with the prophets in ancient times, we have been \u201cconsecrated priests and teachers of this people, \u2026 [responsible to] magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence\u201d (Jacob 1:18\u201319).\nWe understand why some feel we reject them. That is not true. We do not reject you, only immoral behavior. We cannot reject you, for you are the sons and daughters of God. We will not reject you, because we love you (see Heb. 12:6\u20139; Rom. 3:19; Hel. 15:3; D&C 95:1).\nYou may even feel that we do not love you. That also is not true. Parents know, and one day you will know, that there are times when parents and we who lead the Church must extend tough love when failing to teach and to warn and to discipline is to destroy.\nWe did not make the rules; they were revealed as commandments. We do not cause nor can we prevent the consequences if you disobey the moral laws (see D&C 101:78). In spite of criticism or opposition, we must teach and we must warn.\nWhen any unworthy desires press into your mind, fight them, resist them, control them (see James 4:6\u20138; 2 Ne. 9:39; Mosiah 3:19). The Apostle Paul taught, \u201cThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it\u201d (1 Cor. 10:13; see also D&C 62:1).\nThat may be a struggle from which you will not be free in this life. If you do not act on temptations, you need feel no guilt. They may be extremely difficult to resist. But that is better than to yield and bring disappointment and unhappiness to you and those who love you.\nSome think that God created them with overpowering, unnatural desires, that they are trapped and not responsible (see James 1:13\u201315). That is not true. It cannot be true. Even if they were to accept it as true, they must remember that He can cure and He can heal (see Alma 7:10\u201313; Alma 15:8).\nNow, what of you who have already made mistakes or have lost yourselves to an immoral lifestyle? What hope do you have? Are you cast off and lost forever?\nThese are not unforgivable sins. However unworthy or unnatural or immoral these transgressions may be, they are not unforgivable (see D&C 42:25). When completely forsaken and fully repented of, there can open the purifying gift of forgiveness, and the burden of guilt will be erased. There is a way back\u2014long, perhaps; hard, certainly; possible, of course! (see Acts 5:31; Eph. 1:7; Mosiah 4:2; Mosiah 26:29; D&C 1:31\u201332; D&C 58:42; D&C 61:2).\nYou need not, you cannot find your way alone. You have a Redeemer. The Lord will lift your burden if you choose to repent and turn from your sins and do them no more. That is what the Atonement of Christ was for.\n\u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool\u201d (Isa. 1:18).\nThe choice rests with you; you are not cast off forever. I repeat, these transgressions are not unforgivable.\nOne may think, It is too late, my life will soon be over, and I am eternally doomed. Not so, for \u201cif in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable\u201d (1 Cor. 15:19).\nJust as the physical body can be cleansed and healed, so can the spirit be washed clean by the power of the Atonement. The Lord will lift you and carry your burden during the suffering and struggle required to make you clean. That is what the Atonement of Christ is all about. He said, \u201cI, the Lord, [will] remember [your sins] no more\u201d (D&C 58:42; see also Heb. 8:12; Heb. 10:17; Alma 36:19).\nOur beloved, precious youth, stay in the Lord\u2019s way. If you stumble, rise up, go on. If you have lost your way, we open our arms and await your return.\nGod be praised for the cleansing, purifying, forgiving power of the Atonement brought by the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom I bear witness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBoyd K. Packer\n\u201cYe Are the Temple of God\u201d\n2000\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "\nElder Wilford G. Edling\nChurch Audit Committee Report\n1974\nFriday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "It has been a year since I was sustained in general conference. I am grateful for this year and for all that I have experienced. I love the Lord and am so very grateful for His sacrifice and for His gospel. I love President Hinckley and sustain him as the Lord\u2019s prophet on the earth. Together with faithful Saints everywhere, I testify of prophets and apostles in our time and pledge my life to His cause.\nA few years ago, I was interviewing missionaries. A winter storm was blowing in as missionaries came and went throughout the day. The storm changed from icy rain to snow and back again. Some missionaries arrived by train from nearby cities and walked to the church through the storm. Others rode their bicycles. Almost without exception they were cheerful and happy. They were the Lord\u2019s missionaries. They had His Spirit and felt joy in His service regardless of their circumstances.\nAs each companionship concluded their interviews, I will never forget watching them go back out into the storm to preach the gospel and do what the Lord had called them to do. I could see their commitment and dedication. I could feel the love they had for the people and for the Lord. As I watched them leave, I felt an overwhelming love for them and for what they were doing.\nLater that night, I attended a priesthood meeting in the same city. The storm had continued and was now mostly snow. During the opening song, the branch president of the smallest and farthest branch and his two missionary counselors, Elder Warner and Elder Karpowitz, came into the chapel. As they got ready to sit down, these two wonderful missionaries took off their winter hats and gloves. They took off their outer coats. Then they each took off a second winter coat and sat down. Like the missionaries earlier in the day, despite the weather these missionaries were happy. They felt the Spirit of the Lord in their lives. Through service in the Lord\u2019s cause, they felt a certain love and warmth and joy that are difficult to describe.\nAs I watched these great young missionaries that evening, I had a remarkable experience. In my mind\u2019s eye, I saw missionaries throughout the mission going out into that winter night. Some were knocking doors and facing rejection as they sought to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some were in homes or apartments teaching individuals and families. In spite of the conditions they faced, they were doing what they could to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who would listen, and they were happy. Into my heart came a feeling that I cannot fully explain.\nBy a wonderful gift of the Spirit, I felt His love, the pure love of Christ that He has for faithful missionaries everywhere, and it changed me forever. I understood how precious each missionary is to Him. I caught a glimpse of what prophets would describe as the \u201cgreatest generation of missionaries\u201d the world has ever known (see M. Russell Ballard, \u201cThe Greatest Generation of Missionaries,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, Nov. 2002, 47). I began to understand why it was necessary to raise the bar so that missionaries everywhere would be entitled to the protection, direction, and happiness that accompany the Spirit of the Lord. I also began to understand why\u2014as parents, bishops, stake presidents, and other leaders\u2014we must do everything we can to help the young people of the Church become worthy of the blessings of missionary service.\nPresident Hinckley described what happens to the heart of every missionary who commits his or her life and work to the Lord when he talked about his own missionary experiences. It was early in his mission, and he was discouraged. The work was hard, and the people were not receptive. However, there came a time when discouragement turned to commitment. For him, the beginning was a letter from his father in which he read: \u201cDear Gordon, I have your letter. \u2026 I have only one suggestion: Forget yourself and go to work.\u201d In describing what happened next, he said: \u201cI got on my knees in that little bedroom \u2026 and made a pledge that I would try to give myself unto the Lord.\n\u201cThe whole world changed. The fog lifted. The sun began to shine in my life. I had a new interest. I saw the beauty of this land. I saw the greatness of the people. \u2026 Everything that has happened to me since that\u2019s been good I can trace to that decision made in that little house\u201d (in Mike Cannon, \u201cMissionary Theme Was Pervasive during Visit of President Hinckley,\u201d Church News, Sept. 9, 1995, 4).\nPresident Hinckley continued by saying: \u201cYou want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause, and bend your efforts to helping people\u201d (in Church News, Sept. 9, 1995, 4).\nTo every young man I would say, do you want to be happy? If so, come and join with us, 52,000 strong and counting, and serve your fellow man as a missionary for the Lord. Make the commitment to give two years of your life to the Lord. It will change everything. You will be happy. The fog will lift. You will come to love the culture and the people you are called to serve. The work will be difficult, but there will also be great satisfaction and joy as you serve. If you are faithful during your mission and thereafter, you will look back on your life and say with President Hinckley, \u201cEverything that has happened to me since that\u2019s been good I can trace to that decision to serve a mission and give my life to the Lord.\u201d\nPresident Hinckley has reminded us that it is not only young elders who are entitled to these blessings. Couples serve wonderfully and are needed so very much. While young sisters are not obligated to serve, the President has said: \u201cWe need some young women. They perform a remarkable work\u201d (\u201cTo the Bishops of the Church,\u201d Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, June 19, 2004, 27). We also know that there are some who, for health or other reasons, are honorably excused from service. We love them and know that our Heavenly Father will provide compensating blessings in their lives as they serve in other ways and live faithfully.\nA year ago, Elder Ballard asked that parents, bishops, and branch presidents work together and help at least one more young man, in addition to those who would normally be prepared to serve, become worthy and be called from each ward and branch of the Church (see \u201cOne More,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, May 2005, 71). Many have responded. As leaders, we should all recommit ourselves to following this inspired request.\nBrothers and sisters, many good bishops have been doing for a long time what Elder Ballard asked. Thirty-six years ago, Bishop Matheson called my home and invited me to his office. Because of world circumstances, the number of missionaries any ward could send was limited, but an additional space had become available, and he had the responsibility to recommend one more missionary. He told me he and his counselors had been praying. He told me that he was impressed that now was the time that the Lord wanted me to serve my mission. I was stunned. Never before had anyone said to me that the Lord had something He wanted me to do. I felt the Spirit of the Lord testify to me that I should go and that I should go now. I said to the bishop, \u201cIf the Lord wants me to serve, then I will go.\u201d\nFor me, everything changed. The fog really did lift, and happiness and joy came into my life. In one way or another, every good thing that has happened to me since that day has come because of the commitment made to serve the Lord and His children and give two years of my life in His service.\nI say again: Come and join with us. Come and be clean. Come and be happy. Come and experience the very thing that the Lord has said is of \u201cmost worth\u201d (D&C 15:6) to you at this time in your life. Come and be part of the greatest generation of missionaries the world has ever known.\nThis is the work of the Lord. Our Father in Heaven lives, and His Son, Jesus Christ, leads and directs this work today. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDavid F. Evans\nYour Mission Will Change Everything\n2006\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, tonight I am going to do something a little unusual. I am going to repeat some elements of a talk which I gave 15 years ago in our general priesthood meeting. I am going to speak of and to the bishops of the Church, this wonderful body of men who are in a very real sense the shepherds of Israel.\nEveryone who participates in this conference is accountable to a bishop or a branch president. Tremendous are the burdens which they carry, and I invite every member of the Church to do all that he or she can to lift the burden under which our bishops and branch presidents labor.\nWe must pray for them. They need help as they carry their heavy loads. We can be more supportive and less dependent upon them. We can assist them in every way possible. We can thank them for all that they do for us. We are wearing them out in a short time by the burdens which we impose upon them.\nWe have more than 18,000 bishops in the Church. Every one is a man who has been called by the spirit of prophecy and revelation and set apart and ordained by the laying on of hands. Every one of them holds the keys of the presidency of his ward. Each is a high priest, the presiding high priest of his ward. Each carries tremendous responsibilities of stewardship. Each stands as a father to his people.\nNone receives money for his service. No ward bishop is compensated by the Church for his work as a bishop.\nThe requirements of a bishop today are as they were in the days of Paul, who wrote to Timothy:\n\u201cA bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;\n\u201cNot given to wine, no striker [that is, not a bully or a violent person], \u2026 not a brawler, not covetous;\n\u201cOne that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;\n\u201c(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)\n\u201cNot a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil\u201d (1 Tim. 3:2\u20136).\nIn his letter to Titus, Paul adds that \u201ca bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; \u2026\n\u201cHolding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers\u201d (Titus 1:7, 9).\nThose words aptly describe a bishop today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nLet me now speak directly to the thousands of bishops who are in attendance tonight. Let me say first that I love you for your integrity and goodness. You must be men of integrity. You must stand as examples to the congregations over which you preside. You must stand on higher ground so that you can lift others. You must be absolutely honest, for you handle the funds of the Lord, the tithes of the people, the offerings that come of their fasting, and the contributions which they make from their own strained resources. How great is your trust as the keepers of the purse of the Lord!\nYour goodness must be as an ensign to your people. Your morals must be impeccable. The wiles of the adversary may be held before you because he knows that if he can destroy you, he can injure an entire ward. You must exercise wisdom in all of your relationships lest someone read into your observed actions some taint of moral sin. You cannot succumb to the temptation to read pornographic literature or even in the secrecy of your own chamber to view pornographic films. Your moral strength must be such that if ever you are called upon to sit in judgment on the questionable morals of others, you may do so without personal compromise or embarrassment.\nYou cannot use your office as bishop to further your own business interests lest through some ensuing financial mishap accusation be placed against you by those who succumbed to your persuasiveness.\nYou cannot compromise your qualifications to sit as a common judge in Israel. It is a fearsome and awesome responsibility to stand as a judge of the people. You must be their judge in some instances as to worthiness to hold membership in the Church, worthiness to enter the house of the Lord, worthiness to be baptized, worthiness to receive the priesthood, worthiness to serve missions, worthiness to teach and to serve as officers in the organizations. You must be the judge of their eligibility in times of distress to receive help from the fast offerings of the people and commodities from the storehouse of the Lord. None for whom you are responsible must go hungry or without clothing or shelter though they be reluctant to ask. You must know something of the circumstances of all of the flock over whom you preside.\nYou must be their counselor, their comforter, their anchor and strength in times of sorrow and trouble. You must be strong with that strength which comes from the Lord. You must be wise with that wisdom which comes from the Lord. Your door must be open to hear their cries and your back strong to carry their burdens, your heart sensitive to judge their needs, your godly love broad enough and strong enough to encompass even the wrongdoer and the critic. You must be a man of patience, willing to listen and striving to understand. You are the only one to whom some can turn. You must be there when every other source has failed. Permit me to read you a few lines from a letter sent to a bishop.\n\u201cDear Bishop:\n\u201cIt has been almost two years since I desperately called you asking for help. At that time I was ready to kill myself. I had no one else to turn to\u2014no money, no job, no friends. My house had been taken, and I had no place to live. The Church was my last hope.\n\u201cAs you know, I had left the Church at the age of 17 and had broken just about every rule and commandment that there was in my search for happiness and fulfillment. Instead of happiness, my life was filled with misery, anguish, and despair. There was no hope or future for me. I even pleaded with God to let me die, to take me out of my misery. Not even He wanted me. I felt that He had rejected me, too.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I turned to you and the Church. \u2026\n\u201cYou listened with understanding, you counseled, you guided, you helped.\n\u201cI began to grow and develop in understanding and knowledge of the gospel. I found that I had to make certain basic changes in my life that were terribly difficult, but that within me I had the worth and strength to do so.\n\u201cI learned that as I lived the gospel and repented, I had no more fear. I was filled with an inner peace. The clouds of anguish and despair were gone. Because of the Atonement, my weaknesses and sins were forgiven through Jesus Christ and His love for me.\n\u201cHe has blessed and strengthened me. He has opened pathways for me, given me direction, and kept me from harm. I have found that as I overcame each obstacle, my business began to grow, enabling my family to benefit and making me feel as though I had accomplished something.\n\u201cBishop, you have given me understanding and support through these past two years. I never would have reached this point if not for your love and patience. Thank you for being what you are as the servant of the Lord to help me, His wandering child.\u201d\nBishops, you stand as watchmen on the tower of the wards over which you preside. There are many teachers in each ward. But you must be the chief teacher among them. You must see that there is no false doctrine creeping in among the people. You must see that they grow in faith and testimony, in integrity and righteousness and a sense of service. You must see that their love for the Lord strengthens and manifests itself in greater love for one another.\nYou must be their confessor, privy to their deepest secrets, holding absolutely inviolate the confidences placed in you. Yours is a privileged communication that must be guarded and respected against all intruders. There may be temptations to tell. You cannot succumb.\nUnless specifically mandated by legal requirement in cases of abuse, what is told to you in confidence must remain with you. The Church maintains a hotline which you should call concerning cases of abuse which may come to you.\nYou as an individual preside over the Aaronic Priesthood of the ward. You are their leader, their teacher, their example, whether you wish to be or not. You are the presiding high priest, the father to the ward family, to be called upon as arbiter in disagreements, as defender of the accused.\nYou preside in meetings where the doctrine is taught. You are accountable for the spiritual nature of those meetings and for the administration of the sacrament to the members, that all may be reminded of sacred covenants and obligations incumbent upon those who have taken upon them the name of the Lord.\nYou must stand as the strong friend of the widow and the orphan, the weak and the beleaguered, the attacked and the helpless.\nThe sound of your trumpet must be certain and unequivocal. In your ward you stand as the head of the army of the Lord, leading them on to victory in the conquest against sin, indifference, and apostasy.\nI know that the work is hard at times. There are never enough hours to get it done. The calls are numerous and frequent. You have other things to do. That is true. You must not rob your employer of the time and energy that are rightfully his. You must not rob your family of time which belongs to them. But as most of you have come to know, as you seek for divine guidance, you are blessed with wisdom beyond your own and strength and capacity you did not know you had. It is possible to budget your time so that you neglect neither your employer, your family, nor your flock.\nGod bless the good bishops of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You may on occasion be inclined to complain about the burdens of your office. But you also know the joys of your service. Heavy as the load may be, you know this is the sweetest, the most rewarding, the most important thing you have ever done outside the walls of your own home.\nI thank the Lord for you. I thank the Lord for good bishops in this Church throughout the world. I pray for you, all 18,000 of you. I plead with you to be strong. I plead with you to be true. I plead with you to be uncompromising in your own lives and in the goals you set for others. Though your days be long and wearisome, may your rest be sweet and in your hearts may you know that peace which comes alone from God to those who serve Him.\nI bear testimony of the strength and goodness of the bishops of this Church. I pay tribute to counselors who help them and to all who serve under their direction in response to the calls they make.\nWe do not expect the impossible from you. We ask that you do the very best you can. Delegate to others every aspect of the work that you legitimately can. And then leave matters in the hands of the Lord.\nSomeday you will be released. It will be a time of sadness for you. But there will be comfort as your people thank you. Nor will they ever forget you. They will remember you and speak with appreciation through years to come, for among all Church officers you are nearest to them. You have been called, ordained, and set apart as shepherds to the flock. You have been endowed with discernment, judgment, and love to bless their lives. In the process, you will bless your own.\nI bear testimony of the divine nature of your calling and of the magnificent way in which you fulfill it. May you, your counselors, your wives, and your children be blessed as you serve the children of the Lord, I humbly pray, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon B. Hinckley\nThe Shepherds of Israel\n2003\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "On a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of 1820, a fourteen-year-old boy knelt in a grove of trees and poured out his thoughts and feelings to God. What followed made his experience the most important event that had transpired in nearly 1,800 years. God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him in person\u2014face to face.\nSubsequently, through this young man, whose name was Joseph Smith, God restored his church and the fulness of his gospel.\nThis restoration is what made that experience so important. I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ that this is true. I know that he talked with God and that there was such a restoration because the Holy Spirit has borne witness of it to me. I say it without the slightest hesitation. I have a sure conviction that it happened.\nIt is important that members of the Church know that each General Authority has that sure knowledge, for the Savior, referring to individual revelation, said to Peter, \u201cAnd upon this rock [meaning the rock of individual revelation] I will build my church.\u201d (Matt. 16:18.)\nServing the Lord is not an individual matter. It is a family affair. Every wife should support her husband in his Church responsibilities; every husband should support his wife in hers; every child his parent; every parent his children; every brother his sister; and every sister her brother.\nThis builds the eternal family.\nI am grateful to my sweetheart, who has been a good companion, an outstanding mother, a dedicated wife, and a remarkable missionary companion. I am grateful to her parents, who have reared a righteous family; to our children, who have joined with us over the years in serving the Lord; to our families, who have been so loyal and supportive; and to my wonderful parents and brother, who, from their heavenly abode, I am confident, are aware of my recent calling to be an especial witness of the Savior.\nMissionary service is rewarding.\nSister Derrick and I spent three satisfying years in northern England in missionary work. We had been home only forty-eight hours when the call came to return as soon as possible and preside over a new mission being established in the Republic of Ireland. What a glorious experience it has been.\nIn Ireland, where social pressures are unusually strong, a father with tears running down his cheeks said, \u201cThey call me a fool\u2014my family calls me a fool\u2014my friends call me a fool; but I\u2019ll take their abuse any and every day of the year in loyalty to my Savior who has led me to the true Church.\u201d\nStill another, who had been particularly skeptical, on the night of his baptism said, \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014but not only is it true, it is the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u201d So declare we to the world regarding this message of the Restoration.\nThe more experience I gain in teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, the more I am impressed with the concept of the Beatitudes shared by a friend years ago which deserves a more broad exposure. Each of the Beatitudes represents a specific step in our orderly progression towards perfection, and teaches us how to qualify ourselves for exaltation, for the Bible concludes the chapter on the Beatitudes with the words, \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (Matt. 5:48.)\nThe Savior began his sermon saying, \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:3; italics added.) When the Savior gave the same sermon to the people of ancient America, he said, \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d (3 Ne. 12:3.) \u201cWho come unto me\u201d\u2014that clarifies the meaning.\nWhen I was a boy, a herd of horses ran wild on Ensign Flats just north of the Utah State Capitol building. In the summertime we would occasionally sit on the mountainside with binoculars and watch the herd as they roamed and grazed on the flat below. For the most part the horses appeared to be a mangy lot, but there was one that had a grace, a dignity, and a spirit that qualified him to lead the herd. We tried on several occasions to put a rope on this stallion. One day we succeeded, but we soon found that we had on the end of the rope a bundle of fury that we couldn\u2019t manage. As hard as we tried, we couldn\u2019t ride him. After several attempts we gave up and turned him loose. He was of no value to us.\nI was reading recently that when professionals train Arabian horses they work with them for several months. At the conclusion of the training period they are placed in a corral without food or water. After several days both food and water are placed some distance away, but within sight. The gate is then opened and the horses run to satisfy their appetites.\nJust before they reach the food and water, the trainer blows a whistle. Those that respond to the trainer\u2019s whistle are singled out as the most valued. They are submissive to the master\u2019s call.\nUnder a mandate from the Lord we have 25,000 young men who are sifting the people of the world to find those that are submissive to Him and to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. We are finding an increasing number throughout the nations of the world who respond, but the vast majority prefer to satisfy their own appetites and to do things their own way instead of the Lord\u2019s way.\nWhen we love the Lord we will submit ourselves to his plan and serve him with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. This is the first step. We must take it in order to qualify for exaltation. The miracle of change begins when we come forth with a contrite spirit.\nThe Savior then said, \u201cBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\u201d (Matt. 5:4; italics added.) This is the second step. It is an essential one. The apostle Paul spoke of a godly sorrow for our sins when he said, \u201cFor godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation.\u201d (2 Cor. 7:10.) It is necessary to repent of our sins if we are to be forgiven and if the atonement of Jesus Christ is to be effective in our lives. Oh! how joyous it is to work with a person as he goes through the process of repentance, enters the water of baptism, and comes into the kingdom of God. There develops a bond of love and unity with those who have gone through this purifying process that the world does not understand.\nThe Savior next said, \u201cBlessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\u201d (Matt. 5:5; italics added.) To be meek is to be teachable. Those who are willing to listen can learn much. Those who are unwilling to listen deny themselves great blessings. You needn\u2019t worry about being deceived, for the prophet Moroni wrote, \u201cBy the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things.\u201d (Moro. 10:5.) You have the receiving set within you to distinguish false doctrine from true doctrine. Follow the steps outlined by the Savior in the Beatitudes and your receiving set will become finely tuned. Then pray to God in sincerity for an answer and your receiving set will work. This is God\u2019s way for us to discern the truth.\nThe Savior further said, \u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\u201d (; italics added.) The Book of Mormon account reads, \u201cFor they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.\u201d (3 Ne. 12:6.) This is important. The Holy Ghost is the great teacher and teaches us the truth of all things. God has documented his plan of salvation\u2014a plan for our salvation. It is found in the holy scriptures and the Lord has commanded us to \u201csearch the scriptures.\u201d (John 5:39.) The plan is not complicated, but it is comprehensive. It is so comprehensive that we never stop learning, yet it is beautifully simple. The Lord has promised us all that if we follow his program we will learn \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept\u201d (D&C 98:12), until the perfect day.\nThis promise is to every man. We should develop an insatiable appetite for knowledge pertaining to our salvation, for the Savior said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d (John 17:3.) There is no more important, exciting, and exhilarating subject than to learn about him who created the worlds and the plan he has prepared for us.\nAs we begin to follow the teachings of the Savior, our thoughts and our hearts turn to others. The Savior continued, \u201cBlessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\u201d (Matt. 5:7; italics added.) Happiness is a by-product of helping others. No man ever finds happiness by thinking of himself. True happiness comes when we lose ourselves in the service of others\u2014when we are merciful to our fellowmen.\nBeing merciful to others leads to purity of heart, for the Savior said, \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d (Matt. 5:8; italics added.)\nThe by-product of a pure heart is inner peace. The Lord next said, \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for theyshall be called the children of God.\u201d (Matt. 5:9; italics added.) When a man obtains inner peace he wants peace in his family. He wants peace in his community. He wants peace in the nation. And he wants peace in the world.\nSister Derrick and I recently drove from Dublin to Limerick, Ireland. Along the way were signs painted on walls and bus stop enclosures: \u201cBrits out\u2014Peace in.\u201d That is not the way nor the road to peace. Peace comes from within the individual. Establish peace in the hearts and minds of the citizens of a country and you\u2019ll have peace in the nation. We declare to the world that living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bring peace to the hearts of men and in turn will bring peace to the nations of the world.\nTeaching the doctrine of the Savior was never done without opposition. The Lord says of those who are willing to withstand social pressures and criticism and continue to serve him: \u201cBlessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\u201cBlessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n\u201cRejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\u201d (Matt. 5:10\u201312; italics added.) And thus the Savior described the miracle of change that comes into one\u2019s life when he accepts the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is a beautiful, miraculous, and soul-satisfying gift from God.\nThe Savior concluded the Beatitudes by saying of those who conform their lives to these teachings, \u201cYe are the salt of the earth. \u2026\n\u201cYe are the light of the world. \u2026\n\u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:13\u201314, 16.)\nThe prophet Nephi, referring to the Savior, said, \u201cHe inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him.\u201d (2 Ne. 26:33.)\nTo all men everywhere we reiterate that invitation to come unto the Savior the way he has outlined, partake of his goodness, \u201cand enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory\u201d (Moses 6:59), \u201cwhich gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God\u201d (D&C 14:7). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRoyden G.

I can\u2019t think of words to express the thoughts that have been in my mind and in my heart since I visited with President Monson on Friday. As I thought about addressing you tonight, I felt so humbled and yet so honored, so privileged to be able to bear my witness of the Savior to the priesthood of the Church throughout the world. What an honor that is.\nI owe the Lord so much because he has blessed me so much. I pray that I can sustain the Brethren in the calls that may be given me, that I might perform in a way that I might partially repay the Lord for those choice blessings. He has seen to it that I have had the blessings that are most important in life. I have had a choice companion with whom I\u2019ve had a special association of love. She has sustained me throughout all of my activities, as I have tried to sustain her. I think right now her mind is as muddled as mine as we try to make the adjustments that will be coming into our lives. I have been blessed with a family of whom I am proud and who are serving the Lord. I don\u2019t know what else you can ask of our Father in Heaven that is of so much worth. I know, too, that they will have to make some changes, as we will not be living as close together as we have been, but I know that they will sustain me in the call and will make the adjustments that are necessary.\nI think of two missionaries who came to my grandfather in the 1920s in Kitchener, Ontario. There were no LDS people in the city. They\u2019d been discouraged, and as they passed his door, they heard a song playing that had been played at their farewell. They approached the door to listen, and he saw them. They introduced the gospel to his heart. He joined the Church, and so all of my life I\u2019ve been blessed to know that the gospel is true and that we have a prophet who guides and directs us.\nI think of the words of the Master to the multitude about the prophetic calling of John the Baptist. He said, \u201cWhat went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? \u2026 A man clothed in soft raiment?\u201d Then he declared that John was a prophet \u201cand more than a prophet,\u201d for \u201call the prophets and the law prophesied until John.\u201d (Matt. 11:7\u201313.)\nOn another occasion he asked the scribes and Pharisees who had been questioning him, \u201cThe baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?\u201d (Mark 11:30.) Of course, the works of John, as of all prophets, were of heaven.\nAs I have read the scriptures, I have watched all of the prophets who have affected my life, and I have seen that they have fulfilled the role that the Master described. I have been privileged to have President Benson in my home as one of us. I have knelt with him as we have called, by prophecy, a stake president. I have felt his divine call as he leads and directs this church through the spirit of revelation. And I bear that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGerald E. Melchin\n\u201cWhat Went Ye Out \u2026 to See?\u201d\n1988\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brothers and sisters and friends, today we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the organization of the Church. The Church of which we speak is not a man-made organization; it is exactly what its name implies.\n\u201cThus [said the Lord himself] shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you all [he continued]: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;\n\u201cAnd that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth\u201d (D&C 115:4\u20136).\nIn the headnote to the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the prophet Joseph wrote: \u201cWe obtained of him [Jesus Christ] the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation; which not only gave us much information, but also pointed out to us the precise day upon which, according to his will and commandment, we should proceed to organize his Church once more here upon the earth\u201d; and then he added, \u201cThe Lord again attests the genuineness of the Book of Mormon.\u201d\nSince the Lord, as he specified the date on which his Church was to be organized, attested again to \u201cthe genuineness of the Book of Mormon\u201d at the same time, in the same revelation, I have concluded that as we observe the sesquicentennial anniversary of the organization of his Church, it will be proper for us to review a few Book of Mormon teachings. There are many reasons why we should do so. To begin with, the Lord has put us under obligation to teach the Book of Mormon. He said that he sent Moroni to reveal it (see D&C 27:5), and that through his mercy he had given the Prophet Joseph \u201cpower \u2026 to translate [it]\u201d (D&C 20:8; see also D&C 1:29), and that it contains \u201cthe truth and the word of God\u201d (D&C 19:26) and \u201cthe fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also\u201d (D&C 20:9).\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith \u201ctold the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book\u201d (History of the Church, 4:461; Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 39).\nNephi tells us that its contents \u201cshall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; \u2026 and the nations who shall possess them [the teachings of the Book of Mormon] shall be judged of them according to the words which are written\u201d (2 Ne. 25:22).\nFor me there could be no more impelling reason for reading the Book of Mormon than this statement that we who have the Book of Mormon shall be judged by what is written in it.\nMoroni says that the very reason the book has been given to us is that we may know the \u201cdecrees of God\u201d (Ether 2:11) set forth therein and by obedience to them escape the calamities which are to follow disobedience.\nTo the early Saints the Lord spoke rather sharply about remembering the Book of Mormon\u2019s teachings.\n\u201cYour minds in times past,\u201d he said to them, \u201chave been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received\u2014\n\u201cWhich vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.\n\u201cAnd this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.\n\u201cAnd they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon\u201d (D&C 84:54\u201357).\nPrior to this he had told them that \u201cthe Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your instruction\u201d (D&C 33:16). On another occasion he had said, \u201cThe elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in \u2026 the Book of Mormon\u201d (D&C 42:12).\nIt is, of course, obvious that unless we read, study, and learn the principles which are in the Book of Mormon, we cannot comply with this direction to teach them.\nThere is another reason why we should read the Book of Mormon: By doing so we will fill and refresh our minds with a constant flow of that \u201cwater\u201d which Jesus said would be in us \u201ca well of water springing up into everlasting life\u201d (John 4:14). We must obtain a continuing supply of this water if we are to resist evil and retain the blessings of being born again.\nThe great overall struggle in the world today is, as it has always been, for the souls of men. Every soul is personally engaged in the struggle, and he makes his fight with what is in his mind. In the final analysis the battleground is, for each individual, within himself. Inevitably he gravitates toward the subjects of his thoughts. Ages ago the wise man thus succinctly stated this great truth: \u201cAs he thinketh in his heart, so is he\u201d (Prov. 23:7).\nIf we would escape the lusts of the flesh and build for ourselves and our children great and noble characters, we must keep in our minds and in their minds true and righteous principles for our thoughts and their thoughts to dwell upon.\nWe must not permit our minds to become surfeited with the interests, things, and practices of the world about us. To do so is tantamount to adopting and going along with them, for the experience of the race sustains the conclusion of him who said that\u2014\nVice is a monster of so frightful mien,\nAs to be hated needs but to be seen;\nYet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\nWe first endure, then pity, and then embrace.\nIf we would avoid adopting the evils of the world, we must pursue a course which will daily feed our minds with and call them back to the things of the Spirit. I know of no better way to do this than by daily reading the Book of Mormon.\nIn all dispensations, the Lord has counseled his people to keep in their minds and thoughts the truths he has revealed to them. To the early Saints of this dispensation he said: \u201cLet the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds\u201d (D&C 43:34). This counsel followed his statement to the elders:\n\u201cYe are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;\n\u201cAnd ye are to be taught from on high\u201d (D&C 43:15\u201316).\nInstructing ancient Israel not to go after \u201cthe gods of the people which [were] round about\u201d them (Deut. 6:14), he said:\n\u201cHear, O Israel. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:\n\u201cAnd thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n\u201cAnd thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\n\u201cAnd thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates\u201d (Deut. 6:4, 6\u20139).\n\u201cSearch the scriptures\u201d (John 5:39), said Jesus to his carping critics, who, being surfeited with the things of this world, rejected him. In the scriptures they could, if they would, learn the truth about him and the things of eternal life which he taught them.\nThe Psalmist thus recounts the rewards which follow knowing and meditating upon the word of God:\n\u201cO how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.\n\u201cThou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies. \u2026\n\u201cI have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.\n\u201cI understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.\n\u201cI have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.\n\u201cI have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.\n\u201cHow sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!\nThrough thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every [evil] way.\n\u201cThy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path\u201d (Ps. 119:97\u2013105).\nI am persuaded, my brothers and sisters, that it is irrational to hope to escape the lusts of the world without substituting for them as the subjects of our thoughts the things of the Spirit, and I know that the things of the Spirit are taught with mighty power in the Book of Mormon. I believe with all my heart, for example, that if our young people could come out of our homes thoroughly acquainted with the life of Nephi, imbued with the spirit of his courage and love of truth, they would choose the right when the choice is placed before them.\nHow marvelous it would be if, when they must make a decision, there would flash into their minds, from long and intimate association with them, the words of Nephi:\n\u201cI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them\u201d (1 Ne. 3:7).\nAnd when the going gets rough and temptation to abandon the course of righteousness presses upon them, they might think of his plea to his wayward brothers:\n\u201cLet us be faithful,\u201d he said, \u201cin keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?\u201d (1 Ne. 4:1; see also 1 Ne. 3:15).\nIf our young folks become familiar with the teachings of the Book of Mormon, they will not only be inspired by the examples of Nephi, the 2,000 sons of Helaman (see Alma 53), and other great Book of Mormon characters to choose the right, they will also be so schooled in the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ that they will be able to know and understand what is right.\nFrom almost every page of the book, there will come to them a moving testimony that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Son of the living God, our Redeemer and Savior. This witness alone will be a sustaining anchor in every storm. In the Book of Mormon they will find the plainest explanation of Christ\u2019s divine mission and his atonement to be found anywhere in sacred scriptures.\nThey will be familiar with the great, fundamental, basic virtues; the Book of Mormon is full of instructions concerning them. They will have learned that \u201cto be carnally-minded is death, and [that] to be spiritually-minded is life eternal\u201d (2 Ne. 9:39). They will know that the Lord God delights in chastity and virtue which are \u201cmost dear and precious above all things\u201d (Moro. 9:9; see also Jacob 2:28). They will know that a violation of these sacred principles is, in the sight of the Lord, \u201can abomination \u2026 above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost\u201d (Alma 39:5).\nThey will have learned the folly of putting their trust in the learning of men or in the riches of this world (see 2 Ne. 9:28\u201330). As a matter of fact, there is no fundamental virtue about which they will not be taught, for in the Book of Mormon, as has already been said, is to be found \u201cthe fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ\u201d (D&C 20:9; see also D&C 19:26).\nAnd so, I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading the Book of Mormon a few minutes each day a lifelong practice. All of us need the uninterrupted association with the Spirit of the Lord. We need to take the Holy Spirit for our constant guide that we be not deceived. I am persuaded by my own experience and that of my loved ones, as well as by the statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that one can get and keep closer to the Lord by reading the Book of Mormon than by reading any other book. Don\u2019t be content with what someone else tells you about what is in it. Drink deeply from the divine fountain itself.\nI feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.\nThat we will seek these blessings through reading the Book of Mormon, I humbly pray and leave my blessings with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarion G. Romney\nThe Book of Mormon\n1980\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "\nVideo Presentation\nI Was a Stranger: Love One Another\n2016\nGeneral Women's Session\n"}, {"text": "What a glorious privilege it has been to celebrate Easter with you on this Sunday of general conference! Nothing could be more fitting than to commemorate the most important event that ever occurred on this earth by worshipping the most important being who ever walked this earth. In this, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we worship Him who commenced His infinite Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was willing to suffer for the sins and weaknesses of each of us, which suffering caused Him \u201cto bleed at every pore.\u201d1 He was crucified on Calvary\u2019s cross2 and rose the third day as the first resurrected being of our Heavenly Father\u2019s children. I love Him and testify that He lives! It is He who leads and guides His Church.\nWithout our Redeemer\u2019s infinite Atonement, not one of us would have hope of ever returning to our Heavenly Father. Without His Resurrection, death would be the end. Our Savior\u2019s Atonement made eternal life a possibility and immortality a reality for all.\nIt is because of His transcendent mission and the peace He grants His followers that my wife, Wendy, and I felt comfort late on January\u00a02, 2018, when we were awakened by a phone call telling us that President Thomas S. Monson had stepped through the veil.\nHow we miss President Monson! We honor his life and his legacy. A spiritual giant, he left an indelible imprint upon all who knew him and upon the Church that he loved.\nOn Sunday, January\u00a014, 2018, in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple, the First Presidency was reorganized in the simple yet sacred pattern established by the Lord. Then, at yesterday morning\u2019s solemn assembly, members of the Church throughout the world raised their hands to confirm the earlier action taken by the Apostles. I am humbly grateful for your sustaining support.\nI am also grateful for those upon whose shoulders I stand. It has been my privilege to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for 34 years and to know personally 10 of the 16 previous Presidents of the Church. I learned much from each of them.\nI also owe much to my forebears. All eight of my great-grandparents were converts to the Church in Europe. Each of these stalwart souls sacrificed everything to come to Zion. During subsequent generations, however, not all my ancestors remained so committed. As a result, I was not raised in a gospel-centered home.\nI adored my parents. They meant the world to me and taught me crucial lessons. I cannot thank them enough for the happy homelife they created for me and my siblings. And yet, even as a boy, I knew I was missing something. One day I jumped on the streetcar and went to an LDS bookstore to find a book about the Church. I loved learning about the gospel.\nAs I came to understand the Word of Wisdom, I wanted my parents to live that law. So, one day when I was very young, I went to our basement and smashed on the concrete floor every bottle of liquor! I expected my father to punish me, but he never said a word.\nAs I matured and began to understand the magnificence of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, I often said to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t want one more Christmas present! I just want to be sealed to my parents.\u201d That longed-for event did not happen until my parents were past 80, and then it did happen. I cannot fully express the joy that I felt that day,3 and each day I feel that joy of their sealing and my being sealed to them.\nIn 1945, while I was in medical school, I married Dantzel White in the Salt Lake Temple. She and I were blessed with nine splendid daughters and one precious son. Today our ever-growing family is one of the greatest joys of my life.\nIn 2005, after nearly 60 years of marriage, my dear Dantzel was unexpectedly called home. For a season, my grief was almost immobilizing. But the message of Easter and the promise of resurrection sustained me.\nThen the Lord brought Wendy Watson to my side. We were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on April\u00a06, 2006. How I love her! She is an extraordinary woman\u2014a great blessing to me, to our family, and to the entire Church.\nEach of these blessings has come as a result of seeking and heeding the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Said President Lorenzo Snow, \u201cThis is the grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint \u2026 that it is our right to have the manifestations of the Spirit every day of our lives.\u201d4\nOne of the things the Spirit has repeatedly impressed upon my mind since my new calling as President of the Church is how willing the Lord is to reveal His mind and will. The privilege of receiving revelation is one of the greatest gifts of God to His children.\nThrough the manifestations of the Holy Ghost, the Lord will assist us in all our righteous pursuits. I remember in an operating room, I have stood over a patient\u2014unsure how to perform an unprecedented procedure\u2014and experienced the Holy Ghost diagramming the technique in my mind.5\nTo strengthen my proposal to Wendy, I said to her, \u201cI know about revelation and how to receive it.\u201d To her credit\u2014and, as I have come to learn, typical of her\u2014she had already sought and received her own revelation about us, which gave her the courage to say yes.\nAs a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, I prayed daily for revelation and gave thanks to the Lord every time He spoke to my heart and mind.\nImagine the miracle of it! Whatever our Church calling, we can pray to our Heavenly Father and receive guidance and direction, be warned about dangers and distractions, and be enabled to accomplish things we simply could not do on our own. If we will truly receive the Holy Ghost and learn to discern and understand His promptings, we will be guided in matters large and small.\nWhen I recently faced the daunting task of choosing two counselors, I wondered how I could possibly choose just two from twelve men whom I love and respect.\nBecause I know that good inspiration is based upon good information, I prayerfully met one-on-one with each Apostle.6 I then sequestered myself in a private room in the temple and sought the Lord\u2019s will. I testify that the Lord instructed me to select President Dallin\u00a0H. Oaks and President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring to serve as my counselors in the First Presidency.\nIn like manner, I testify that the Lord inspired the call of Elder Gerrit W. Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares to be ordained as His Apostles. I and we welcome them to this unique brotherhood of service.\nWhen we convene as a Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, our meeting rooms become rooms of revelation. The Spirit is palpably present. As we wrestle with complex matters, a thrilling process unfolds as each Apostle freely expresses his thoughts and point of view. Though we may differ in our initial perspectives, the love we feel for each other is constant. Our unity helps us to discern the Lord\u2019s will for His Church.\nIn our meetings, the majority never rules! We listen prayerfully to one another and talk with each other until we are united. Then when we have reached complete accord, the unifying influence of the Holy Ghost is spine-tingling! We experience what the Prophet Joseph Smith knew when he taught, \u201cBy union of feeling we obtain power with God.\u201d7 No member of the First Presidency or Quorum of the Twelve would ever leave decisions for the Lord\u2019s Church to his own best judgment!\nBrothers and sisters, how can we become the men and women\u2014the Christlike servants\u2014the Lord needs us to be? How can we find answers to questions that perplex us? If Joseph Smith\u2019s transcendent experience in the Sacred Grove teaches us anything, it is that the heavens are open and that God speaks to His children.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith set a pattern for us to follow in resolving our questions. Drawn to the promise of James that if we lack wisdom we may ask of God,8 the boy Joseph took his question directly to Heavenly Father. He sought personal revelation, and his seeking opened this last dispensation.\nIn like manner, what will your seeking open for you? What wisdom do you lack? What do you feel an urgent need to know or understand? Follow the example of the Prophet Joseph. Find a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort.\nPray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknesses\u2014yes, the very longings of your heart. And then listen! Write the thoughts that come to your mind. Record your feelings and follow through with actions that you are prompted to take. As you repeat this process day after day, month after month, year after year, you will \u201cgrow into the principle of revelation.\u201d9\nDoes God really want to speak to you? Yes! \u201cAs well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course \u2026 as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.\u201d10\nYou don\u2019t have to wonder about what is true.11 You do not have to wonder whom you can safely trust. Through personal revelation, you can receive your own witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, that Joseph Smith is a prophet, and that this is the Lord\u2019s Church. Regardless of what others may say or do, no one can ever take away a witness borne to your heart and mind about what is true.\nI urge you to stretch beyond your current spiritual ability to receive personal revelation, for the Lord has promised that \u201cif thou shalt [seek], thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things\u2014that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.\u201d12\nOh, there is so much more that your Father in Heaven wants you to know. As Elder Neal\u00a0A. Maxwell taught, \u201cTo those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, it is clear that the Father and the Son are giving away the secrets of the universe!\u201d13\nNothing opens the heavens quite like the combination of increased purity, exact obedience, earnest seeking, daily feasting on the words of Christ in the Book of Mormon,14 and regular time committed to temple and family history work.\nTo be sure, there may be times when you feel as though the heavens are closed. But I promise that as you continue to be obedient, expressing gratitude for every blessing the Lord gives you, and as you patiently honor the Lord\u2019s timetable, you will be given the knowledge and understanding you seek. Every blessing the Lord has for you\u2014even miracles\u2014will follow. That is what personal revelation will do for you.\nI am optimistic about the future. It will be filled with opportunities for each of us to progress, contribute, and take the gospel to every corner of the earth. But I am also not naive about the days ahead. We live in a world that is complex and increasingly contentious. The constant availability of social media and a 24-hour news cycle bombard us with relentless messages. If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth, we must learn to receive revelation.\nOur Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works between now and when He comes again. We will see miraculous indications that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, preside over this Church in majesty and glory. But in coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\nMy beloved brothers and sisters, I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation. Let this Easter Sunday be a defining moment in your life. Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly.\nWith Moroni, I exhort you on this Easter Sabbath to \u201ccome unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift,\u201d15 beginning with the gift of the Holy Ghost, which gift can and will change your life.\nWe are followers of Jesus Christ. The most important truth the Holy Ghost will ever witness to you is that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He lives! He is our Advocate with the Father, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. On this Easter Sunday, we commemorate His atoning sacrifice, His literal Resurrection, and His divinity.\nThis is His Church, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I so testify, with my expression of love for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Russell\u00a0M.

Lee approached and greeted us. I mentioned to President Lee that Clark would soon be 12, whereupon President Lee turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat happens to you when you turn 12?\u201d\nThis was one of those times when a father prays that a son will be inspired to give a proper response. Clark, without hesitation, said to President Lee, \u201cI will be ordained a deacon!\u201d\nThe answer was the one for which I had prayed and which President Lee had sought. He then counseled our son, \u201cRemember, it is a great blessing to hold the priesthood.\u201d\nI hope with all my heart and soul that every young man who receives the priesthood will honor that priesthood and be true to the trust which is conveyed when it is conferred. May each of us who holds the priesthood of God know what he believes. As the Apostle Peter admonished, may we ever be ready \u201cto give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.\u201d1 There will be occasions in each of our lives when we will be called upon to explain or to defend our beliefs. When the time for performance arrives, the time for preparation is past.\nMost of you young men will have the opportunity to share your testimonies when you serve as missionaries throughout the world. Prepare now for that wonderful privilege.\nI have experienced many opportunities. One occurred 21 years ago, prior to the time when the German Democratic Republic\u2014or East Germany, as it was more commonly known\u2014was freed from Communist rule. I was visiting with the East German state secretary, Minister Gysi. At that time our temple at Freiberg, in East Germany, was under construction, along with two or three meetinghouses. Minister Gysi and I visited on a number of subjects, including our worldwide building program. He then asked, \u201cWhy is your church so wealthy that you can afford to build buildings in our country and throughout the world? How do you get your money?\u201d\nI answered that the Church is not wealthy but that we follow the ancient biblical principle of tithing, which principle is reemphasized in our modern scripture. I explained also that our Church has no paid ministry and indicated that these were two reasons why we were able to build the buildings then under way, including the beautiful temple at Freiberg.\nMinister Gysi was most impressed with the information I presented, and I was very grateful I was able to answer his questions.\nThe opportunity to declare a truth may come when we least expect it. Let us be prepared.\nOn one occasion, President David O. McKay was asked by a woman not a member of the Church what specific belief set apart the teachings of the Church from those of any other faith. In speaking of this later, President McKay indicated that he had felt impressed to answer, \u201cThat which differentiates the beliefs of my church from those of others is divine authority by direct revelation.\u201d2\nWhere could we find a more significant example of divine authority by direct revelation than in the events which occurred that \u201cbeautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty,\u201d when the lad Joseph Smith retired to the woods to pray. His words describing that moment in history are overpowering: \u201cI saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d3\nOur thoughts turn to the visit of that heavenly messenger, John the Baptist, on May 15, 1829. There on the bank of the Susquehanna River, near Harmony, Pennsylvania, John laid his hands upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and ordained them, saying, \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.\u201d4 The messenger announced that he acted under the direction of Peter, James, and John, who held the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Ordination and baptism followed. This is yet another example of divine authority by direct revelation.\nIn due time, Peter, James, and John were sent to bestow the blessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood. These Apostles sent by the Lord ordained and confirmed Joseph and Oliver to be Apostles and special witnesses of His name. Divine authority by direct revelation characterized this sacred visitation.\nAs a result of these experiences, all of us carry the requirement\u2014even the blessed opportunity and solemn duty\u2014to be true to the trust we have received.\nPresident Brigham Young declared, \u201cThe Priesthood of the Son of God is \u2026 the law by which the worlds are, were, and will continue for ever and ever.\u201d5 President Joseph F. Smith, expanding on this theme, advised, \u201cIt is nothing more nor less than the power of God delegated to man by which man can act in the earth for the salvation of the human family, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and act legitimately; not assuming that authority, nor borrowing it from generations that are dead and gone, but authority that has been given in this day in which we live by ministering angels and spirits from above, direct from the presence of Almighty God.\u201d6\nAs I approached my 18th birthday and prepared to enter military service in World War II, I was recommended to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. Mine was the task to telephone President Paul C. Child, my stake president, for an interview. He was one who loved and understood the holy scriptures, and it was his intent that all others should similarly love and understand them. As I knew from others of his rather detailed and searching interviews, our telephone conversation went something like this:\n\u201cHello, President Child. This is Brother Monson. I have been asked by the bishop to visit with you relative to being ordained an elder.\u201d\n\u201cFine, Brother Monson. When can you see me?\u201d\nKnowing that his sacrament meeting time was 4:00 and desiring minimum exposure of my scriptural knowledge to his review, I suggested, \u201cHow would 3:00 be?\u201d\nHis response: \u201cOh, Brother Monson, that would not provide us sufficient time to peruse the scriptures. Could you please come at 2:00 and bring with you your personally marked set of scriptures?\u201d\nSunday finally arrived, and I visited President Child\u2019s home. I was greeted warmly, and then the interview began. He said, \u201cBrother Monson, you hold the Aaronic Priesthood.\u201d Of course, I knew that. He continued, \u201cHave you ever had an angel minister to you?\u201d\nMy reply, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you are entitled to such?\u201d\nCame my response: \u201cNo.\u201d\nThen he instructed, \u201cBrother Monson, repeat from memory the 13th section of the Doctrine and Covenants.\u201d\nI began, \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels \u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d President Child directed. Then in a calm, kindly tone, he counseled, \u201cBrother Monson, never forget that as a holder of the Aaronic Priesthood you are entitled to the ministering of angels. Now continue the passage.\u201d\nI recited from memory the remainder of the section. President Child said, \u201cSplendid.\u201d He then discussed with me several other sections of the Doctrine and Covenants pertaining to the priesthood. It was a long interview, but I have never forgotten it. At the conclusion, President Child put his arm around my shoulder and said, \u201cYou are now ready to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. Remember that the Lord blesses the person who serves Him.\u201d\nMany years later, Paul C. Child, then of the Priesthood Welfare Committee, and I attended a stake conference together. At the priesthood leadership session, when it was his turn to speak, he took his scriptures in hand and walked from the stand into the congregation. Knowing President Child as I did, I knew what he was going to do. He quoted from the Doctrine and Covenants, including section 18 concerning the worth of a soul, indicating that we should labor all our days to bring souls unto the Lord. He then turned to one elders quorum president and asked, \u201cWhat is the worth of a soul?\u201d\nThe stunned quorum president hesitated as he formulated his reply. I had a prayer in my heart that he would be able to answer the question. He finally responded, \u201cThe worth of a soul is its capacity to become as God.\u201d\nBrother Child closed his scriptures, walked solemnly and quietly up the aisle and back to the stand. As he passed by me, he said, \u201cA most profound reply.\u201d\nWe need to know the oath and covenant of the priesthood because it pertains to all of us. To those who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, it is a declaration of our requirement to be faithful and obedient to the laws of God and to magnify the callings which come to us. To those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood, it is a pronouncement concerning future duty and responsibility, that they may prepare themselves here and now.\nThis oath and covenant is set forth by the Lord in these words:\n\u201cFor whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.\n\u201cThey become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\n\u201cAnd also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;\n\u201cFor he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;\n\u201cAnd he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;\n\u201cAnd he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father\u2019s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.\u201d7\nThe late Elder Delbert L. Stapley of the Quorum of the Twelve once observed: \u201cThere are two main requirements of this oath and covenant. First is faithfulness, which denotes obedience to the laws of God and connotes true observance of all gospel standards. \u2026\n\u201cThe second requirement \u2026 is to magnify one\u2019s calling. To magnify is to honor, to exalt and glorify, and cause to be held in greater esteem or respect. It also means to increase the importance of, to enlarge and make greater.\u201d8\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith was once asked, \u201cBrother Joseph, you frequently urge that we magnify our callings. What does this mean?\u201d He is said to have replied, \u201cTo magnify a calling is to hold it up in dignity and importance, that the light of heaven may shine through one\u2019s performance to the gaze of other men. An elder magnifies his calling when he learns what his duties as an elder are and then performs them.\u201d\nThose who bear the Aaronic Priesthood should be given opportunity to magnify their callings in that priesthood.\nOne Sunday two years ago I was attending sacrament meeting in my ward. That\u2019s a rarity. There were three priests at the sacrament table, with the young man in the center being somewhat handicapped in movement but particularly so in speech. He tried twice to bless the bread but stumbled badly each time, no doubt embarrassed by his inability to give the prayer perfectly. One of the other priests then took over and gave the blessing on the bread.\nDuring the passing of the bread, I thought to myself, \u201cI just can\u2019t let that young man experience failure at the sacrament table.\u201d I had a strong feeling that if I didn\u2019t doubt, he would be able to bless the water effectively. Inasmuch as I was on the stand near the sacrament table, I leaned over and said to the priest closest to me, pointing to the young man who had experienced the difficulty, \u201cLet him bless the water; it\u2019s a shorter prayer.\u201d And then I prayed. I didn\u2019t want a double failure. I love that passage of scripture which tells us that we should not doubt but believe.9\nWhen it was time to bless the water, that young man knelt again and gave the prayer, perhaps somewhat haltingly but without missing a word. I rejoiced silently. While the deacons were passing the trays, I looked over at the boy and gave him a thumbs-up. He gave me a broad smile. When the young men were excused to sit with their families, he sat on the row between his mother and father. What a joy it was to see his mother give him a big smile and a warm hug, while his father congratulated him and put his arm around his shoulder. All three of them looked in my direction, and I gave them all a thumbs-up. I could see the mother and father wiping tears from their eyes. I felt impressed that this young man would do just fine in the future.\nThe priesthood is not really so much a gift as it is a commission to serve, a privilege to lift, and an opportunity to bless the lives of others.\nNot long ago I received a letter concerning a choice young deacon, Isaac Reiter, and the deacons, teachers, and priests who served, lifted, and blessed his life and their own lives.\nIsaac fought cancer from the time he was seven months old until his death at age 13. When he and his family moved to a home near a hospital so that Isaac could receive proper medical attention, the Aaronic Priesthood members in the nearby ward were asked to provide the sacrament to them each Sunday. This weekly ordinance became a favorite of the Aaronic Priesthood holders who participated. Along with their leaders and Isaac\u2019s family, they would gather around Isaac\u2019s hospital bed, sing hymns, and share testimonies. Then the sacrament would be blessed. Isaac always insisted that, as a deacon, he pass the sacrament to his family and to those who had brought it. As he lay in his bed, he gathered the strength to hold a plate of either the blessed bread or water. All present would come to Isaac and partake of the sacrament from the plate. Nurses and other medical staff soon began to participate in the meeting as they realized that Isaac was close to his Heavenly Father and always honored Him. Though weak and in pain, Isaac always held himself with the honor of someone holding a royal priesthood.\nIsaac was a great example to the young men in the ward. They saw his desire to fulfill his duties, even on his deathbed, and they realized that those duties were really privileges. They began showing up earlier in order to prepare the sacrament and to be in their seats on time. There was more reverence.\nIsaac Reiter became a living sermon concerning honoring the priesthood. At his funeral, it was said that throughout his life he had one foot in heaven. No doubt he continues to magnify his duties and assist in the work beyond the veil.\nFor those of us who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, our privilege to magnify our callings is ever present. We are shepherds watching over Israel. The hungry sheep do look up, ready to be fed the bread of life. Are we prepared, brethren, to feed the flock of God? It is imperative that we recognize the worth of a human soul, that we never give up on one of His precious sons.\nShould there be anyone who feels he is too weak to do better because of that greatest of fears, the fear of failure, there is no more comforting assurance to be had than the words of the Lord: \u201cMy grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.\u201d10\nMiracles are everywhere to be found when priesthood callings are magnified. When faith replaces doubt, when selfless service eliminates selfish striving, the power of God brings to pass His purposes. Whom God calls, God qualifies.\nMay our Heavenly Father ever bless, ever inspire, and ever lead all who hold His precious priesthood is my sincere prayer, and I offer it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nOur Sacred Priesthood Trust\n2006\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Many years ago I heard a story that impressed me. I share it with you today as I endeavor for a few minutes to direct your thinking toward the important word peace. A beautiful little blind girl was sitting on the lap of her father in a crowded compartment in a train. A friend seated nearby said to the father, \u201cLet me give you a little rest,\u201d and he reached over and took the little girl on his lap.\nA few moments later the father said to her, \u201cDo you know who is holding you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you do.\u201d\nSome might be inclined to say, \u201cWhat a perfect trust this child had in her father.\u201d Others may say, \u201cWhat a wonderful example of love.\u201d And still others might say, \u201cWhat an example of faith.\u201d To me it indicates a beautiful blending of all of these principles, which brought a priceless inner peace to the child. She knew she was safe because she knew her father knew who was holding her. Affection, respect, and care over the years had placed in this little girl\u2019s heart a peace that surpasseth all understanding. She was at peace because she knew and trusted her father.\nWe plead for peace in our prayers and thoughts. Where is peace? Can we ever enjoy this great gift while wars, rumors of wars, discord, evil, and contention swirl all around us? The answer is yes. Just as the little blind girl sat on the stranger\u2019s lap with perfect contentment because her father knew him, so we can learn to know our Father and find inner peace as we live his principles.\nIt is very significant that when Jesus came forth from the tomb and appeared to his disciples, his first greeting was, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d (Luke 24:36.) Peace\u2014not passion, not personal possessions, not personal accomplishments nor happiness\u2014is one of the greatest blessings a man can receive. Our trust and our relationship with our Heavenly Father should be one similar to that of the little blind girl and her earthly father. When sorrow, tragedy, and heartbreaks occur in our lives, wouldn\u2019t it be comforting if when the whisperings of God say, \u201cDo you know why this has happened to you?\u201d we could have the peace of mind to answer \u201cNo, but you do.\u201d\nCertainly peace is the opposite of fear. Peace is a blessing that comes to those who trust in God. It is established through individual righteousness. True personal peace comes about through eternal vigilance and constant righteous efforts. No man can be at peace who is untrue to his better self. No man can have lasting peace who is living a lie. Peace can never come to the transgressor of the law. Commitment to God\u2019s laws is the basis for peace. Peace is something we earn. It is not a gift. Rather, it is a possession earned by those who love God and work to achieve the blessings of peace. It is not a written document. It is something that must come from within.\nThe Salt Lake Valley was settled by those who trekked over the plains under extremely difficult conditions so they could worship God in peace. Left behind was Nauvoo, a deserted city desecrated by the uninformed, misinformed, embittered enemies of the Church. Peace had flown from the City Beautiful. What a price some of those who have gone before us have paid for the privilege of worshipping in peace.\nNever will peace and hatred be able to abide in the same soul. Permanent peace will elude those individuals or groups whose objective is to condemn, discredit, rail at, or tear down those whose beliefs are different from their own. These people live by hatred and would destroy others insofar as it is in their power to do so. True Christians have no time for contention. Lasting peace cannot be built while we are reviling or hating others. Those who preach hate, ridicule, and untruths cannot be classified as peacemakers. Until they repent they will reap the harvest to which those engaged in the business of hatred are entitled. Feelings of enmity and malice can never be compatible with feelings of peace.\n\u201cThe wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.\n\u201cThere is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\u201d (Isa. 57:20\u201321.)\nHowever, only those at peace can properly cope with accusations and slander. Inner peace is the prized possession of God\u2019s valiant. A testimony of the truthfulness of the teachings of our Savior gives personal peace in times of adversity.\nThere are those who dangle false enticements of peace before us. These are they who are greedy and power hungry. \u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: \u2026 He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.\u201d (Gal. 6:7\u20138.) Inner peace flees from those who sacrifice virtue for sexual promiscuity. There are some who advocate and promote new sexual exploits under the guise of \u201crelief from stress.\u201d These people are only sowing unto the flesh and peddling devilish deeds. Wickedness, no matter how it is labeled or camouflaged, will eventually bring grief and heartache and wipe out inner peace.\nPeace will never be the possession of those who participate in vulgar conversations and behavior. Let us not be planters of poisonous seeds. Rather let us nourish roots of peace in the soil of righteous principles.\nIt was Ralph Waldo Emerson who declared the mighty truth, \u201cNothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but a triumph of principles.\u201d (\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d in Ralph Waldo Emerson: Essays and Lectures, New York: The Library of America, 1983, p. 282.)\nPeace is not a purchase away. Peace is not when the final installment is paid. Peace is not when marriage comes nor when all the children are enrolled in school. Peace is not when the last child returns from the mission field. Peace is not when an inheritance is received. Peace is not when the scars of death start to heal.\nTrue peace must not be dependent upon conditions or happenings. Peace must stem from an inward contentment built upon trust, faith, and goodwill toward God, fellowmen, and self. It must be constantly nurtured by the individual who is soundly anchored to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Only then can a person realize that the trials and tribulations of daily life are less important than God\u2019s total goodness.\nLasting peace is an eternal personal quest. Peace does come from obedience to the law. Peace comes to those who develop character and trust.\nWe have a young grandson who loves gymnastics. He is progressing well and delights in showing us what he can do. While he develops these performance skills his body is maturing in limberness and strength. The last time he invited me to feel the muscles in his arms, I congratulated him. I was proud. As he jumped away from me (gymnasts, it seems, are always jumping and springing), I was impressed with the thought that his parents, grandparents, teachers, and others have an obligation to teach him one of life\u2019s great truths. Flabbiness of character should always be more of a concern than flabbiness of muscles. Body building and body conditioning are worthwhile goals, but there is more needed to gain true inner peace. We must blend balance in our lives and increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (see Luke 2:52) to reach our full potential.\nNo peace will be lasting unless it is built upon the solid foundation of eternal principles such as love of God, love of neighbor, and love of self. Those who love their neighbors can bring peace and happiness to many. Love can build bridges to understanding and tear down walls of suspicion and hate. Christlike love can bring peace into any neighborhood. With that kind of love each of us can help resolve petty differences, be they in the home or community.\nWhile living in another nation just before World War II was to begin, a leading government official had been working hard to maintain peace for his country. He had in his hands a signed document guaranteeing peace. After negotiating in good faith, he seemingly had achieved that for which millions of his countrymen had been hoping and praying. He publicly assured all of us that it was peace for our times.\nSoon, however, he realized that he had been deceived. The men with whom he had negotiated were selfish, greedy, and power hungry. They were only bargaining for time to solidify their position. War came.\nWe learned that peace can never be achieved when we deal with those who deceive and ignore the basic principles taught by our Savior.\nAt such times external events make it even more imperative that we seek peace within ourselves. It is futile to seek it from outward sources.\nIt was George C. Marshall who wisely said, \u201cWe must take the nations of the world as they are, the human passions and prejudices of people as they exist, and find some way to secure \u2026 a peaceful world.\u201d\nPeace must be a triumph of principles. Selfishness and lack of patience seem to block the way. We cry out today with urgency, \u201cHave mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.\u201d (D&C 109:54.) The respected Winston Churchill once said, \u201cThe day will come when \u2026 victorious nations will plan and build in justice and freedom a house of many mansions, where there will be room for all.\u201d\nWe would pray earnestly today that all leaders of nations, large and small, free or oppressed, would know: \u201cAnd above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.\u201d (D&C 88:125.)\nDespite the challenges of curbing federal budget deficits and riots and terrorism, of controlling the arms race and inflation, and of winning an ambitious battle for tax reform, thank God America is at peace. Thank God for those other nations who teach and live in peace. Thank God for worthy men who work to keep it that way. Our responsibility as a nation and its people is to continue to take the lead in furthering peace on earth and goodwill toward all men. (See Luke 2:14.) To all mankind worldwide who would anxiously engage themselves in lasting peace, we share: \u201cBut learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d (D&C 59:23.)\nThe individual, the home, the Church, the school, the government are the fundamental institutions upon which lasting peace depends. The main purpose of schools must always be to develop character, to develop loyalty to the government, loyalty to the home, and loyalty to the individual. This is what real peace is all about\u2014internal and external. No peace, even though temporarily achieved, will be lasting unless it is built upon the solid foundation of such eternal principles as love of God, love of neighbor, love of self. Most men yearn for peace, cry for peace, pray for peace, and work for peace, but there will not be lasting peace until all mankind follow the path pointed out and walked by the living Christ. There can be no peace in sin and disobedience. If I do not have peace within me, others around me will suffer.\nGod has a special love for those of his children who promote and advocate peace. Our responsibility as Church members is to instill in an ever-growing number of people the fact that our personal attitudes and behavior can bring a measure of peace to our troubled world and a sense of stability to anxious times. With peace in our hearts we can know that the trends of the world and the criticisms of men cannot alter the truths of God.\nWhen we properly blend into our lives true principles of love, honesty, respect, character, faith, and patience, peace will become our priceless possession. Peace is a triumph of correct principles.\nJust as the little girl could sit peacefully on the stranger\u2019s lap because her father knew him, so we can find peace if we know our Father and learn to live by his principles.\nNone of us will avoid the storms of life. The winds and the waves will periodically interfere with our chosen course. The laws of the gospel can bring us back on course and guide us to peaceful waters.\nTo this I bear my special witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarvin J. Ashton\nPeace\u2014A Triumph of Principles\n1985\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My brethren and sisters, I bring greetings to you from the Saints in Great Britain and South Africa. It\u2019s exciting to see how the work is moving forward in this area. There are now twenty-seven stakes in Great Britain and one in South Africa. The leadership is generally strong and the work is moving forward and blessing the people.\nAnd now, to have a General Authority from this area! I\u2019m sure the people will be excited. And Brother Cuthbert, I think I can safely assume to bring to you the congratulations and the blessings of the people in your native land. We congratulate you.\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to serve in this area. As I visit the stakes each weekend, I often ask the stake president what his greatest concern is in the stake. So often he replies: \u201cThe lack of commitment by the individual members, the lack of determination to put the work of the Lord first in their lives.\u201d I think of the words of Nephi:\n\u201cAnd I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\n\u201cAnd now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this straight and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\n\u201cWherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.\u201d (2 Ne. 31:15, 19\u201320.)\nHow very important it is to have the light of the Holy Ghost to give us direction. The Holy Ghost functioning through the priesthood can greatly enrich our lives.\n\u201cAnd the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;\n\u201cWhich light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.\u201d (D&C 88:11\u201312.)\nThe Lord said to Frederick G. Williams:\n\u201cWherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\n\u201cAnd if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of immortality, and eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the house of my Father.\u201d (D&C 81:5\u20136.)\nGod gives to each of his children his Spirit to help them keep the commandments and fulfill the purpose of life. But as it is written:\n\u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\u201cBut God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. \u2026\n\u201cNow we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\n\u201cWhich things also we speak, not in the words which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.\u201d (1 Cor. 2:9\u201310, 12\u201313.)\nFrom President Lorenzo Snow we learn the benefits of seeking the Spirit:\n\u201cThere is a way by which persons can keep their consciences clear before God and man, and that is to preserve within them the spirit of God, which is the spirit of revelation to every man and woman. It will reveal to them, even in the simplest of matters, what they shall do, by making suggestions to them. We should try to learn the nature of this spirit, that we may understand its suggestions, and then we will always be able to do right. This is the grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint. We know that it is our right to have the manifestations of the spirit every day of our lives. \u2026 The spirit is in every man and every woman so that they need not walk in the darkness at all, and it is not always necessary for them to come to the President of the Church, or to the Twelve, or to the Elders of Israel, to get counsel; they have it within them. \u2026 From the time we receive the Gospel, go down into the waters of baptism and have hands laid upon us afterwards for the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have a friend, if we do not drive it from us by doing wrong. That friend is the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, which partakes of the things of God and shows them unto us. This is a grand means that the Lord has provided for us, that we may know the light, and not be groveling continually in the dark.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1899, p. 52.)\nThe apostle Paul admonished us about grieving the Holy Spirit lest we lose it. He said:\n\u201cGrieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.\n\u201cLet all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:\n\u201cAnd be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ\u2019s sake hath forgiven you.\u201d (Eph. 4:30\u201332.)\nPresident Harold B. Lee has said:\n\u201cI have learned something of what the Spirit has taught, and I know now that the place of safety in this world is not in any given place; it doesn\u2019t make so much difference where we live; but the all-important thing is how we live, and I have found that security can come to Israel only when they keep the commandments, when they live so that they can enjoy the companionship, the direction, the comfort and the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, when they are willing to listen to these men whom God has set here to preside as His mouthpieces, and when we obey the counsels of the Church.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1943, p. 129.)\nThe lifeblood of the Church is the Holy Ghost functioning through the holy priesthood. The Church is guided in every move by revelation. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery:\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge of whatsoever thing you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive.\n\u201cYea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.\n\u201cNow, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.\u201d (D&C 8:1\u20133.)\nThis is the way direction comes to the President of the Church.\nThis is the same spirit that gives direction to the stake president, to the bishop of the ward and the individual members of the Church.\nI like the verse of one of our hymns:\nThy Spirit, Lord, has stirred our souls,\nAnd by its inward shining glow\nWe see anew our sacred goals\nAnd feel thy nearness here below.\nNo burning bush near Sinai\nCould show thy presence, Lord, more nigh.\n\u201cDid not our hearts within us burn?\u201d\nWe know the Spirit\u2019s fire is here.\nIt makes our souls for service yearn;\nIt makes the path of duty clear.\nLord, may it prompt us, day by day,\nIn all we do, in all we say.\nMay I leave with you my witness, my brothers and sisters, of the truth of this great work, which I have received in this same manner, through the Holy Ghost as it has witnessed unto me. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJames A. Cullimore\nGrieve Not the Holy Spirit, Lest We Lose It\n1978\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brethren, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening. I address my remarks to the young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood and to the bishops and counselors who preside over them. I will speak about the sacred activities of Aaronic Priesthood holders in preparing, administering, and passing the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper to the members of the Church.\nI.\nOn May 15, 1829, John the Baptist restored the Aaronic Priesthood to the earth. He did so by laying his hands upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and speaking these words: \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness\u201d (D&C 13:1).\nLater, the Lord revealed these further truths: \u201cThe lesser priesthood \u2026 holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel;\n\u201cWhich gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins\u201d (D&C 84:26\u201327).\nWhat does it mean that the Aaronic Priesthood holds \u201cthe key of the ministering of angels\u201d and of the \u201cgospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins\u201d? The meaning is found in the ordinance of baptism and in the sacrament. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the sacrament is a renewal of the covenants and blessings of baptism. Both should be preceded by repentance. When we keep the covenants made in these ordinances, we are promised that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. The ministering of angels is one of the manifestations of that Spirit.\nII.\nWe begin with the doctrine as taught by the Lord. During His ministry, Jesus taught that baptism is necessary for salvation. \u201cExcept a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\u201d (John 3:5). Baptism is the first of the saving ordinances. When we are baptized, we covenant that we will take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and serve Him and keep His commandments.\nAt the conclusion of His ministry, Jesus introduced the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper. He broke bread and blessed it and gave it to His disciples, saying, \u201cTake, eat; this is my body\u201d (Matt. 26:26). \u201cThis do in remembrance of me\u201d (Luke 22:19). He took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins\u201d (Matt. 26:28).\nWhen He introduced the sacrament, the Savior also gave teachings and promises about the Holy Ghost. On that sacred occasion known as the Last Supper, Jesus explained the mission of the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. The Comforter would testify of Him and reveal other truths. Jesus also explained that He had to leave His disciples in order for the Comforter to come to them. When I depart, He told them, \u201cI will send him unto you\u201d (John 16:7). After His Resurrection, He told His Apostles to tarry in Jerusalem until they were given \u201cpower from on high\u201d (Luke 24:49). That power came when \u201cthe promise of the Holy Ghost\u201d was \u201cshed forth\u201d upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (see Acts 2:33).\nSimilarly, when the Savior introduced the sacrament in the New World, He promised, \u201cHe that eateth this bread eateth of my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled\u201d (3 Ne. 20:8). The meaning of that promise is evident: \u201cNow, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they were filled with the Spirit\u201d (3 Ne. 20:9).\nThe close relationship between partaking of the sacrament and the companionship of the Holy Ghost is explained in the revealed prayer on the sacrament. In partaking of the bread, we witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His commandments. When we do so, we have the promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us (see D&C 20:77).\nTo have the continuous companionship of the Holy Ghost is the most precious possession we can have in mortality. The gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon us by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood after our baptism. But to realize the blessings of that gift, we must keep ourselves free from sin. When we commit sin, we become unclean and the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from us. The Spirit of the Lord does not dwell in \u201cunholy temples\u201d (see Mosiah 2:36\u201337; Alma 34:35\u201336; Hel. 4:24), and no unclean thing can dwell in His presence (see Eph. 5:5; 1 Ne. 10:21; Alma 7:21; Moses 6:57).\nA few weeks ago I used a chain saw to cut down a tree in my backyard. It was a dirty job, and when I was done I was splattered with a filthy mixture of sawdust and oil. In that condition I did not want anyone to see me. I just wanted to be cleansed in water so I would again feel comfortable in the presence of other people.\nNot one of you young men and not one of your leaders has lived without sin since his baptism. Without some provision for further cleansing after our baptism, each of us is lost to things spiritual. We cannot have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and at the final judgment we would be bound to be \u201ccast off forever\u201d (1 Ne. 10:21). How grateful we are that the Lord has provided a process for each baptized member of His Church to be periodically cleansed from the soil of sin. The sacrament is an essential part of that process.\nWe are commanded to repent of our sins and to come to the Lord with a brokenheart and a contrite spirit and partake of the sacrament in compliance with its covenants. When we renew our baptismal covenants in this way, the Lord renews the cleansing effect of our baptism. In this way we are made clean and can always have His Spirit to be with us. The importance of this is evident in the Lord\u2019s commandment that we partake of the sacrament each week (see D&C 59:8\u20139).\nWe cannot overstate the importance of the Aaronic Priesthood in this. All of these vital steps pertaining to the remission of sins are performed through the saving ordinance of baptism and the renewing ordinance of the sacrament. Both of these ordinances are officiated by holders of the Aaronic Priesthood under the direction of the bishopric, who exercise the keys of the gospel of repentance and of baptism and the remission of sins.\nIII.\nIn a closely related way, these ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood are also vital to the ministering of angels.\n\u201cThe word \u2018angel\u2019 is used in the scriptures for any heavenly being bearing God\u2019s message\u201d (George Q. Cannon, Gospel Truth, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist [1987], 54). The scriptures recite numerous instances where an angel appeared personally. Angelic appearances to Zacharias and Mary (see Luke 1) and to King Benjamin and Nephi, the grandson of Helaman (see Mosiah 3:2; 3 Ne. 7:17\u201318) are only a few examples. When I was young, I thought such personal appearances were the only meaning of the ministering of angels. As a young holder of the Aaronic Priesthood, I did not think I would see an angel, and I wondered what such appearances had to do with the Aaronic Priesthood.\nBut the ministering of angels can also be unseen. Angelic messages can be delivered by a voice or merely by thoughts or feelings communicated to the mind. President John Taylor described \u201cthe action of the angels, or messengers of God, upon our minds, so that the heart can conceive \u2026 revelations from the eternal world\u201d (Gospel Kingdom, sel. G. Homer Durham [1987], 31).\nNephi described three manifestations of the ministering of angels when he reminded his rebellious brothers that (1) they had \u201cseen an angel,\u201d (2) they had \u201cheard his voice from time to time,\u201d and (3) also that an angel had \u201cspoken unto [them] in a still small voice\u201d though they were \u201cpast feeling\u201d and \u201ccould not feel his words\u201d (1 Ne. 17:45). The scriptures contain many other statements that angels are sent to teach the gospel and bring men to Christ (see Heb. 1:14; Alma 39:19; Moro. 7:25, 29, 31\u201332; D&C 20:35). Most angelic communications are felt or heard rather than seen.\nHow does the Aaronic Priesthood hold the key to the ministering of angels? The answer is the same as for the Spirit of the Lord.\nIn general, the blessings of spiritual companionship and communication are only available to those who are clean. As explained earlier, through the Aaronic Priesthood ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, we are cleansed of our sins and promised that if we keep our covenants we will always have His Spirit to be with us. I believe that promise not only refers to the Holy Ghost but also to the ministering of angels, for \u201cangels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ\u201d (2 Ne. 32:3). So it is that those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood open the door for all Church members who worthily partake of the sacrament to enjoy the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord and the ministering of angels.\nIV.\nThe doctrines I have just discussed are contained in the scriptures. From the scriptures we also know that those who officiate in the priesthood act in behalf of the Lord (see D&C 1:38; D&C 36:2). I will now suggest how teachers and priests and deacons should carry out their sacred responsibilities to act in behalf of the Lord in preparing, administering, and passing the sacrament. I will not suggest detailed rules, since the circumstances in various wards and branches in our worldwide Church are so different that a specific rule that seems required in one setting may be inappropriate in another. Rather, I will suggest a principle based on the doctrines. If all understand this principle and act in harmony with it, there should be little need for rules. If rules or counseling are needed in individual cases, local leaders can provide them, consistent with the doctrines and their related principles.\nThe principle I suggest to govern those officiating in the sacrament\u2014whether preparing, administering, or passing\u2014is that they should not do anything that would distract any member from his or her worship and renewal of covenants. This principle of non-distraction suggests some companion principles.\nDeacons, teachers, and priests should always be clean in appearance and reverent in the manner in which they perform their solemn and sacred responsibilities. Teachers\u2019 special assignments in preparing the sacrament are the least visible but should still be done with dignity, quietly and reverently. Teachers should always remember that the emblems they are preparing represent the body and blood of our Lord.\nTo avoid distracting from the sacred occasion, priests should speak the sacrament prayers clearly and distinctly. Prayers that are rattled off swiftly or mumbled inaudibly will not do. All present should be helped to understand an ordinance and covenants so important that the Lord prescribed the exact words to be uttered. All should be helped to focus on those sacred words as they renew their covenants by partaking.\nOn this subject I feel to share a painful experience from my youth. As a 16-year-old priest, I was just beginning a part-time job as a radio announcer at a local station. After I offered a prayer at the sacrament table in our ward, a girl who was present told me I sounded like I was reading a commercial. Can you imagine the shame I felt? After 50 years that rebuke still stings. Brethren, remember the significance of those sacred prayers. You are praying as a servant of the Lord in behalf of the entire congregation. Speak to be heard and understood, and say it like you mean it.\nDeacons should pass the sacrament in a reverent and orderly manner, with no needless motions or expressions that call attention to themselves. In all their actions they should avoid distracting any member of the congregation from worship and covenant making.\nAll who officiate in the sacrament\u2014in preparing, administering, or passing\u2014should be well groomed and modestly dressed, with nothing about their personal appearance that calls special attention to themselves. In appearance as well as actions, they should avoid distracting anyone present from full attention to the worship and covenant making that is the purpose of this sacred ordinance.\nThis principle of non-distraction applies to things unseen as well as seen. If someone officiating in this sacred ordinance is unworthy to participate, and this is known to anyone present, their participation is a serious distraction to that person. Young men, if any of you is unworthy, talk to your bishop without delay. Obtain his direction on what you should do to qualify yourself to participate in your priesthood duties worthily and appropriately.\nI have a final suggestion. With the single exception of those priests occupied breaking the bread, all who hold the Aaronic Priesthood should join in singing the sacrament hymn by which we worship and prepare to partake. No one needs that spiritual preparation more than the priesthood holders who will officiate in it. My young brethren, it is important that you sing the sacrament hymn. Please do so.\nThe Aaronic Priesthood holds the keys of the \u201cgospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins\u201d (D&C 84:27). The cleansing power of our Savior\u2019s Atonement is renewed for us as we partake of the sacrament. The promise that we \u201cmay always have his Spirit to be with [us]\u201d (D&C 20:77) is essential to our spirituality. The ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood are vital to all of this. I testify that this is true, and I pray that our brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood will understand the importance of their sacred responsibilities and act worthily in them, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDallin H. Oaks\nThe Aaronic Priesthood and the Sacrament\n1998\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Some weeks ago an unhappy mother, who had been left alone to care for herself and her three young children, indicated that she was not attending church anymore: \u201cWhy should I? I have lived in the same apartment now for more than four months and not one person has come to call on us.\u201d\nShe seemed taken aback and surprised when, instead of saying, \u201cI will have the bishop contact you promptly,\u201d I asked, \u201cHow many people have you visited since you moved into your new neighborhood?\u201d\nMany of us set up roadblocks to progress and contribute to our own unhappiness while we wait for others to seek us out and offer help. Negative attitudes lived with today cause stagnation, misery, and bitterness tomorrow. It is unproductive for those who should be anxiously engaged in seeking the abundant life to nurse personal hurts. We are all God\u2019s children. If we love Him, we will feed His sheep wherever they may be found, without regard as to our own personal plight or situation. Often we can best feed others when we are hungry ourselves or not completely comfortable in the fold that we presently occupy. Very often those who are hungry, helpless, and cold can best be rescued by those who have been through the same exposures. Marking time or stalling should not be indulged in by the weak, weary, uncertain, and unrecognized. Instead, there is a healing power as we use our energy in action, in service, and in lifting others.\nIt was Booker T. Washington who wisely stated, \u201cSuccess is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.\u201d (The International Dictionary of Thoughts, comp. by John P. Bradley and others, Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Company, 1969, p. 698.) Victories in life come through our ability to work around and over the obstacles that cross our path. We grow stronger as we climb our own mountains.\n\u201cThe brightest crowns that are worn in heaven have been tried, and smelted, polished and glorified through the furnace of tribulation\u201d according to Thomas Carlyle (Vital Quotations, Emerson Roy West, comp., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968, p. 312).\nLet me share four basic contributing factors which might prevent our personal progress and church activity: (1) the constant nursing of personal hurts, (2) yielding to the sorrow of tragedy and grief, (3) being fettered with the habits and mistakes of misconduct, (4) letting fears inhibit progress.\nLet us ponder these enemies of eternal progress and seek ways of gathering the courage to cast them aside.\nThe constant nursing of personal hurts. Each of us should daily resolve that with God\u2019s help we will not allow careless words from others to shape our destiny or control our daily course. How tragic it is to see, on occasion, a life of usefulness lost because we have allowed an unkind comment to cause a wound or hurt. We let the injury become an open sore and fester rather than treat it with prompt skill and maturity. Some try to get even with their offenders by dropping out of life\u2019s race. How weak, how damaging, how self-restricting is the often used statement, \u201cI\u2019ll never go back as long asthat person is there!\u201d On occasion some of us seem to stand on the sidelines waiting to be hurt, offended, or ignored. We listen for careless words from others and remember the unsaid hellos and read into the said or unsaid words a totally unintended message.\nOne of the finest basketball players of all time was asked what had contributed the most to his outstanding success. His answer was, \u201cI learned to play in pain. Although injuries, bruises, and bumps came, I never allowed myself the luxury of slowing down or quitting.\u201d\nThe greatest teacher and leader also showed the world an example of proper conduct when He was the victim of unkind words and cruel deeds. He simply said, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they do\u201d (Luke 23:34).\nDuring his earthly mission Jesus made every confrontation a learning experience, including those that would be destructive or cause hurt and dissatisfaction. He was never rebellious, never ashamed; always long-suffering, patient, kingly; and never deterred in being about His Father\u2019s business. He, too, proved His greatness when His personal pain and suffering were the most intense. Hurting words and unkind deeds never kept Him from reaching His goals. No one can meet life in all its fulness without experiencing hurt, pain, and suffering.\nThe wise person will avoid the flood of bitterness and hatred that can be caused by the waters of hurt. He will constantly pursue the Savior\u2019s paths without stopping at this roadblock caused by apparent or real injustices. It is up to us to go forward and not confuse or confound ourselves. Those of us who cannot forgive and forget break the bridges over which we must pass. Too often we allow incidents to contribute to our stagnation when we permit ourselves to feel ignored, unwanted, or unworthy. How damaging sympathy is when it is self-administered. How refreshing it is to meet people who don\u2019t have time to be offended. Certainly what we are is more important than what we have or what is said of us.\nYielding to the sorrow of tragedy and grief. Too often the tragic loss of a child, husband, wife, mother, father, or other loved ones becomes a turning point in life. Some yield to the damaging thought that if there be an all-wise and loving Eternal Father, how could He allow this to happen to me and mine? We allow the heartache to break the band and strengthening tie to Him who has promised to see us successfully through our Gethsemanes. Some of us in our moments of greatest despair turn away in bitterness from the arm of strength, comfort, and peace. Sometimes in our darkest hours we lose sight of the light as we dwell upon the unanswerable questions: \u201cWhy does God permit this to happen to me or to our family? What have we done to deserve this?\u201d\nThis incident was shared by Lucile F. Johnson of Orem, Utah: \u201cThere was an attractive lady whose company everyone sought and enjoyed. She was a delight to be around because she seemed to love life and people to the fullest. One day I said to her, \u2018You are such a joy to all of us. What is your secret? Can you tell me?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 she answered. \u2018One word changed my life.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018And what was that word?\u2019 I queried.\n\u201c\u2018Malignant!\u2019 Startled, I heard this explanation: \u2018The doctor said that word to me and told me I had a limited time to live. I had a choice. I could make everyone miserable or I could try to make others happy. On my knees I realized that I had one day at a time just as everyone else has. I was able to see things I had never seen. My husband, my children, each person took on a beauty you can\u2019t believe. I know that life is a gift whether it be a day or a year and I intend to enjoy my gift to the maximum.\u2019\u201d\nWhether the works of God are manifest in healings or in the exhibition of courage and acceptance by those challenged must be left to the ultimate wisdom of Him who comprehendeth all things. How refreshing and strengthening are the lives of those who push upward and onward despite tragedies and griefs.\nOne ship drives east and another drives west\nWith the selfsame winds that blow.\n\u2019Tis the set of the sails\nAnd not the gales\nWhich tells us the way to go.\nLike the winds of the sea are the ways of fate,\nAs we voyage along through life:\n\u2019Tis the set of a soul\nThat decides its goal,\nAnd not the calm or the strife.\nBeing fettered with habits and mistakes of misconduct. A friend of mine who only in recent months has made giant steps toward purposeful living and complete activity in the Church shared the following: \u201cI can tell you as one who has had many years of experience and practice that it is much easier to criticize individuals and knock the establishment than it is to change oneself and recognize the real causes for one\u2019s own inactivity and negativism.\u201d\nChange is hard. Rather than going through the struggle to overcome a bad habit or rectify a mistake, some of us choose to make excuses for inactivity. Progress comes as we are able to give up something for something we want more. Honesty with oneself and setting of desirable but attainable goals day by day can determine the paths we follow. One might make a list of goals and then a price list for each goal. One day at a time the price of change can be paid. The cost will then not be overwhelming.\nThe Lord has promised that he will forgive and remember no more when the process of repentance is complete. If the Lord will do that for us, why should we not so do for ourselves? Mistakes can be forgiven. Habits can be changed. One more roadblock to progress can be removed.\nIn contrast to this process, how discouraging it is to witness someone who lives with damaging habits and who resists taking personal steps toward better self-management. William James said, \u201cThat which holds the attention determines the action\u201d (Vital Quotations, Emerson Roy West, comp. Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968, p. 5). The truly repentant will put their mistakes behind, learn from them, and turn their attention from them to actions that bring progress and growth. How comforting it is to know that God will take us by the hand and lift us to new levels of attitude and achievement if we will but let Him. What a sweet, personal victory it is to recognize misdirection in one\u2019s own life and to pay the price that then lets us walk in His paths.\nLetting fears inhibit progress. Fear is another roadblock which may stop our eternal progress. It keeps us from attempting anything significant because we are afraid of failure or rejection. We won\u2019t accept opportunities for service in the Church or in the community because we might make a mistake.\n\u201cFor God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind\u201d (2 Tim. 1:7). What a tragedy it is in our lives when we are afraid to try, afraid to make decisions, afraid to trust the Lord, or even afraid to make an error in judgment. Oh, that we could remember the great teaching of the Savior to Peter when fear caused him to fail to walk and to even sink.\n\u201cBut the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.\n\u201cAnd in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.\n\u201cAnd when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.\n\u201cBut straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.\n\u201cAnd Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\n\u201cAnd he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.\n\u201cBut when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.\n\u201cAnd immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\u201d (Matt. 14:24\u201331.)\nFears in our lives can be conquered if we will but have faith and move forward with purpose.\nTo reemphasize: the constant nursing of personal hurts is a crutch for those who would move with hesitation, if at all. Yielding to the pains of tragedy and grief deters self-development and takes away the opportunity for triumph over trying obstacles. Being fettered with habits and mistakes of misconduct relegates a person to being a victim of his errors. Letting fears inhibit progress is but another evidence of one\u2019s unwillingness to try because of the fear of failure. Roadblocks to eternal progress are cast aside when resolves are made that no man needs to walk alone. It is a happy day when we come to know that with God\u2019s help nothing is impossible for us.\nMay we strive for that day and knowledge, I humbly pray. God does live. He does hear and answer our prayers. To these truths I leave my testimony and witness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarvin\u00a0J. Ashton\nRoadblocks to Progress\n1979\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brethren, I am humbled by this opportunity and ask for an interest in your faith and prayers. May we be blessed and guided by the Spirit to hear and feel this evening.\nA number of years ago I received a telephone call that would change my life\u2014my eternal life.\nA good sister from my ward called to invite me to perform a dance floor show number at a Mutual activity evening that was being held in a couple of weeks. Dancing was a hobby of mine, and I was studying ballroom dancing at a studio in Salt Lake City. I had never been to a youth MIA dance before, and I was excited to accept the invitation to perform.\nMy partner and I arrived on the appointed evening and were greeted enthusiastically. I was surprised to find that we were the only ones on the program. It was an exciting experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\nThe following Sunday morning, I decided to go to church in our ward for the first time since I was ordained a deacon. At that time, none of my family was active. I found people who welcomed me warmly, and they demonstrated a genuine friendship and caring. These experiences started me on the road to activity and service in the Church that has been a joy to me throughout the years.\nThe senior Aaronic Priesthood committee, as it was called then, was a group of brethren who worked with men who were older than the normal Aaronic Priesthood age. These were just regular men who were doing what the Lord wanted them to do. They took me under their wing, and we became good friends. A wonderful returned missionary gave our class instruction. He taught the basics of the gospel and helped prepare me to serve a mission. During this same time I was asked to help teach dancing in the ward, which gave me a feeling of being needed, and it also gave me a responsibility.\nThe next 15 months flew by, filled with growth and happiness as I progressed. I soon received a call to serve a mission in Mexico. I quickly grew to love the language, the country, and its people. Sharing the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ gave me a foundation upon which to build the rest of my life.\nI know what it means to have a friend, a responsibility, and to be nurtured by the good word of God. There are many that do not understand what is missing in their lives and hunger for those tender feelings that come from knowing the love of our Savior. They are good people who lie dormant, as it were, awaiting the awakening of their soul by those who bring the \u201cgood news.\u201d There are others who watch us, observe our examples, and say, \u201cI like what I see; how can I become a part of it?\u201d\nI invite you brethren of the priesthood, both young and old, to look around you, seek out, and extend a warm hand of friendship to those less active and nonmembers. Invite them to participate with you. Become their friend, and you will make a difference and bless their lives for generations to come.\n\u201cRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;\n\u201cFor, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.\n\u201cAnd he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.\n\u201cAnd how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!\u201d1\nAnd may I add this wonderful promise of His: \u201cBehold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.\u201d2\nAt this Easter season, as we celebrate His Resurrection, let us focus our attention on the price that He paid so willingly for all of those who will follow Him and do His will.\nI invite all to come and enjoy these great blessings of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored.\nLet us cast aside the traditions of men, all the things that clutter our lives and lead us carefully away from what Moroni called \u201cthe right way,\u201d3 and lift our hearts to Him who has ransomed us, even Jesus Christ our Savior, and follow Him.\nListen to the feelings of your heart and follow its prompting as you hear the messages of this conference. You will be taught from on high and receive answers to your prayers.\nLet us go forth with greater enthusiasm to succor those in need and bring souls unto Him, that they may be fed, nurtured by His good word, and know His tender love. \u201cYou shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer is worthy of his hire,\u201d4 and there will be rejoicing in many hearts.\nThat evening so long ago when I was invited to share my talent, the door opened to a wonderful new world of friends and activity in the Church. I am grateful for those who reached out with a warm hand of fellowship, invited me in, nurtured me, and blessed my life.\nI leave you with my witness that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. This is His church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nNed B. Rouech\u00e9\nFellowshipping\n1999\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Many years ago when I was a college student, I was listening to general conference on the radio since we did not have a TV in our small apartment. The conference speakers were marvelous, and I was enjoying an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.\nI remember well as one General Authority spoke about the Savior and His ministry and then bore a fervent testimony, the Holy Spirit confirmed to my soul that he had spoken the truth. At that moment I had no doubt that the Savior lives. I also had no doubt that I was experiencing personal revelation which confirmed to me \u201cthat Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\u201d1\nAs an eight-year-old child I was baptized and confirmed and received the gift of the Holy Ghost. It was a wonderful blessing then but has become increasingly important as I have grown and experienced the gift of the Holy Ghost in many ways since then.\nOften as we grow from childhood to adolescence and then to adulthood, we have challenges and experiences along the way which cause us to know that we need the divine help that comes through the Holy Spirit. As struggles come, we may ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is the answer to my problem?\u201d and \u201cHow can I know what to do?\u201d\nI often remember the account in the Book of Mormon about Lehi teaching his family the gospel. He shared with them many revelations and teachings about things to come in the latter days. Nephi had sought the guidance of the Lord in order to more fully understand the teachings of his father. He was lifted, blessed, and inspired to know that the teachings of his father were true. That enabled Nephi to carefully follow the commandments of the Lord and live a righteous life. He received personal revelation to guide him.\nOn the other hand, his brethren were disputing with each other because they did not understand the teachings of their father. Nephi then asked a very important question: \u201cHave ye inquired of the Lord?\u201d2\nTheir response was a weak one: \u201cWe have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us.\u201d3\nNephi took that opportunity to teach his brethren how to receive personal revelation. He said: \u201cDo ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?\u2014If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.\u201d4\nThe way to receive personal revelation is really quite clear. We need to desire to receive revelation, we must not harden our hearts, and then we need to ask in faith, truly believe that we will receive an answer, and then diligently keep the commandments of God.\nFollowing this pattern does not mean that every time we ask a question of God, the answer will immediately appear with every detail of what to do. However, it does mean that if we diligently keep the commandments and ask in faith, answers will come in the Lord\u2019s own way and in His time.\nAs a child I thought personal revelation or answers to prayers would come as an audible voice. Indeed, some revelation does come by hearing an actual voice. However, I have learned that the Spirit speaks in many ways.\nDoctrine and Covenants, section 6, explains several ways in which we can receive revelation:\n\u201cThou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit.\u201d5\n\u201cI did enlighten thy mind.\u201d6\n\u201cDid I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?\u201d7\nIn other scriptures we learn more about receiving revelation:\n\u201cI will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.\u201d8\n\u201cI will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.\u201d9\n\u201cI will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.\u201d10\nMost often personal revelation will come as we study the scriptures, listen to and follow the counsel of prophets and other Church leaders, and seek to live faithful, righteous lives. Sometimes inspiration will come from a single verse of scripture or from a line in a conference talk. Perhaps your answer will come when the Primary children are singing a beautiful song. These are all forms of revelation.\nIn the early days of the Restoration, many members diligently sought revelation and were blessed and inspired to know what to do.\nSister Eliza R. Snow was given a charge from the prophet Brigham Young to help lift and teach the sisters of the Church. She \u201ctaught that individual women could receive inspiration to guide them in their personal lives, their families, and their Church responsibilities. She said: \u2018Tell the sisters to go forth and discharge their duties, in humility and faithfulness and the Spirit of God will rest upon them and they will be blest in their labors. Let them seek for wisdom instead of power and they will have all the power they have wisdom to exercise.\u2019\u201d11\nSister Snow taught the sisters to seek guidance from the Holy Ghost. \u201cShe said that the Holy Ghost \u2018satisfies and fills up every longing of the human heart, and fills up every vacuum. When I am filled with that Spirit, \u2026 my soul is satisfied.\u2019\u201d12\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf has taught that \u201crevelation and testimony do not always come with overwhelming force. For many, a testimony comes slowly\u2014a piece at a time.\u201d He further said: \u201cLet us earnestly seek the light of personal inspiration. Let us plead with the Lord to endow our mind and soul with the spark of faith that will enable us to receive and recognize the divine ministering of the Holy Spirit.\u201d13\nOur testimonies fortify us and strengthen us as we face challenges in our daily lives. Some people struggle with difficult health problems; some experience financial problems; others have challenges in their marriage or with their children; some suffer from loneliness or unfulfilled hopes and dreams. It is our testimony, combined with our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the plan of salvation, which helps to get us through these times of trial and hardship.\nIn the book Daughters in My Kingdom, we read about Sister Hedwig Biereichel, a woman in Germany who suffered much sorrow and deprivation during World War II. Because of her love and charitable nature, and even in her own great need, she willingly shared her food with starving prisoners of war. Later, when asked how she was able to \u201ckeep a testimony during all [those] trials,\u201d she replied in effect, \u201cI didn\u2019t keep a testimony through those times\u2014the testimony kept me.\u201d14\nBecause we have a strong testimony doesn\u2019t mean it will always remain that way. We must nourish and strengthen it in order that it will have sufficient power to sustain us. That is one reason why we \u201cmeet together oft\u201d\u2014so we can partake of the sacrament, renew our covenants, and be \u201cnourished by the good word of God.\u201d It is the good word of God that keeps us \u201ccontinually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who [is] the author and the finisher of [our] faith.\u201d15\nElder David A. Bednar has taught us: \u201cAs you appropriately seek for and apply unto the spirit of revelation, I promise you will \u2018walk in the light of the Lord\u2019 (Isaiah 2:5; 2 Nephi 12:5). Sometimes the spirit of revelation will operate immediately and intensely, other times subtly and gradually, and often so delicately you may not even consciously recognize it. But regardless of the pattern whereby this blessing is received, the light it provides will illuminate and enlarge your soul, enlighten your understanding (see Alma 5:7; 32:28), and direct and protect you and your family.\u201d16\nThe Lord desires to bless us with guidance, wisdom, and direction in our lives. He desires to pour down His Spirit upon us. Again, for personal revelation we need to desire to receive it, we must not harden our hearts, and then we need to ask in faith, truly believe that we will receive an answer, and then diligently keep the commandments of God. Then as we seek answers to our questions, He will bless us with His Spirit. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBarbara Thompson\nPersonal Revelation and Testimony\n2011\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "We have reviewed the annual financial report of the Church as of 31 December 1985 and the operations for the year then ended. The financial statements and operations reviewed by the committee include the general funds of the Church and of other controlled organizations, the accounts of which are maintained by the Finance and Records Department of the Church. We have also examined the budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures employed and the manner in which funds are received and expenditures are controlled. We determined that expenditures of general Church funds were authorized by the First Presidency and by budgetary procedures. The budget is authorized by the Council on Disposition of Tithes, composed of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. The Appropriations Committee, in weekly meetings, administers major expenditures under the budget.\nModern accounting technology and equipment are employed by the Finance and Records Department and other departments in keeping abreast of rapid Church expansion and changing methods of electronic data processing.\nThe Auditing Department, which is independent of all other departments, functions in the threefold capacity of performing financial audits, operational audits, and audits of the computer systems employed by the Church. These services are performed on a continuing basis for Church departments and other Church-controlled organizations, the accounts of which are maintained by or under the direction of the Finance and Records Department. These comprise worldwide operations including missions, schools, administrative offices, and departmental activities. The extent and scope of the Auditing Department services in safeguarding the resources of the Church are expanding to encompass the growth and widening activities of the Church. The audits of local funds of wards and stakes are performed by stake auditors, the reports of which are reviewed by the Church Auditing Department. Incorporated businesses owned or controlled by the Church, for which accounts are not maintained in the Finance and Records Department, are audited by an internal staff of certified public accountants, independent professional auditing firms, or government regulatory agencies.\nBased on our review of the annual financial report and other data, and our study of the accounting and auditing methods by which financial operations are controlled, together with continuing discussions with personnel of the Finance and Records and Auditing departments and Church legal representatives, we are of the opinion that the general funds of the Church, received and expended during the year 1985, have been properly accounted for in accordance with established procedures outlined herein.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCHURCH AUDIT COMMITTEE\nTed E. Davis\nWilford G. Edling\nThe Church Audit Committee Report\n1986\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "On sunlit days during the noon hour, the streets of Salt Lake City abound with men and women who for a moment leave the confines of the tall office buildings and engage in that universal delight called window shopping. On occasion I, too, am a participant.\nOne Wednesday I paused before the elegant show window of a prestigious furniture store. That which caught and held my attention was not the beautifully designed sofa nor the comfortable-appearing chair that stood at its side. Neither was it the beautiful chandelier positioned overhead. Rather, my eyes rested upon a small sign that had been placed at the bottom right-hand corner of the window. Its message was brief: \u201cFinishers Wanted.\u201d\nThe store had need of those persons who possessed the talent and the skill to make ready for final sale the expensive furniture that the firm manufactured and sold. \u201cFinishers Wanted.\u201d The words remained with me as I returned to the pressing activities of the day.\nIn life, as in business, there has always been a need for those persons who could be called finishers. Their ranks are few, their opportunities many, their contributions great.\nFrom the very beginning to the present time, a fundamental question remains to be answered by each who runs the race of life. Shall I falter or shall I finish? On the answer await the blessings of joy and happiness here in mortality and eternal life in the world to come.\nWe are not left without guidance to make this momentous decision. The Holy Bible contains those accounts, even those lessons, which, if carefully learned, will serve us well and be as a beacon light to guide our thoughts and influence our actions. As we read, we sympathize with those who falter. We honor those who finish.\nThe apostle Paul likened life to a great race when he declared: \u201cKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.\u201d (1 Cor. 9:24.)\nAnd before the words of Paul fell upon the ears of his listeners, the counsel of the preacher, even the son of David, king in Jerusalem, cautioned: \u201c\u2026 the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. \u2026\u201d (Eccl. 9:11.)\nCould the son of David have been referring to his own father? Judged by any standards, the greatest king Israel ever had was David. Anointed by Samuel, he was honored by the Lord.\nIn the first flush of his incredible triumphs, David rode the crest of popularity. As he achieved fresh victories, the women greeted him with a new song: \u201c\u2026 Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\u201d (1 Sam. 18:7.) In adoration the people exclaimed: \u201cBehold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\u201d (2 Sam. 5:1.)\nPower he won. Peace he lost.\nIt happened one evening when David was walking upon the roof of the king\u2019s house that he saw from the roof a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful.\n\u201cAnd David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, \u2026 the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\u201d So \u201cDavid sent messengers, and took her. \u2026\u201d (2 Sam. 11:3\u20134.)\nThe gross sin of adultery was followed by yet another: \u201c\u2026 Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.\u201d (2 Sam. 11:15.) Lust and power had triumphed.\nDavid\u2019s rebuke came from the Lord God of Israel: \u201c\u2026 thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife. \u2026 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house. \u2026\u201d (2 Sam. 12:9\u201310.)\nDavid commenced well the race, then faltered and failed to finish his course.\nLest we lull ourselves into thinking that only the gross sins of life cause us to falter, consider the experience of the rich young man who came running to the Savior and asked the question: \u201cGood Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\u201d\nJesus answered him: \u201cIf thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\n\u201cHe saith unto him, Which?\u201d\nTo Jesus\u2019 enumeration of the commandments, \u201cThe young man saith \u2026 All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\n\u201cJesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, \u2026 and come and follow me.\n\u201cBut when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.\u201d (Matt. 19:16\u201318, 20\u201322.)\nHe preferred the comforts of earth to the treasures of heaven. He would not purchase the things of eternity by abandoning those of time. He faltered. He failed to finish.\nSo it was with Judas Iscariot. He commenced his ministry as an apostle of the Lord. He ended it a traitor. For thirty paltry pieces of silver, he sold his soul. At last, realizing the enormity of his sin, Judas, to his patrons and tempters of his crime, shrieked: \u201cI have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.\u201d (Matt. 27:4.)\nRemorse had led to despair, despair to madness, and madness to suicide. He had succeeded in betraying the Christ. He had failed to finish the apostolic ministry to which he had been divinely called.\nLust for power, greed of gold, and disdain for honor have ever appeared as faces of failure in the panorama of life. Captivated by their artificial attraction, many noble souls have stumbled and fallen, thus losing the crown of victory reserved for the finisher of life\u2019s great race.\nConcerning those who fall short, John Greenleaf Whittier\u2019s words seem particularly fitting:\n\u201cFor of all sad words of tongue or pen,\nThe saddest are these: \u2018It might have been!\u2019\u201d\n\u2014\u201cMaude Muller\u201d\nMay we turn from the lives of those who faltered and consider for a moment some who finished and won the prize.\nThere was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil. Pious in his conduct, prosperous in his fortune, Job was to face a test that would tempt any man.\nShorn of his possessions, scorned by his friends, afflicted by his suffering, even tempted by his wife, Job was to declare from the depths of his noble soul: \u201c\u2026 behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.\u201d (Job 16:19.) \u201c\u2026 I know that my redeemer liveth. \u2026\u201d (Job 19:25.)\nJob did not falter. Job became a finisher.\nFollowing the earthly ministry of the Lord, there were many who, rather than deny testimony of him, would forfeit their lives. Such was Paul the apostle. The impulse of his father to send him to Jerusalem opened the door to Paul\u2019s destiny. He would pass through it and help to shape a new world. Gifted in his capacity to stir, move, and manage groups of men, Paul was a peerless example of one who nobly made the transition from sinner to saint. Though disappointment, heartache, and trial were to beset him, yet Paul, at the conclusion of his ministry, could say: \u201cI have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\u201d (2 Tim. 4:7.) Like Job, Paul was a finisher.\nHe admonished us to \u201clay aside \u2026 sin\u201d and to \u201crun with patience the race. \u2026 Looking [for an example] unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. \u2026\u201d (Heb. 12:1\u20132.)\nThough Jesus was tempted by the evil one, yet he resisted. Though he was hated, yet he loved. Though he was betrayed, yet he triumphed. Not in a cloud of glory or chariot of fire was Jesus to depart mortality, but with arms outstretched in agony upon a cruel cross. The magnitude of his mission is depicted in the simplicity of his words.\nTo his Father he prayed, \u201c\u2026 the hour is come. \u2026 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\u201d (John 17:1, 4.) \u201c\u2026 into thy hands I commend my spirit. \u2026\u201d (Luke 23:46.)\nMortality ended. Immortality began.\nTimes change, circumstances vary, but the true marks of a finisher remain. Note them well, for they are vital to our success.\n1. The Mark of Vision. It has been said that the doorways of history turn on small hinges, and so do people\u2019s lives. We are constantly making small decisions. The outcome determines the success or failure of our lives. That is why it is worthwhile to look ahead, set a course, and at least be partly ready when the moment of decision comes. True finishers have the capacity to visualize their objective.\n2. The Mark of Effort. Vision without effort is daydreaming, effort without vision is drudgery; but vision, coupled with effort, will obtain the prize.\nNeeded is the capacity to make the second effort when life\u2019s challenges lay us low.\n\u201cStick to your task \u2019til it sticks to you;\nBeginners are many, but enders are few.\nHonor, power, place and praise\nWill always come to the one who stays.\n\u201cStick to your task \u2019til it sticks to you;\nBend at it, sweat at it, smile at it, too;\nFor out of the bend and the sweat and the smile\nWill come life\u2019s victories after a while.\u201d\n\u2014Author Unknown\n3. The Mark of Faith. Long years ago the psalmist wrote: \u201cIt is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man: It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.\u201d (Ps. 118:8\u20139.) Recognize that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other.\n4. The Mark of Virtue. \u201c\u2026 let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly. \u2026\u201d (D&C 121:45.) This counsel from the Lord will provide staying power in the race we run.\n5. The Mark of Courage. Courage becomes a living and attractive virtue when it is regarded not as a willingness to die manfully, but the determination to live decently. Have the courage\u2014\n\u201cTo dream the impossible dream;\nTo fight the unbeatable foe;\nTo bear with unbearable sorrow:\nTo run where the brave dare not go.\n\u201cTo right the unrightable wrong;\nTo love, pure and chaste, from afar;\nTo try when your arms are too weary\nTo reach the unreachable star.\u201d1\n\u2014and you will thus become a finisher.\n6. The Mark of Prayer. When the burdens of life become heavy, when trials test one\u2019s faith, when pain, sorrow, and despair cause the light of hope to flicker and burn low, communication with our Heavenly Father provides peace.\nThese, the marks of a true finisher, will be as a lamp to our feet in the journey through life. Ever beckoning us onward and lifting us upward is he who pleaded, \u201c\u2026 come, follow me.\u201d (Luke 18:22.)\nFrequently his help comes silently\u2014on occasion with dramatic impact. Such was my experience of some years ago when, as a mission president, I was afforded the privilege of guiding the activities of precious young men and women, even missionaries whom he had called.\nSome had problems, others required motivation; but one came to me in utter despair. He had made his decision to leave the mission field when but at the halfway mark. His bags were packed, his return ticket purchased. He came by to bid me farewell. We talked; we listened; we prayed. There remained hidden the actual reason for his decision to quit.\nAs we arose from our knees in the quiet of my office, the missionary began to weep. Flexing the muscle in his strong right arm, he blurted out, \u201cThis is my problem. All through school my muscle power qualified me for honors in football and track, but my mental power was neglected. President Monson, I\u2019m ashamed of my school record. It reveals that \u2018with effort\u2019 I have the capacity to read at but the level of the fourth grade. I can\u2019t even read the Book of Mormon. How then can I understand its contents and teach others its truths?\u201d\nThe silence of the room was broken by my young nine-year-old son, who, without knocking, opened the door and, with surprise, apologetically said, \u201cExcuse me. I just wanted to put this book back on the shelf.\u201d\nHe handed me the book. Its title: A Child\u2019s Story of the Book of Mormon, by Dr. Deta P. Neeley. I turned to the foreword and read these words: \u201cThis book has been written with a scientifically controlled vocabulary to the level of the fourth grade.\u201d A sincere prayer from an honest heart had been dramatically answered.\nMy missionary accepted the challenge to read the book. Half laughing, half crying, he declared, \u201cIt will be good to read something I can understand.\u201d Clouds of despair were dispelled by the sunshine of hope. He completed an honorable mission. He became a finisher.\nToday I think I shall once more walk by that furniture store in our city and again gaze at the small sign in the large show window, that I may indelibly impress upon my mind the true meaning of its words: \u201cFinishers Wanted.\u201d\nI pray humbly that each one of us may be a finisher in the race of life and thus qualify for that precious prize: eternal life with our Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom. I testify that God lives, that this is his work, and ask that each may follow the example of his Son, a true finisher, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nThomas S. Monson\n\u201cFinishers Wanted\u201d\n1972\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I have heard that no one has ever died giving a talk in a general conference. If that is the case today, I sincerely apologize.\nWhile serving in the required military service in Argentina, I read a book whose author I do not remember. He wrote: \u201cI choose not to be an ordinary man; it is my right to be someone out of the ordinary, if I am able.\u201d\nTo be someone out of the ordinary means to be successful, unique, and outstanding.\nThat phrase has remained written in my mind and heart. My feelings were and are that we, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ, have chosen not to be ordinary men and women. The last words, \u201cif I am able,\u201d made me think that it is not enough to go through the motions of being baptized and confirmed, but rather we have to fulfill and honor the commitment that we made with the Lord on that memorable day.\nLehi taught his son Jacob, saying: \u201cWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself\u201d (2 Nephi 2:27).\nUndoubtedly, freedom and eternal life are what we seek. We tremble at the very thought of dying and being captives of the devil.\nNephi taught us clearly what we ought to do. He said, \u201cFor we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do\u201d (2 Nephi 25:23).\nI believe that the first thing we have to keep in mind in doing \u201call we can\u201d is to repent of our sins. We will never be able to reach our divine potential if we remain in our sins.\nI have fond memories of the day of my baptism when I was eight years old. It was performed in the Liniers Branch, the first chapel of the Church built in South America. After my baptism, as I was returning home along with my family, my oldest brother started wrestling with me, as he often did. I exclaimed, \u201cDo not touch me! I cannot sin!\u201d As the days passed, I realized that it was not possible to remain sinless for the rest of my life.\nIt is difficult to bear the sufferings that are inflicted upon us, but the real torment in life is to suffer the consequences of our own shortcomings and sins which we inflict upon ourselves.\nThere is only one way to rid ourselves of this suffering. It is by means of sincere repentance. I learned that if I could present unto the Lord a broken heart and a contrite spirit, feeling a godly sorrow for my sins, humbling myself, being repentant of my faults, He, through His miraculous atoning sacrifice, could erase those sins and remember them no more.\nThe Argentine poet Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, in his famous book Mart\u00edn Fierro, wrote:\nA man loses a lot of things\nand sometimes finds them again,\nbut it\u2019s my duty to inform you,\nand you\u2019ll do well to remember it,\nif once your sense of shame gets lost\nit will never again be found.\nIf we don\u2019t experience the godly sorrow that results from our sins or unrighteous actions, it will be impossible for us to remain on the way of outstanding people.\nAnother important principle to remember in doing \u201call we can do\u201d is to look for and develop the opportunities that life within the gospel constantly offers us and recognize that the Lord has given us all that we have. He is responsible for all that is good in our lives.\nAnother thing that must be our permanent responsibility is to do \u201call we can do\u201d to share the gospel of happiness with all mankind.\nSome time ago I received a letter from Brother Rafael P\u00e9rez Cisneros of Galicia, Spain, telling me about his conversion. Part of his letter said the following:\n\u201cI had no concept of the purpose of life or what the family really is. When I finally allowed the missionaries to come into my home, I told them, \u2018Give me your message, but I warn you that nothing is going to make me change religions.\u2019 On this first occasion my children and my wife were listening attentively. I felt separated from the group. I felt afraid, and without thinking I went to my bedroom. I closed the door and began to pray from the depths of my soul like I had never prayed before. \u2018Father, if it is true that these young men are Your disciples and have come to help us, please make it known to me.\u2019 It was in that very moment that I began to cry like a small child. My tears were abundant, and I felt happiness like I had never before experienced. I was absorbed in a sphere full of joy and happiness that penetrated my soul. I understood that God was answering my prayer.\n\u201cAll of my family was baptized, and we had the blessing of being sealed in the Swiss Temple, making me the happiest man in the world.\u201d\nI think this story should motivate us to do \u201call we can do\u201d to share the blessings of joy that come from living the gospel of happiness.\nThe final concept I want to share is that we should do \u201call we can do\u201d until the end of our mortal probation. Without question, we have living examples like President Gordon B. Hinckley and many other men and women who continue to faithfully serve at ages that others may consider inconvenient.\nWhen I served as president of the Spain Bilbao Mission, I was impressed with the quality of members and missionaries that I met, who moved the work forward with great ability and love, as do many faithful members of the Church in other parts of the world. To all of them, I express my sincere respect and admiration.\nThe Lord has said that He is \u201cdelight[ed] to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.\n\u201cGreat shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory\u201d (D&C 76:5\u20136).\nMay we always have in our minds and hearts the words of Nephi:\n\u201cAwake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 My soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation\u201d (2 Nephi 4:28, 30).\nIt is my humble prayer that the Lord may bless us to do \u201call we can do\u201d in this \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d path that we have chosen, which I testify to be true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nClaudio\u00a0D. Zivic\nAfter All We Can Do\n2007\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brethren: Last Saturday I was honored to speak to several hundred young men and women graduating seminary students from the high schools in Utah Valley. Under the leadership of a council of their own peers, they had planned a full day\u2019s activity, which included visits to Welfare Square and the Beehive House, a talent assembly, a devotional and testimony meeting, and a lovely dance. To my knowledge, the only adult who took active part was the area supervisor who introduced me. The rest of the adults present were there to give silent support and, by evening, were feeling their age after sharing a day of youthful vitality and enthusiastic activity.\nI wish every adult leader in the Church could have been in attendance to share the spirit of that testimony meeting. With deep emotion, one lovely girl spoke of her reaction when it was discovered that her father had cancer. How she prayed and prayed that he be healed, then came to the realization that her prayers were selfish\u2014that our loving Father in heaven was in control and that she should submit to his will. She evidenced a very mature outlook on life, something that some of us as adults never experience in a lifetime of living.\nA handsome young man, obviously a football player, told of how his testimony had been strengthened through association with fine, faithful friends, most of them a year older than he. Graduating from high school and soon to be separated from one another, they had a \u201clast fling\u201d together, a visit to the lovely grounds of the Provo Temple. Then they went to a quiet spot where in the late evening hours 12 future leaders of the Church bore their testimonies of the divinity of the gospel and expressed their love for one another.\nI have never heard so many expressions of love for friends and adult leaders who had influenced their lives.\nThe meeting was closed with \u201cI Know That My Redeemer Lives.\u201d I have never heard those beautiful lyrics sung with more genuine feeling. Tears fell freely as those great young people sang from their hearts.\nI mention their experience because it is so typical of many other experiences I have enjoyed among this royal generation of youth. As Bishop Brown has stated, there has never been a finer generation. I have great confidence that the kingdom of God will be in capable hands as they assume their future roles of leadership, and I am equally confident that they now are capable of assuming much more responsibility for their own welfare than we have been willing to give them.\nWith the new direction given to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA program, it now becomes our responsibility as adult leaders to give our youth the opportunity to grow in their capacity to lead, to serve, and to love.\nWhat a challenge adult leaders have in helping youth, particularly youth leaders, to learn their duty and perform to their fullest capacity while still leaving room for their own initiative and challenge as they anxiously engage in a good cause, doing many things of their own free will.\nThe Church leadership of the future will be built upon the foundation that is laid today. If youth are denied opportunities to test their own strength, then the leadership foundation will be weak and unready. Equally as serious, however, is thrusting unprepared youth leaders into situations in which they fail because the demands of that situation exceed their experience and capacity. Discouragement and doubt will result. The balance between enough responsibility and too much calls for fasting, prayer, and diligent service by youth and adult leadership as they labor together to build the kingdom. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization as introduced by Bishop Brown provides a setting where such a fine balance may be struck. With the bishopric of the ward\u2014the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood\u2014in direct charge, the bishop\u2019s youth committee, composed of the priests group leader, the Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidents, the girl class presidents, and the adult presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA, becomes a forum where youth leaders can communicate with the bishopric. They can be totally involved in selecting their activities and be tested and taught great leadership principles without being smothered by too many adult leaders. Yet, this youth committee expands to the ward Aaronic Priesthood council with the addition of the adult leaders of the age groups, who can temper unbridled enthusiasm and zeal with their experience and practicality, exercising some degree of control without dominating the youth councils.\nBishops, an effective youth committee is vital to the success of your Aaronic Priesthood program. It may surprise you what these bright young people will come up with in the way of individual and group service projects and meaningful activities or suggestions for implementing their program.\nIf you have not discovered it yet, you will. Our young men and women have a deep sense of purpose and a keen appreciation for our social needs. They want to be of service; they want to be useful; they want to make this a better world in which to live. Witness the joy of the youth who gathered by the hundreds to clean ditches and gather the debris left by the recent floods in southern Arizona, or those who cleaned up an entire Utah community in a day of service.\nAn active youth committee in Cache Valley made it their project to take care of the aged and shut-ins. Each week the girls would prepare suppers and the boys would prepare lessons or activities to take to the homes of the unfortunate, giving them plenty of tender loving care in a family home evening situation. What do you think that did for those young people to be involved in such a worthy, compassionate service?\nTheir deep desire to be of service and to demonstrate their love can even benefit the bishop. In Sacramento, California, while the bishop was away on vacation with his family, the youth committee determined to paint his house. These young people had the time of their lives working together and anticipating the pleasant surprise of the bishop when he returned. A real bond of love was established between the youth and their bishop with such meaningful service.\nBishops, we urge you to make use of your youth committee; make it the effective instrument it should be to meet the needs of the youth of your ward. I hope every one of you will keep in mind the words President David O. McKay gave us so stirringly: \u201cThe spirituality of a ward will be commensurate with the activity of the youth.\u201d\nYou will note, from Bishop Brown\u2019s explanation, that each member of the bishopric has been given a particular age group\u2014both boys and girls\u2014to direct. What a marvelous opportunity this gives for the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood to help our youth leaders learn the duties and responsibilities of their respective callings. And what a blessing it will be for our youth leaders to enjoy a close relationship with the great youth leaders of the ward.\nTo you Aaronic Priesthood quorum leaders, I hope you understand that the Lord outlined your duties as presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. He directed you to preside, to sit in council with your quorum members, and to teach them their duty. He didn\u2019t give that assignment to your advisers; he gave it to you. You share the responsibility, with the bishopric, of blessing the lives of every member of your quorum as you fulfill your sacred calling. What a transformation takes place when young Jack Smith becomes President John Smith, deacons quorum president, entitled to revelation from the Lord in directing the affairs of that quorum, and President Smith really assumes the responsibilities of his office. You are too young for such responsibility? The apostle Paul sensed something of the inadequacy young men feel when they are thrust into leadership. He counseled his young \u201cson in the faith,\u201d Timothy, \u201cLet no man despise thy youth. \u2026\u201d (1 Tim. 4:12.)\nDana Miller was approaching his twelfth birthday, looking forward to becoming a deacon. One evening, just prior to his birthday, the front doorbell rang. Dana\u2019s father, a high councilor in the stake, answered the door to find three young men on the porch. \u201cWe are the deacons presidency and have come to call on your son, Dana.\u201d Admitting these quorum leaders, Brother Miller retired to another room while the presidency sat down with Dana and outlined his duties and responsibilities as a priesthood holder. That visit had more impact on a boy\u2019s life than hours of counseling from an adult could have. Today Dana is president of the deacons quorum. What kind of a president do you think he is with that kind of an introduction to the priesthood and example from his leaders?\nThe Lord has assured us, \u201cFor the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.\u201d (D&C 58:28.)\nMy beloved young brethren, why are we so anxious to have you assume responsibility and learn your duties as priesthood bearers? Perhaps our reason was best stated by Elder Ezra Taft Benson in a speech he delivered to an Explorer conference several years ago. He said: \u201cWe are not a church of organized sitters; we are a church of organized workers, and we want you to get into it with all your enthusiasm and power. Young men, my brethren, we want you on the field. We want you sweating it out. We want you to have responsibility because you grow under responsibility.\u201d\nYou royal generation, you special people that God has reserved to come forth in this day, may God bless you with an understanding of who you are and bless you with a knowledge and understanding of the mission that he has in store for you. May your lives reflect that you are disciples of Jesus Christ, and may you, like our elder brother, grow in \u201cwisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man\u201d (Luke 2:52), that you will be prepared for the awesome responsibilities that he has before you. I challenge you to do so, to honor your priesthood and to show these good brethren of ours, who are placing increased responsibility on you as bearers of the priesthood, that you are worthy of that honor.\nI bear my witness to you that God is our Father, that he loves you. He has given you the opportunity to come to this life to gain a body and to experience the joys and the sorrows of life that you can return to him and be prepared for even greater service. May God bless all of us who render service to him. May we honor our priesthood and truly represent his cause, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nRobert L. Backman\nYouth\u2019s Opportunity to Serve\n1973\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "In the short period of time I stand at this pulpit, I would like to testify to you of my knowledge of the truthfulness of the doctrines and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nWe live in what is described as the period of most enlightenment since the creation of the world. Scientific achievements of today are staggering to the human mind. We realize that the law under which these achievements have been accomplished has always been in existence, but it was not until this era that man\u2019s learning and understanding have sufficiently increased to make use of natural laws to produce the accomplishments of today\u2019s world.\nA few generations ago, goods were produced with hand tools from crude materials; but in our day, mass production has replaced the old methods with greater efficiency and better quality because of the genius and skills of man and the machines he has developed.\nAgriculture is the means of livelihood for more than half of the world\u2019s population. As we pass through modernized farming areas, we no longer see farmers tilling the land with horse and plow, cutting one furrow at a time, or families working together in the fields at harvest time. These things seem to have disappeared. Today large pieces of mechanical equipment with the strength of a hundred horses plow many furrows at one time. Not many years ago the hand sickle was used to harvest the fields of ripened grain. The sheaves were flailed by hand and tossed into the wind to separate the chaff. Large combines now do all of the work in one operation as they mow the fields.\nHappenings in faraway places are viewed in the quiet of our own homes, a phenomenon which would have been considered a miracle in the generations preceding ours. Modern living requires that we have instantaneous communications at our side so that we may quickly dial and transact business or have the luxury of visiting, regardless of long intervening distances. Animals provided man\u2019s transportation for centuries, but these have now been replaced by vehicles of great speed and comfort. There has always been a curiosity as to what lies beyond the river. Today\u2019s rapid flight through the air has made the oceans no wider than the rivers of years past and man has quick access to the world.\nWe take great pride in modern accomplishments\u2014the fact that we are better housed and fed, have greater conveniences, improved medical facilities, greater advantages in education, and the highest standard of living ever enjoyed in the history of the world.\nMany of my ancestors were engaged in the world\u2019s most followed occupation of tilling the soil. Some of them left their old moorings in England and came to the shores of the New World, settling in the Plymouth and Massachusetts colonies. I get a warm feeling when I read the soul-stirring accounts of their conquest against hardship and the difficulties that faced them and their families.\nEarly missionaries of the Church went to Scotland, Denmark, and Norway, where other of my early ancestors lived. They accepted the teachings of the gospel, gave up the security of their homelands, and participated in the gathering to Zion. These people faced even greater hardships as they walked across the dusty plains of the Middle West and over the Rockies to the desert valleys of the mountains, pushing all of their earthly belongings in self-styled carts. The difficulties they endured bring tears to the eyes of those who are their beneficiaries today.\nThe stories of these people who have gone before us are ones of faith, devotion, and dedication. Although there were trials, hardships, and lack of the conveniences we think necessary in our world today, there seems to have been a happiness in their living, in their individual lives, and in their families. In their homes there was faith and prayer\u2014faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and prayers to God asking for their needs and thanking him for his goodness to them. The Bible was read in the home and there was profound belief in its teachings. Life was more simple, but can we say that there was less happiness in simplicity?\nSociety has made a great effort to modernize the world in education, communication, travel, health, commerce, housing, and in many other ways, so as to increase the standard of living; but what has this socialization and modernization done to the family\u2014the basic institution of society? Never before has there been greater instability. The divorce rate is higher now than at any time in history. Modernization has transferred the responsibility of education from the family to public institutions where modern thought has become paramount and moral principles have become abandoned. The crime rate has increased alarmingly. Drug addiction, disobedience to law, increase in venereal disease, and corruption in all forms seem to be accepted. In this day of modernization, freedom of thought and action is sponsored and promoted without consideration of the responsibilities that must accompany such freedoms if society is to be stabilized. Surely we would agree that the family institution has been seriously, if not irreparably, damaged in our society.\nIn the past, churches have taken a leading role in teaching men to have faith in God and to develop moral stability. What is happening to organized religion as a stabilizing force in society? Many of the largest of the Christian churches have reported losses in membership and also in income to carry on the work of their religious endeavors. Here again modernization has taken a heavy toll.\nModernism has become the order of the day in some religious thought. Modernists advocate a restatement of traditional doctrine on the grounds that today\u2019s modern scholastic and scientific advances require a new critical interpretation of the Bible and the history of dogma. The term \u201cmodernism\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201cliberalism.\u201d Its advocates claim that religious truths are subject to constant reinterpretation in the light of modern knowledge; therefore, new and more advanced concepts are required to express modern thought and progress.\nThe Bible has been the subject of attack by modernists. It is said by some that science refuses to support the authenticity of such Biblical accounts as the creation of the world, placing life upon the earth, Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the flood, and many other happenings in the Old and New Testaments. What is claimed to be superior knowledge in this day of enlightenment causes some men to look upon these accounts as fables. Because of this, can believers in Christ repudiate them? In an attempt to regain the confidence of communicants who have ceased to believe, many liberal churches have abandoned one doctrine after another, even to the extent of failing to stand by the doctrine of the existence of a personal God. They no longer uphold as a reality the resurrection of the crucified Savior, and the doctrine of the atoning sacrifice has lost its credibility. Under such circumstances, how can organized religion maintain its place as a stabilizing influence in society?\nIn this day of increased knowledge, higher thought, and a modernization of the old, the simple has been overlooked and the profound sought after. The basic, simple, fundamental truths of the gospel are being ignored. Paul taught the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of Galatia and, after he left them, spurious teachers came and turned them from his teachings. This gave rise to the letter written by Paul in strong language of criticism, denouncing those who would pervert his teachings. He said to them:\n\u201cI marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\u201d (Gal. 1:6\u20138.)\nFrom the earliest days of the Christian church, spurious gospels have been taught\u2014not really gospels, as Paul pointed out, for there is only one gospel of Christ. Today is not different. We are surrounded by frustrations and advances in thought and learning which raise questions and doubts. These seem to drag men down and destroy faith and morality. Where, then, is hope in this world of frustration and moral decay? It lies in the knowledge and understanding of the truths taught by the Master, which must be taught by the Church of Christ without deviation and believed in and lived by its membership. These are eternal truths and will be so in perpetuity regardless of changing circumstances in society, development of new scientific achievements, or increase of man\u2019s knowledge.\nI believe we can be modern and enjoy the fruits of a modern world and its high standard of living, and I believe we can have the benefits of modern scholarship and scientific advances without turning to the theories of the modernist. I believe the principles of the gospel announced by the Savior in his personal ministry were true when they were given and are true today. Truth is eternal and never changing, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is ever contemporary in a changing world.\nThe knowledge explosion of which the world is so proud is not of man\u2019s creation. It is his discovery of portions of the unlimited knowledge and information which is part of God\u2019s knowledge. How we use it is determined by whether we are of the eternal kingdom of God or a part of the temporary understanding of the world. The question is simply this: are we seeking to find our place in the world in the realm of worldly thought, or are we seeking to find our place in the unchanging kingdom of God?\nHow grateful I am for my membership and association in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which takes an undeviating course in the world of change, believing in being modern, of course, but not subjecting the doctrines and truths announced by the Savior to reexamination and alteration to express \u201cso-called\u201d modern thought and modern progress. We take no such course.\nContrary to the views of many modernists, I know that God our Eternal Father lives; that the Bible is inspired and the Book of Mormon is also an inspired writing; that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is real and also lives, having shed his blood for us, and is truly and literally resurrected. I also bear witness that there is a prophet of God on the earth today.\nMay the Lord bless us in our righteous endeavors to shun the influences that lead into the ways of the world, that we may take our place, in faith and believing, in the kingdom of God, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nHoward W. Hunter\nOf the World or of the Kingdom?\n1973\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "True disciples of the Master are teachable. In just a few words, Abraham gives us much insight into why he was so greatly blessed. He lived a life \u201cdesiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God.\u201d1 \u201cDesiring to receive instructions\u201d is more than a willingness to listen. When our desire to receive instruction is a greater force than our comfort in remaining as we are, we become teachable.\nPresident Brigham Young taught our \u201cfirst and foremost duty [is] to seek the Lord until we open the path of communication from God to our own soul.\u201d2 Shortly after his death, the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared in a dream to Brigham Young and instructed him: \u201cTell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the Kingdom.\u201d3\nHow do we ignite this power of divine instruction in our lives? First, we need to start with a willingness to be instructed. While many naturally hunger and thirst after righteousness, others may be compelled to be humble.4 Some of us, rather than follow instructions or change ourselves, would simply like to change the rules. Naaman certainly wanted to be rid of his leprous flesh but went away in a rage when told by the prophet\u2019s messenger to simply wash seven times in the River Jordan. It was inconvenient, a little thing, and he felt that the rivers in his land were better than the Jordan. But his leprosy was cured as he listened to his servants, changed his mind, and did \u201caccording to the saying of the man of God.\u201d5 He was dramatically shown that there was a prophet and a God in Israel. We too must realize that God has governing laws6 and that His wisdom is greater than our own. Even Moses observed, after seeing God\u2019s majesty and workmanship, \u201cMan is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.\u201d7\nSecond, we need to put ourselves into a proper frame of mind and heart. This comes by prayerful pondering and laboring in the Spirit.8 This labor is real labor. It includes the very active steps of seeking, hearkening, and studying the scriptures. When humbled and stripped of pride, our heart is softened and now we can focus on heavenly counsel and instruction. Lamoni\u2019s father, the powerful Lamanite king, made just that change in focus, even prostrating himself to the earth, demonstrating his great commitment to know God. He declared, \u201cI will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.\u201d9\nThird, we must be obedient to the instruction we receive. Alma said, \u201cExperiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith.\u201d10 Nephi simply said, \u201cI will go and do.\u201d11 What a wonderful attitude of submission and obedience as he accepted his father\u2019s counsel in getting the brass plates and in being told where to hunt, and the Lord\u2019s counsel in building a ship.12 In each case he proceeded with trust, moving forward, \u201cnot knowing beforehand the things\u201d13 that he should do or the outcome. But since we are free agents, life can sometimes be a difficult journey of applying our hearts and minds to the truths of God. Nevertheless, as President Thomas S. Monson said, \u201cThe Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. He expects our labors.\u201d14\nBecoming teachable is a process of learning line upon line. In this process we convert thoughts and feelings into actions. But what a reward for this exercise of our faith as we open the path of communication with the Lord. The Lord said, \u201cBlessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom.\u201d15 And He also said, \u201cEvery one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.\u201d16\nSome years ago I remember asking my father-in-law, a seasoned bishop, about a three-by-five-inch card he always carried in his shirt pocket. His reply was that at times he felt impressions or promptings. He then liked to pull out that card and write down those feelings, whenever they came. And then he tried to act upon them as quickly as possible. It is humbling to consider that the still, small voice is always there for us, teaching us what to do and where to go. The Lord tells us that when the promptings are heeded, often more are given. If we do not follow them, the promptings eventually diminish.\nAs a result of being teachable, we gain an even greater testimony of our Heavenly Father\u2019s care for us. We gain the security and certainty that our course in life is according to His will.17 We even have reasons to be good, reasons to be moral, and reasons to change our behavior. By being teachable, we activate the full force and blessings of the Atonement in our lives. We become sensitive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit so that the righteous principles taught by the prophets and the truths from the earth can place Christ deeply into our lives.18 We become His true disciples.\nIt is by loving these truths with all of our heart that an affinity develops between us and the Source of truth itself, \u201cfor intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; [and] virtue loveth virtue.\u201d19 Hence, we shall discover that the things we value and appreciate the most are those that we personally learned from the Lord.\nI testify that through the Prophet Joseph Smith we have received countless revelations of truth, bearing testimony of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Being teachable we will more clearly see, hear, and adhere to those revelations continuing even today through our living apostles, prophets, seers, and revelators. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRobert R. Steuer\nBeing Teachable\n2002\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "It is a great privilege, honor, and responsibility to stand before and speak to the priesthood assembled in this historic Tabernacle and in the 800 other buildings in the United States and Canada. This is the largest group of priesthood ever gathered to hear the voice of the Prophet, and when we think that they can hear this through closed circuit transmission as he speaks to them, it reminds me that we have an open conduit and a private closed circuit or wave length by which we can speak to our Heavenly Father and hear him, if we keep in tune and try to listen to him.\nI often wonder if we really appreciate what the priesthood means. President Romney, who is so close to the Lord, has given us some instructions tonight which, if we would follow, would help us to appreciate the priesthood and enjoy the blessings of those who magnify their callings in the priesthood. If I should say in my talk tonight to magnify the priesthood, I should like it to mean to be in complete harmony with President Romney, to magnify the priesthood in the office which you hold, because that is what we should do, my brethren. We have this heavy responsibility placed upon us when we are given the priesthood of God.\nEvery time I think of the priesthood, I think of the great honor and privilege we have of speaking and acting in the name of our Heavenly Father, and the responsibility it places upon us. I often say, \u201cWhat are we going to do about it? Are we going to realize who we are, what we have, and what our responsibilities are?\u201d\nI would like to say to you young men: Have a good time; play basketball, play football; play tennis; play anything you want to play, and do anything you want to do as long as it is right, but honor your priesthood wherever you are, that you might be an example to the world.\nI would like to deal briefly with the question of how we as priesthood holders should live, and I would like to say just a few words first about the family. The father must realize always that the family is the most important thing in his life. He should never neglect his family. As he looks after his family, he should remember that if he is going to enjoy the family now and throughout eternity, it is essential that they live according to the teachings of the gospel, and remember that \u201cno other success can compensate for failure in the home.\u201d Remember too that it is in the home that the most impressive teachings are taught and where the lives of our children are shaped.\nIf the father will love God, love his wife, love his family, and honor his priesthood, he will have very little to worry about. If all the priesthood would do that throughout the world, what a great influence we would have. Some will be saying: \u201cWhat about the girls, and the mothers, and the women?\u201d The same is true for them, but I am speaking to the priesthood and how they should act.\nKeep the Sabbath day holy. Keep the Word of Wisdom strictly. Pray always, and be honest with one another and with your fellowmen. Study the gospel. Know what is expected of us, why we are here, that we are actually spirit children of God, and as such we must keep ourselves morally clean. And that is one thing, fathers, that we should teach our boys to do.\nI should like to give you, as I speak about the family and fathers, an example by reading what Sister McKay said about President David O. McKay: \u201cI am very, very proud of my husband. He is just as lovely, just as courteous, just as polite, just as kind and just as sweet in our home as he is anywhere else, and I am very proud of him. And I am grateful for him. I cannot see anything wrong with him. I pray that our brethren will try to follow his example in every way, shape, and form.\u201d\nAnd I can\u2019t think of much better advice, brethren, for us to have.\nAs an example of good teaching, I remember a young man telling me one day about his parents and how they taught him the importance of going to the temple and preparing himself to be worthy to go into the house of the Lord by going to the temple regularly. As they were preparing to go to the temple, they would talk about it, and the experiences they would have, and what a great privilege it was to go to the temple, and to go regularly. When they would return from the temple, they would talk about it, and how lovely it was to see a young couple married in the temple, realizing that they could then be parents of spirit children of God, and what a great privilege it was for them to be there in the temple. This boy could hardly wait then for the time to come when he could go in and receive his own endowments, and he knew how important it was to prepare himself to be clean and pure and to go there knowing that the Lord would accept him.\nPersonally, I should like to express the appreciation I have always felt for my father. Father taught us to pray. It seemed that he was talking directly to the Lord when he kneeled down in family prayer. He taught us to pray privately. He was honest and honorable in all of his dealings. I wish I had time to tell you some of the experiences I had to let me know that he was honest and upright in his dealings with his fellowmen. He magnified his priesthood, and he expected us to do it. He always showed great love for Mother.\nHe used to take us hunting or fishing, as busy as we were on the farm. He found it difficult, I am sure, to leave, but he would go with us, and he would never go on Sunday; he never thought of that. We always attended our meetings regularly with him. I remember some of my friends saying, \u201cI wish I had a dad like yours. It is sure great to be with him.\u201d And I can tell you that we boys\u2014there were four of us\u2014would rather be with our dad than anybody else because he was a good father. Fathers, it is important that you be with your boys so they can see how you live, and you can see how they live.\nI remember Father\u2019s placing confidence in me. We used to work on the farm, as I said before, and he would call me in the evening or early morning to discuss his plans, his program for the day, and ask me what I thought about it. Should we do this or should we do that? I felt that I was a part of it. I know now that he had his plans pretty well formed, but he showed that confidence in me. And realizing that I was part of it, I worked my head off to accomplish it, and I loved my dad for it.\nAnd then I remember him saying to me one day, \u201cYou know, my son, I would rather have you helping me than any hired man I have. I have full confidence in you, and you surely do a good day\u2019s work.\u201d Such an expression of confidence and appreciation makes one more determined to do well what he is expected to do.\nIt is very important that we help our boys set their goals high and then set about to reach them. We must understand that Satan is there and is real, as has been told us twice tonight, and is determined to destroy us, to discourage us, to tempt us, and to lead us astray.\nI should like to repeat a beautiful experience, which is very touching to me. I hope Bishop Featherstone won\u2019t mind my mentioning him as the one about whom I am going to speak. This happened just after they moved here from their lovely home, where they had many friends and were very popular. He had come home after work and had gotten into his lounging clothes, and his young son, Joe, said, \u201cDad, I wish you would give me a special blessing so that I can adjust and feel at home and be happy here.\u201d\nHis father went upstairs and changed his clothes. As he was coming down, his wife said, \u201cSurely you are not going out tonight.\u201d He said, \u201cI am going to give someone a blessing.\u201d And then he said, \u201cJoe has asked for a special blessing, and I wanted to be dressed and ready to honor the priesthood and to show Joe the interest I have in him, and to make it possible for him to enjoy the blessings through the faith he has in me and the priesthood.\u201d\nBrethren, that is the spirit to have. And, of course, as he told his wife, you can naturally imagine what happened. She shed tears as she realized she had a husband, the father of her son, who would be an example and be so interested in him that he would be prepared to represent the Lord in the priesthood that he holds.\nI would like to say just a few words to the bishops, to the other officers in the wards and stakes, including the stake presidents, and to mission presidents. We have a heavy responsibility; and especially the bishop, with his counselors, has the responsibility for the Aaronic Priesthood. Much has been said about that tonight, but I would like to say just a few words. You should know every boy by his first name. Show an interest in him; stay close to him. When you know his first name, use it. You remember when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph, and he asked the question, God turned to him and said, \u201cJoseph,\u201d calling him by name, \u201cthis is my beloved Son.\u201d (See JS\u2014H 1:17.) A boy likes to hear his name called.\nLet us remember and remind our boys always, when they are officiating as holders of the priesthood, that they are representing the Lord. They can have their good times every other place and play the way they want to do, but when they are officiating in the priesthood, they should realize that they are representing the Lord, and be so dressed and so prepared and humble and reverent as to properly represent him.\nAnd bishops, it is important that we help them to understand and appreciate what the priesthood means. When I was a bishop I had six boys in my ward old enough to be ordained elders. I could only recommend five of them, because one of them wasn\u2019t ready. We had talked about it several times, and he had said to me, \u201cI am not worthy.\u201d He felt very bad about it, but he didn\u2019t expect to be recommended to the stake president. His uncle came to me and said, \u201cYou are surely not going to hold that boy back with his five friends going forward.\u201d He pled with me to let him go. He said, \u201cYou will be driving him out of the Church if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nI explained to this man, \u201cThe priesthood is the most important thing that we can give this boy. We are not handing the priesthood out on a silver platter. This boy and I understand each other, and he is not ready to be ordained an elder.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t recommended.\nA few years later I was attending a general conference right here on this Temple Square, and a young man came up to me and said, \u201cPresident Tanner, you wouldn\u2019t remember me. I am the boy whom you didn\u2019t recommend to be ordained an elder.\u201d As he put his hand out, he said, \u201cI want to thank you for it. I am a bishop now in California. If you had recommended me when I wasn\u2019t worthy, I possibly never would have appreciated what the priesthood is and what is expected of one, and surely I would never have been a bishop as I am today.\u201d\nBishops, these young men don\u2019t expect something for nothing. They don\u2019t appreciate anything they get for nothing, and they should realize and appreciate just what the priesthood means and then be prepared to qualify and be worthy before they are advanced.\nBy a searching interview, know that they are ready for a temple recommend, for advancement in the priesthood, for a mission, or anything that you are considering them for, and be sure they are ready. It is certainly no kindness to recommend someone when he is not ready\u2014in fact, it is a great disservice and it shouldn\u2019t be done. Help them to appreciate what it means and the importance of being ready and worthy. Encourage them, let them know that you love them, and do all you can to help them prepare.\nI would like to say, bishops, that as fathers of the wards you have the great privilege, the great joy of directing all the affairs in the ward and of helping these young men to become the kind of young men who will be the leaders in the ward and in the stake, and someday sitting on this stand\u2014some of them certainly will be. Help them to prepare and help them to appreciate that they might be holding responsible positions. And let me say this to you tonight: It is not possible for everyone holding the priesthood to be called to positions of leadership, but holding the priesthood of God is a great privilege, a great blessing, and it alone, if we honor it, will prepare us for salvation and exaltation, if we are ready to serve the Lord wherever we are called. The priesthood of God is something the world doesn\u2019t have.\nBishops, you have an additional responsibility. You are judges in Israel, and you should always judge and deal with the transgressor with love and confidence, with a desire in your heart to help him, and carry out your responsibilities to deal with him. Stake and mission presidents also have this responsibility. It is important that when you know there is iniquity, you be kind enough to show an interest in the transgressor and bring him to repentance, and that is a kindness. Love all, but tolerate no iniquity. When it appears that something is wrong, it is your duty to investigate and handle all cases of transgression according to the seriousness of the case. By moving promptly, you might be able to prevent further transgression.\nStudy the scriptures and the handbook and do as they direct. Bishops and stake presidents must not shirk this responsibility. Anyone who says that he has never disciplined, disfellowshiped, or excommunicated anyone, and that he never intends to, has an entirely wrong attitude and may himself be held accountable.\nThe Lord has said, \u201cAny member of the church of Christ transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct.\u201d (D&C 20:80.)\nAnd President John Taylor said this: \u201cFurthermore, I have heard of some Bishops who have been seeking to cover up the iniquities of men; I tell them, in the name of God, they will have to bear them themselves, and meet that judgment; and I tell you that any man who tampers with iniquity, he will have to bear that iniquity, and if any of you want to partake of the sins of men, or uphold them, you will have to bear them. Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in a position to tamper with the principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.\u201d (Conference Report, April 1880, p. 78.)\nThe cases that are to be handled by the Church include but are not limited to fornication, adultery, homosexual acts, abortion, or other infractions of the moral code; intemperance; criminal acts involving moral turpitude, such as burglary, dishonesty, theft, or murder; apostasy; open opposition to and deliberate disobedience of the rules and regulations of the Church; cruelty to spouse or children; advocating or practicing so-called plural marriage; or any un-Christianlike conduct in violation of the law and order of the Church.\nThose who are guilty of transgression are never happy until they confess their sins and repent. Experience has proven that every transgressor who is dealt with as he should be, with love and a desire to help and with the proper discipline, is able to start out anew with a clear conscience and can then and only then progress as he could not do otherwise. He will thank you for it, and as you try to help him, the Lord will bless both you and the repentant individual.\nI would like to say just a few words to the boys and young men as priesthood holders\u2014the young men particularly. You have been told what your responsibility is tonight. I want to impress upon you the importance of keeping morally clean. Prepare yourselves for the great blessings that come only through the priesthood, such as temple blessings, filling missions, and doing other things that you can do in the offices you hold. No man, young or old, who holds the priesthood of God can honor that priesthood without honoring and respecting womanhood. Any young man should be prepared to protect a woman\u2019s virtue with his life, if necessary, and never be guilty of lusting after a woman or doing anything that would degrade her or cause her to lose her virtue. Every young woman has a perfect right to feel safe in going out with a young man holding the priesthood, knowing that he will respect and protect her in every way.\nWe all know that the morals of the world are loose. Though we are in the world, we must not be of it. Whether your associates are members of the Church or not, and whether or not they are transgressors, they will expect you who hold the priesthood to honor that priesthood and will respect you if you do. Otherwise, they lose confidence in you and respect for you and for the Church.\nIf we would live each day so that we could look the bishop, branch president, the stake president, the president of the Church, or the Lord in the eye and say, \u201cI am doing my best to magnify my priesthood,\u201d then we would be safe.\nNo young man guilty of serious transgression should apply for a temple recommend or expect to be called on a mission or wish to be advanced in the priesthood until he has repented and is worthy of such a call. I can think of no greater disappointment, sadness, or sorrow that can come to anyone than to have a missionary who is not worthy, not dedicated, and guilty of transgression, be sent home dishonorably released, disfellowshiped, or excommunicated. This is a great disappointment to his companion, and it makes the mission president\u2019s heart bleed to have to deal with one of his missionaries who is guilty of transgression either before coming or while in the mission field, and then to have the difficult responsibility of sending him home. It distresses the parents and grieves the bishop and stake president and those with whom he has worked so closely. It is an affront to the Lord and seriously affects the life of the missionary.\nMay the Lord help us to appreciate who we are and to live accordingly, realizing that we do hold the priesthood of God in the church of Jesus Christ, the only men in the world who hold the authority to speak in God\u2019s name. Assembled here tonight in these different buildings, every priesthood office of the Church is represented, and the success and progress of this church depend on you as individuals who hold the priesthood. May we prove worthy, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nN. Eldon Tanner\nPriesthood Responsibilities\n1973\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "This morning I want to speak primarily to the young men and young women of the Church. I pray for the Spirit to help me inspire you young people to want to live righteous lives.\nSome of you may not understand our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan well enough to appreciate how important living a morally clean life is if you want to enjoy peace, happiness, and self-esteem. When you understand, the truths of the gospel will give you the guidance you need to be worthy members of the Church. When you accept the basic principles of the gospel and commit to live them, you will have the spiritual insight that will help you to be young men and women of purity, integrity, and faith.\nUnfortunately, we live in a world that is awash in all kinds of moral pollution, including drugs, violence, filthy language, pornography in literature; and videotapes, films, and television shows that promote illicit sex and promiscuity as being normal. A national debate is raging to make elective abortion acceptable.\nWith challenges like these, you need to remember that you do not face them alone. There are people who love you and want you to be happy. We want the very best for you. Most especially, your Father in Heaven loves you and wants you to have joy and happiness. He has made marvelous promises to His faithful children who love Him, who are baptized, and who keep His commandments.\nWhen you entered the waters of baptism, you made a promise to the Lord that you would \u201chumble [yourselves] before God, \u2026 and witness before the church that [you] have truly repented of all [your] sins, and are willing to take upon [yourselves] the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by [your] works that [you] have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of [your] sins.\u201d (D&C 20:37.) You were therefore bound by covenant to \u201ca godly walk and conversation, \u2026 walking in holiness before the Lord.\u201d (D&C 20:69.)\nMany of you were baptized when you were eight years old, and you may not realize that this is the promise you made to your Heavenly Father when you were baptized. Always remember that you are under this covenant. Your Heavenly Father has promised in return that He will give marvelous blessings to those who honor their covenants, keep His commandments, and endure faithfully to the end. They will be sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise and will be \u201cgiven all things\u201d (D&C 76:55; emphasis added; see also D&C 76:50\u201354, 70), including an inheritance in the celestial kingdom (see 2 Ne. 31:16\u201320).\nThe Apostle Paul wrote that \u201ceye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d (1 Cor. 2:9.) Those who live clean lives and keep the commandments \u201cshall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.\u201d (D&C 76:62.) They \u201cshall have eternal life \u2026 the greatest of all the gifts of God.\u201d (D&C 14:7.)\nI remind you young men who have been ordained to the priesthood that you have made an additional covenant with God. When you were ordained, you made a sacred promise with the Lord that you would honor your priesthood faithfully. (See D&C 84:33\u201342.) We are pleased to know that many of you are true and faithful in every way to your priesthood covenants and are preparing yourselves to receive the Lord\u2019s promised blessings. Unfortunately, we know also that too many young men of the priesthood pay little attention to the serious nature of their sacred promises made with Heavenly Father. Let me explain why you young men and women must keep your covenants you have made with God.\nIn the premortal world before we left the presence of Heavenly Father, He warned and cautioned us about new experiences we would have in mortality. We knew that we would have a physical body of flesh and bone. Never having been mortal before, we had no experience dealing with the temptations of mortality. But Heavenly Father knew and understood. He charged us to control our mortal bodies and to make them subject to our spirits. Our spirits would have to master the physical temptations that our bodies would encounter in a temporal world. Spiritual power over the influence of Satan comes to us by keeping the commandments of our Lord, Jesus Christ.\nBeing here on earth for the first time in our eternal existence, we are away from the protective presence of our Father in Heaven and are subject to the influence of Satan and his followers. Remember that Satan even tried to tempt the Savior into betraying the promises He had made to God. After Jesus was baptized, He went into the wilderness to fast and pray for forty days. Satan chose that moment during Christ\u2019s hunger and physical weakness to tempt Him. But Jesus did not succumb; He stood firm.\nSatan will seek to tempt us at times and in ways that exploit our greatest weaknesses or destroy our strengths. But his promises of pleasure are short-lived deceptions. His evil design is to tempt us into sinning, knowing that when we sin we separate ourselves from our Heavenly Father and the Savior, Jesus Christ. We begin to move away from Heavenly Father\u2019s promised blessings toward the misery and anguish in which Satan and his followers languish. By sinning we put ourselves in Satan\u2019s power.\nNow, my dear young friends, I understand the struggles you face every day in keeping the commandments of the Lord. The battle for your souls is increasingly fierce. The adversary is strong and cunning. However, you have within your physical body the powerful spirit of a son or daughter of God. Because He loves you and wants you to come home to Him, our Father in Heaven has given you a conscience that tells your spirit when you are keeping the Lord\u2019s commandments and when you are not. If you will pay more attention to your spiritual self, which is eternal, than to your mortal self, which is temporary, you can always resist the temptations of Satan and conquer his efforts to take you into his power.\nYou must be honest with yourself and remain true to the covenants you have made with God. Do not fall into the trap of thinking you can sin a little and it will not matter. Remember, \u201cthe Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\u201d (D&C 1:31.) Some young men and women in the Church talk openly about sexual transgression. They seem to forget that the Lord forbids all sexual relations before marriage, including petting, sex perversion of any kind, or preoccupation with sex in thought, speech, or action. Some youth foolishly rationalize that it is \u201cno big deal\u201d to sin now because they can always repent later when they want to go to the temple or on a mission. Anyone who does that is breaking promises made to God both in the premortal life and in the waters of baptism. The idea of sinning a little is self-deception. Sin is sin! Sin weakens you spiritually, and it always places the sinner at eternal risk. Choosing to sin, even with the intent to repent, is simply turning away from God and violating covenants.\nGratefully, many of you young men honor your priesthood and many young women \u201cstand for truth and righteousness\u201d as stated in the Young Women\u2019s motto. (Young Women Leadership Handbook, Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1992, p. 5.) We commend you for your fidelity and integrity.\nFor those who have strayed, the Savior has provided a way back. But it is not without pain. Repentance is not easy; it takes time\u2014painful time! You deceive yourself if you believe you can break the promises you have made with Heavenly Father and suffer no consequence.\nYou sustain the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. We prepared for you a pamphlet entitled For the Strength of Youth. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1990.) Most of you know that this inspired pamphlet contains guidelines to help you measure your moral conduct. I urge you to read every word over and over again so you will understand what the Lord and His church expect of you. The First Presidency message is so important that I will quote a few statements from it.\n\u201cOur beloved young men and women,\n\u201cWe want you to know that we love you. We have great confidence in you. Because of that, we talk to you frankly and honestly. \u2026\n\u201cGod loves you as He loves each and every one of His children. His desire, purpose, and glory is to have you return to Him pure and undefiled, having proven yourselves worthy of an eternity of joy in His presence. \u2026\n\u201cWe counsel you to choose to live a morally clean life. The prophet Alma declared, \u2018Wickedness never was happiness\u2019 (Alma 41:10). Truer words were never spoken!\n\u201cYou cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible! \u2026\n\u201cWe pray that you\u2014the young and rising generation\u2014will keep your bodies and minds clean, free from the contaminations of the world, that you will be fit and pure vessels to bear triumphantly the responsibilities of the kingdom of God in preparation for the second coming of our Savior.\u201d (Pp. 3\u20135.)\nPlease make sure you have a copy of the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth and regularly read it. Carry the small wallet-sized summary card with you. Read carefully the section in the pamphlet that teaches principles of sexual purity and follow the counsel with exactness.\nThose of you who have been unwise and have transgressed should read and pray about the section on repentance. This is also very important, so I will quote a few statements from this section.\n\u201cSome people knowingly break God\u2019s commandments. They plan to repent before they go on a mission or receive the sacred covenants and ordinances of the temple. Repentance for such behavior is difficult and painful and may take a long time. It is better to not commit the sin. Certain sins are of such gravity that they can put your membership in the Church and your eternal life at risk. Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness.\n\u201cWhere choices have already led to sexual impurity, repentance is the way back. Talk to your parents and your bishop. They love you and will explain to you how to repent and put your life in order again. Follow their counsel.\n\u201cThe miracle of forgiveness is real, and true repentance is accepted by the Lord. Full repentance of some sins requires that we not only confess and resolve them with the Lord but that we also do so with the Church. The bishop and stake president have been appointed by revelation to serve as judges in these cases.\n\u201cOnly the Lord can forgive sins, but these priesthood leaders can assist the transgressor in the process of repentance. \u2026 If you have sinned, the sooner you begin to make your way back, the sooner you will find the sweet peace and joy that come with the miracle of forgiveness.\nStake and mission presidents and bishops and branch presidents recently received instructions from the First Presidency on recommending worthy and qualified members for full-time missionary service. Brethren, we expect that you will teach youth leaders, parents, and the youth these long-established principles. Missionaries must be morally clean and spiritually prepared by you to serve the Lord in today\u2019s world. I urge you to follow the instructions precisely and to do all in your power to help young people avoid any sin that could disqualify them for service in the kingdom of God.\nNow,my dear young friends, I encourage you to take time each week to be by yourself, away from television and the crowd. Have your scriptures with you and as you read, ponder, and pray, take an honest look at your life. Evaluate where you stand with the promises you have made with Heavenly Father. If you have a problem, talk it over with the Lord in earnest and humble prayer. Counsel with your parents; they will help you. Your bishop and your Young Men and Young Women adult leaders will help. They love you and want you to be at peace with yourself so you can partake of the sacrament worthily each week. When all is said and done, however, only you know if you are living true to your covenants made with God.\nYou will be grateful, when the day comes for you to attend the temple, that you followed the counsel of the Lord and chose to be morally clean. May God bless each of you young men and women with a pure heart and a sincere desire to serve the Lord worthily.\nI know this Church is true. I know God lives and Jesus is the Christ. I know that if you, the youth of the Church, will have the courage to keep your covenants and follow the counsel of your parents and Church leaders, you will have the desire and the strength to live worthy lives. You then will be prepared for your responsibilities in your homes, in the Church, and in your communities and will be prepared to return to your Heavenly Father. May God bless every one of our precious youth, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nM. Russell Ballard\nKeeping Covenants\n1993\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "In March of 1839, from the bleak dungeon that was Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith counseled the Church, \u201cThere are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men \u2026 and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it\u201d (D&C 123:12).\nYears later, at the age of 15, the Prophet\u2019s nephew Joseph F. Smith was called to serve a mission in Hawaii. You will remember that he was only five when his father, Hyrum, was martyred. His mother, Mary Fielding, died when he was just 13. Upon arriving on the island of Maui, young Joseph fell gravely ill. Despite these and other adversities, he wrote to Elder George A. Smith: \u201cI am ready to bear my testimony \u2026 at any time, or at any place, or in whatsoever circumstances I may be placed. \u2026 I am ready to go through thick and thin for this cause in which I am engaged\u201d (as quoted in Joseph Fielding Smith, comp., Life of Joseph F. Smith [1938], 176).\nToday we must ask ourselves: Are we ready and willing to go through thick and thin for the cause in which we are engaged? Do we reflect in our countenances the joy of living the gospel of Christ as true disciples should? If we do not understand and willingly teach others of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who will? We cannot place the burden of taking the gospel to all people solely on the backs of the full-time missionaries. Families will not be fortified nor will individual testimonies be strengthened, convert baptisms will not be increased, neither will the less active be welcomed back until we as members of the Church arise individually and collectively, with dedication and action, to help build the kingdom of God.\nOur duty lies in assisting others, through the power of the Spirit, to know and understand the doctrines and principles of the gospel. Everyone must come to feel that the doctrines of the Restoration are true and of great value. And everyone who accepts the message must strive to live the gospel by making and keeping sacred covenants and by participating in all of the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. We often think of conversion as applying only to investigators, but there are some members who are not yet fully converted and who have yet to experience the mighty change of heart described in the scriptures (see Alma 5:12).\nBrethren and sisters, true and complete conversion is the key to accelerating the work of the Church.\nWe know that both members and nonmembers are more likely to be thoroughly converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ when there is a willingness to experiment upon the word (see Alma 32:27). This is an attitude of both mind and heart that includes a desire to know the truth and a willingness to act on that desire. For those investigating the Church, the experiment can be as simple as agreeing to read the Book of Mormon, to pray about it, and to earnestly seek to know if Joseph Smith was the Lord\u2019s prophet.\nTrue conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals, both members and investigators, feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord\u2019s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to feel the gospel is true.\nA most significant evidence of our conversion and of how we feel about the gospel in our own lives is our willingness to share it with others and to help missionaries find someone to teach. The likelihood of lasting conversion greatly increases when a nonmember has a friend or a relative who radiates the joy of being a member of the Church. The influence of members of the Church is very powerful. I believe that\u2019s why President Hinckley asked us to see that everyone has a friend (see \u201cConverts and Young Men,\u201d Ensign, May 1997, 47).\nHere, then, is an important key to our success in accelerating the Lord\u2019s work. As active members of the Church, and especially as priesthood and auxiliary leaders, we need to do more to assist in the process of conversion, retention, and activation. We know that faithful members desire to serve, but sometimes we lose sight of the essential outcomes that our faith and works ought to produce in strengthening the commitment of our Father\u2019s children to the gospel.\nBishops, you are the key. You give the vision and invite your ward council to help you strengthen the spiritual conversion of those investigating the Church as well as all of your members. Encourage council members to constantly think about the specific things they can do to assist you in helping your ward members and their nonmember friends to better know and understand the gospel. What can they do to help them feel it is true and to support them as they strive to live the principles? Ask yourselves what specific things we as priesthood and auxiliary leaders can do to encourage a family or an individual to experiment on the good word of God. What can the council do as leaders and teachers to ensure that every person who attends our Church meetings feels the Spirit and is strengthened spiritually?\nWe are just now learning to focus on the right things in our council meetings, but too often we still focus only on generalities. In one stake where they are having great success in baptizing and retaining new converts, the full-time missionaries are invited to meet with the ward council to discuss people they are teaching. The council members seek inspiration in determining which leaders and ward members can best help the missionaries fellowship specific individuals and families and bring them into the Church.\nSome of you bishops feel like you must be involved in every action your council members take. This is a mistake, because if you do, you will never bring all the powerful resources God has given to you into full strength. At the general Relief Society meeting two weeks ago, Sister Sheri Dew said she believes the sisters are \u201cthe Lord\u2019s secret weapon.\u201d I think she is right. Our sister leaders have a spiritual sensitivity that will prompt them how to best approach and nurture those whom the missionaries are teaching. The best place to begin to fully utilize the talents and wisdom of our sisters is through the established council system of the Church. You are free to be flexible in how you use the ward council.\nJust last year, President Hinckley said this to the bishops of the Church: \u201cYou are not bound by rigid rules. You have unlimited flexibility. You are entitled to answers to your prayers, to inspiration and revelation from the Lord\u201d (\u201cFind the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,\u201d Ensign, May 1999, 110). Perhaps in some cases, holding council meetings only once a month will not be sufficient to focus on the spiritual conversion of members and nonmembers alike who are under your ministering care. You are free to meet in council as often as deemed necessary.\nRecently a stake president shared with me a tender story demonstrating the power of the council system in building up the Church. He said that both the Relief Society and the priesthood had been working with a family in their stake but had failed to make progress with the parents. Primary leaders found the answer. Permission was given by the parents for their young daughter to attend Primary. Their one condition was that she had to want to go badly enough to get there on her own. Rides to church could not be provided. Because she had to go through a rough part of town, the ward council saw to it that someone would drive along beside her as she rode an old bicycle to church. Through summer heat, through rain and even snow, she persisted in going to church. One young man, who with his family was assigned to escort her on a snowy morning, was so touched as he watched the commitment of this little girl pedaling through the snow and cold that he decided to serve a full-time mission, citing this experience as the turning point in his life. At Christmastime, a family in the ward gave this faithful little girl a new 10-speed bicycle. This so touched the parents that they too began attending church. In May 1999 this young girl was baptized. What made the baptism even more special was that it was performed by the newest priest in the ward, her recently activated father.\nBishops, for you to accomplish what the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve are asking, your ward council needs to capture this vision and work more closely together in doing God\u2019s great work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of His children. Imagine the power that would come if every member of the Church would reach out to help all members and investigators enjoy the companionship of the Spirit. Let all of us work harder to see that the presence of the Spirit is in all of our meetings to bring about deeper spiritual conversion. This will especially require ward councils to assist the bishoprics in improving reverence in our sacrament meetings and in better teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of our church meetings.\nAll of us should constantly think about the Savior giving His life for us. We must never forget that He suffered rejection, humiliation, unspeakable agony, and eventually death in order to save you and me and the whole world from sin. Can any one of us go before Him in some future day and say that we didn\u2019t share the gospel with others and help others come to the missionaries because we were too busy or too shy, or for any other reason?\nThis is God\u2019s work. He wants us to participate with Him and His Beloved Son in bringing the gospel into the lives of all of His children. The Lord has promised us that our joy will be great if we bring just one soul unto Him (see D&C 18:15\u201316). Let us exercise greater faith and work together, members and missionaries, to bring many more souls unto Him. Let every family in the Church include as part of their daily family prayers a plea with the Lord to go before your family members and help them to find someone prepared to receive the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\nNow is the time for members of the Church to be more bold in reaching out to others, helping them to know the Church is true. Now is the time to sustain by our actions what President Gordon B. Hinckley is asking us to do.\nLucifer is unleashing vulgar, revolting, violent, and sleazy filth with the design to destroy the spiritual sensitivity of our Father\u2019s children. We truly are at war with those who mock God and shun the truth, so let us keep our covenants and heed our call to service. Let us marshal all of the Lord\u2019s resources, including the power of our own testimonies. Let them be heard by many more people. Let the spirit of President Joseph F. Smith be in our hearts. Let us say, \u201cI am ready to bear my testimony \u2026 at any time, or at any place, or in whatsoever circumstance I may be placed.\u201d It will help us to do this by reading often the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s own story and then sharing with others our own sure knowledge that the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored once again to the earth. We must move forward with the promise that the Spirit will bless us to know what to do and what to say as we assist those who are seeking to know the truth. Let us go forward with more faith, never forgetting that the Lord will help us as we turn to Him in mighty prayer. Our Heavenly Father lives and loves each of His children. The Lord Jesus Christ lives. The most important work we can do is to help God\u2019s children come to a full understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This I know to be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nM. Russell Ballard\nNow Is the Time\n2000\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Recently I was blessed to meet with a most impressive group of youth from the state of Idaho. One virtuous young woman asked me what I feel is the most important thing they should be doing in their lives right now. I suggested they learn to recognize the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in their lives. Today I expound on one aspect of that power, which is the personal strength we can receive through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nIn the Book of Mormon we read of Ammon and his brethren teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to a people who were \u201ca wild and a hardened and a ferocious people.\u201d1 Many of the people were converted and chose to leave behind their sinful behavior. So complete was their conversion that they buried their weapons and covenanted with the Lord that they would never use them again.2\nLater, many of their unconverted brethren came upon them and began to slay them. The now-faithful people chose to succumb to the sword rather than risk their spiritual lives by taking up arms. Their righteous example helped even more people to be converted and to lay down their weapons of rebellion.3\nThrough Ammon, the Lord guided them to refuge among the Nephites, and they became known as the people of Ammon.4 The Nephites protected them for many years, but eventually the Nephite army began to wear down, and reinforcements were gravely needed.5\nThe people of Ammon were at a critical moment of their spiritual lives. They had been true to their covenant never to take up arms. But they understood that fathers are responsible to provide protection to their families.6 That need seemed great enough to merit consideration of breaking their covenant.7\nTheir wise priesthood leader, Helaman, knew that breaking a covenant with the Lord is never justified. He offered an inspired alternative. He reminded them that their sons had never been guilty of the same sins and therefore had not needed to make the same covenant.8 Though the sons were very young, they were physically strong and, more important, they were virtuous and pure. The sons were fortified by the faith of their mothers.9 Under the direction of their prophet-leader, these young men took their fathers\u2019 place in defense of their families and homes.10\nThe events surrounding this critical decision demonstrate how the Atonement of Jesus Christ brings personal strength to the lives of the children of God. Consider the tender feelings of those fathers. How must they have felt to know that the rebellious actions of their past prevented them from protecting their wives and children at that moment of need? Knowing personally of the atrocities their sons would now face, they must have privately wept. Fathers, not children, are supposed to protect their families!11 Their sorrows must have been intense.\nWhy would their inspired priesthood leader fear their consideration to retrieve their weapons, \u201clest \u2026 they should lose their souls\u201d?12 The Lord has declared, \u201cBehold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.\u201d13 These faithful fathers had long since repented of their sins and become clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, so why were they counseled not to defend their families?\nIt is a fundamental truth that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can be cleansed. We can become virtuous and pure. However, sometimes our poor choices leave us with long-term consequences. One of the vital steps to complete repentance is to bear the short- and long-term consequences of our past sins. Their past choices had exposed these Ammonite fathers to a carnal appetite that could again become a point of vulnerability that Satan would attempt to exploit.\nSatan will try to use our memory of any previous guilt to lure us back into his influence. We must be ever vigilant to avoid his enticements. Such was the case of the faithful Ammonite fathers. Even after their years of faithful living, it was imperative for them to protect themselves spiritually from any attraction to the memory of past sins.\nIn between the many battles, Captain Moroni directed fortification of the weakest cities. \u201cHe caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers \u2026 until they had encircled the city \u2026 with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.\u201d14 Captain Moroni understood the importance of fortifying the weak areas to create strength.15\nThese Ammonite fathers were much the same. They needed taller and wider fortifications between their faithful lives and the unrighteous behavior of their past. Their sons, who were blessed with righteous traditions, were not as vulnerable to the same temptations. They were able to defend their families faithfully without compromising their spiritual well-being.\nThe joyful news for anyone who desires to be rid of the consequences of past poor choices is that the Lord sees weaknesses differently than He does rebellion. Whereas the Lord warns that unrepented rebellion will bring punishment,16 when the Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.17\nUndoubtedly, there is some allowance that the Ammonite fathers were taught the false traditions of their parents, but all of Father in Heaven\u2019s children come to mortality with the Light of Christ. Regardless of the cause of their sinful deeds, the effect was the development of a spiritual vulnerability that Satan would attempt to exploit.\nMercifully, they were taught the gospel, repented, and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ became spiritually much stronger than Satan\u2019s enticements. It is likely they had not felt the temptation to return to their brutal past, yet by following their prophet-leader, they didn\u2019t give Satan the chance to \u201c[cheat] their souls, and [to lead] them away carefully down to hell.\u201d18 The Savior\u2019s Atonement not only cleansed them from sin, but because of their obedience to the counsel of their priesthood leader, the Savior was able to protect them from their weaknesses and strengthen them. Their humble, lifelong commitment to forsaking their sins did more to protect their families than anything they could have done on the battlefield. Their submission did not deprive them of blessings. It strengthened them and blessed them and blessed future generations.\nThe end of the story illuminates how the mercy of the Lord made \u201cweak things become strong.\u201d19 These faithful fathers sent their sons off under the care of Helaman. Though the sons fought in fierce battles where all received at least some injury, not one life was lost.20 The young men proved to be a vital boost to the weary Nephite army. They were faithful and spiritually stronger when they returned home. Their families were blessed, protected, and strengthened.21 In our day, countless students of the Book of Mormon have been edified by the example of these pure and righteous sons.\nEach of us has had times in our lives when we have made poor choices. We are all in desperate need of the redemptive power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Each of us must repent of any rebellion. \u201cFor I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\u201d22 He cannot because He knows what it takes to become like Him.\nMany of us have allowed weakness to develop in our character. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we, like the Ammonites, can build spiritual fortifications between ourselves and any past mistakes that Satan attempts to exploit. The spiritual protections built around the Ammonite fathers blessed and strengthened themselves, their families, their country, and future generations. The same can be true with us.\nSo how do we build these eternal fortifications? The first step must be sincere, thorough, and complete repentance. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, each of us can become clean and the burden of our rebellion will be lifted. Remember, repentance is not punishment. It is the hope-filled path to a more glorious future.\nFather in Heaven has provided us tools that help to build the fortifications between our vulnerabilities and our faithfulness. Consider the following suggestions:\nMake covenants and receive ordinances for yourself. Then steadily and consistently work to provide ordinances in the temple for your own ancestors.\nShare the gospel with nonmember or less-active family members or friends. Sharing these truths can bring a renewed enthusiasm into your life.\nServe faithfully in all Church callings, especially home teaching and visiting teaching assignments. Don\u2019t be just a 15-minutes-a-month home or visiting teacher. Rather, reach out to each individual member of the family. Get to know them personally. Be a real friend. Through acts of kindness, show them how very much you care for each of them.\nMost important, serve the members of your own family. Make the spiritual development of your spouse and children a very high priority. Be attentive to the things you can do to help each one. Give freely of your time and attention.\nIn each of these suggestions, there is a common theme: fill your life with service to others. As you lose your life in the service of Father in Heaven\u2019s children,23 Satan\u2019s temptations lose power in your life.\nBecause your Father in Heaven loves you profoundly, the Atonement of Jesus Christ makes that strength possible. Isn\u2019t it wonderful? Many of you have felt the burden of poor choices, and each of you can feel the elevating power of the Lord\u2019s forgiveness, mercy, and strength. I have felt it, and I testify that it is available to each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Richard\u00a0G. Scott\nPersonal Strength through the Atonement of Jesus Christ\n2013\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, I have in mind saying a few things about what it takes to become a disciple of Jesus Christ. And this being a priesthood meeting, I presume that each of us holds the priesthood and desires to qualify as a disciple of Christ. On this premise I have chosen as my text the fifth verse of the forty-first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which reads:\n\u201cHe that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out from among you.\u201d [D&C 41:5]\nChrist\u2019s invitation to become his disciple is universal. He extends it to everyone. His call and promise is \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d (Matt. 11:28).\nAnd he has said \u201cthat every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am\u201d (D&C 93:1).\nJesus put no money price tag on his invitation. Nephi quotes him as saying, \u201cCome unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price\u201d (2 Ne. 26:25).\nThis does not mean, however, that because he put no money price on it that there is no cost involved. There is a cost to be paid in becoming a disciple of Christ, a very real cost. But the cost is a performance cost, not a money price.\nJesus taught this very plainly. He further taught that those who profess to follow him should realize the cost at the outset.\nHere are some examples. In the Gospel according to Luke he said:\n\u201cIt came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.\n\u201cAnd Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\n\u201cAnd he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.\n\u201cJesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\n\u201cAnd another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.\n\u201cAnd Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\u201d (Luke 9:57\u201362.)\nJesus was not looking for, or calling, men to do lip service only. He a wanted them to realize that following him meant effort and sacrifice. Luke tells us of an occasion when \u201cthere went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,\n\u201cIf any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\n\u201cAnd whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.\n\u201cSo likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\u201d (Luke 14:25\u201327, 33.)\nIn these seemingly harsh statements, Jesus was not specifying \u201cliteral hatred toward one\u2019s family \u2026 as a condition of discipleship.\u201d He was emphasizing \u201cthe preeminence of duty toward God over personal\u201d or worldly demands of those who would be his disciples. (James E. Talmage, Jesus the Christ, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1976, p. 453.)\nAs to counting the cost, Jesus pointed out the wisdom of doing so even with respect to mundane projects:\n\u201cWhich of you,\u201d he said, \u201cintending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\n\u201cLest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,\n\u201cSaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.\u201d (Luke 14:28\u201330.)\nIn this last dispensation, the Lord has taught the importance of complete dedication to his service and strict obedience to his commandments as emphatically as he did during his earthly ministry. For example, in 1831, the first year after the Church was organized, the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was visiting the Saints then assembled in Jackson County, Missouri, that they were in \u201cthe land of promise, \u2026 the place for the city of Zion\u201d (D&C 57:2). This good news heightened the enthusiasm of the Saints, who were already eagerly anticipating the blessings of Zion as it would be in its glory.\nAt this juncture, to calm them down a little and impress upon them the fact that the establishment of Zion would depend upon their obedience to his law, the Lord said to them:\n\u201cHearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which I have sent you.\n\u201cFor verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.\n\u201cFor after much tribulation come the blessings. \u2026\n\u201cRemember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart.\u201d (D&C 58:1\u20132, 4\u20135; italics added.)\nThe Lord was reminding the Saints there that there was some tribulation ahead before they could enjoy the promised blessings of Zion as it will be in its glory.\nHe was warning them that in Jackson County, Missouri\u2014which was Zion then and will yet be Zion\u2014where they were going, the law\u2014that is, his law\u2014had to be kept. Men had to be true disciples. This was clear notice to the Saints in Missouri, and it should and must be clear notice to us, that keeping the law of God is the principal thing that all who truly become his disciples must learn.\nA week later, just before the Prophet left Missouri for Kirtland, the Lord gave through him a revelation in which he emphasized the importance of complete and total dedication:\n\u201cBehold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with an eye single to my glory, \u2026 \n\u201cFor those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from all their labors. \u2026\n\u201cYea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth. \u2026\n\u201cAnd they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, \u2026 they that are faithful and diligent before me.\n\u201cWherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.\u201d (D&C 59:1\u20135; italics added.) Confessing and accepting is not sufficient.\nThen he named some specific things that these Saints had to learn to do before they prospered in Zion:\n\u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.\n\u201cThou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.\n\u201cThou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.\n\u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\u201d (D&C 59:6\u20139.)\nThese are some of the specific things the Lord told the Missouri Saints to do in order to prove themselves to be his disciples when he first took them to Jackson County, Missouri, the center stake of Zion.\nHis concluding instruction was: \u201cLearn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come\u201d (D&C 59:23).\nThis is not the occasion to review the history of the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri. Suffice it to say that they did not demonstrate the necessary dedication and commitment to establish Zion at that time. On February 24, 1834, after they had been \u201cdriven and smitten by the hands of [their] enemies\u201d (D&C 103:2), the Lord told the Prophet Joseph that the reason he had permitted their expulsion was so \u201cthat those who call themselves after my name might be chastened for a little season with a sore and grievous chastisement, because they did not hearken altogether unto the precepts and commandments which I gave unto them\u201d (D&C 103:4; italics added). They were not yet his disciples in the true sense of the term. He did, however, give them this great promise:\n\u201cThey shall \u2026 begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very hour.\n\u201cAnd by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.\u201d (D&C 103:6\u20137.)\nThat\u2019s our great promise. We will never cease to prevail until the Lord establishes his Zion in this world. The true discipleship of the priesthood of God will determine how fast we move toward that great consummation as we, through living the gospel, fight the debauchery and the wickedness that\u2019s going on in this world.\nAnd then the Lord said, \u201cLet no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall find it again\u201d (D&C 103:27).\nAnd this is a shocking statement to me: \u201cAnd whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my disciple\u201d (D&C 103:28).\nAs we contemplate this great declaration, it may be well for us to be reminded of the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood, by which all of us who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood are bound. Following a discussion of the \u201cHoly Priesthood\u201d (D&C 84:6) and the \u201clesser priesthood\u201d (D&C 84:30), the revelation which gives the oath and covenant of the priesthood continues:\n\u201cWhoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods [the greater priesthood and the lesser priesthood\u2014meaning, of course, the Melchizedek and the Aaronic] of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.\n\u201cThey become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.\n\u201cAnd also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord:\n\u201cFor he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;\n\u201cAnd he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;\n\u201cAnd he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father\u2019s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.\n\u201cAnd this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.\n\u201cTherefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.\u201d\nAnd then this warning:\n\u201cBut whoso breaketh this covenant [of the priesthood] after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.\u201d (D&C 84:33\u201341.)\nI hope and pray that each of us will remember and perform our obligations under the foregoing covenant and qualify for the blessing promised in the following declaration:\n\u201cVerily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul\u201d\u2014this is said of all of us here tonight\u2014that every soul \u201cwho forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am\u201d (D&C 93:1).\nNow, my brethren, I want to leave with you my witness. I know that God lives, and I am striving with all my soul to know God himself. I do not remember the time when I had any question about the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know as I live that Jesus lives, that he was and is the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, and that he is our Redeemer.\nI know that Joseph Smith opened this last dispensation. It is thrilling to me to contemplate the fact that the Father and the Son stood before Joseph in the grove and that the Father gave the Prophet a personal introduction to his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. I know that angels came and restored the priesthood to the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery; that God did establish again his church upon the earth; that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is his church; that Jesus Christ is the only name given under heaven whereby men can be saved; that acceptance and obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which we have the honor to preach and are commissioned to carry to all the ends of the earth, is the only means of salvation for this world, both temporally and spiritually.\nI shall not know these things better in the not-too-distant future when I shall stand before the Lord to give an account of my work in mortality. As I bear you this testimony I pray that we shall all fully live the gospel and thereby qualify as true disciples of Christ, to obtain the promised peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come. This I do in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nMarion G.

Our capability to recognize good is weakened.\nAs the Lord says in section 93: \u201cAnd that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience.\u201d (D&C 93:39.)\nAristotle said that wicked men obey because of fear and that good men obey because of love.

Petersen stated, \u201cOur whole religion is based upon the fact of immortality. Men have come back from the dead to accomplish the restoration of the gospel. Even God himself came.\n\u201cFirst came the Father, and Jesus Christ, his beloved Son. They visited Joseph Smith in the sacred grove near Palmyra, New York. They talked with him face-to-face and answered his questions.\n\u201cMoroni also came, repeatedly, visiting with and instructing the young prophet. Then came John the Baptist of New Testament times. Peter, James, and John were next. Moses came also to the Kirtland Temple. And then came Elijah. \u2026\n\u201cEach one was himself physical evidence of the fact of immortality, but each one brought more than the proof of life after death. Each one came with a great purpose\u2014far beyond the proof of immortality. The Father and Son opened this dispensation and provided the knowledge of the true nature of God\u2014that he is a person and that man was made in his image.\u201d\nThe Father introduced Christ to Joseph as his Only Begotten Son. They restored the knowledge of the true nature of God.\n\u201cMoroni revealed the location of the Book of Mormon. John the Baptist brought the Aaronic Priesthood. Peter, James, and John brought the Melchizedek Priesthood. Moses brought the keys of the gathering of the Jews to Palestine and the gathering of Ephraim and Manasseh.\u201d And Elijah \u2026 what did he bring? The sealing power. (\u201cThe Mission of Elijah,\u201d unpublished address to the Genealogical Department, n.d.)\nWhat is the sealing power for? It is to enable the family to be together after this life. Who wants the family unit to end at death? Our happiness and joy is in our families. But how do we get this major blessing? Obedience\u2014obedience to the requirements of the restored church of Jesus Christ.\nIn the Brazil S\u00e3o Paulo South Mission there was an Elder Malheiros who entered into the field not being able to read or write very proficiently. He was even a little fearful of giving a prayer in public. But this young man, according to his mission president, Wilford Cardon, became one of the very greatest missionaries imaginable. The president asked him toward the end of his mission how he had turned into such a dynamic, very successful missionary. (He had baptized more than two hundred people and had baptized every week for fifty-two consecutive weeks.) In a very humble manner Elder Malheiros answered, \u201cWell, president, I never doubted you. You said one could baptize every week, so I knew I could baptize every week. I never doubted. It was not always easy, but I tried to obey.\u201d\nWhy was Brother Saraiva, the president of the Guaratingat\u00e1 Branch, successful as a missionary? He heard Elder Gordon B. Hinckley at a stake conference in Brazil, in which Elder Hinckley challenged the people to bring one hundred people into the Church that year. And so Brother Saraiva said, \u201cWhy not? If a member of the Twelve says it can be done, I will obey.\u201d The last time I spoke with Brother Saraiva, he had baptized more than two hundred fifty people.\nWhy is Floriano Oliveira, a member of the high council in a stake in Brazil, so successful as a missionary? Because he obeyed the Lord\u2019s counsel to open his mouth and share the gospel. One day as he was driving through the congested traffic of S\u00e3o Paulo he took his eyes off the road for but a second and crashed into the car in front of him. He jumped out of the vehicle, hurried up to the car he had hit, opened the door and said, \u201cI am so sorry I hit you. It was all my fault. I accept the full blame and will pay the total costs. I had no intention to do this, so please forgive me. Yet if I hadn\u2019t hit you, you wouldn\u2019t have received this message I have for you, the message that you have waited for all your life.\u201d He then explained the restoration of the gospel to this man, who was a medical doctor, and the man joined the Church two weeks later. Why has Brother Oliveira had so much success in baptizing more than two hundred people? Obedience\u2014obedience to the request of the Lord.\nIn Alma 57 we read about the 2,060 sons of Helaman who fought valiantly in many wars, administering death to all who opposed them and the Church. Yet not one lost his life because they knew \u201cthat if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.\u201d (Alma 56:47.)\nIn Alma 57:21 we read: \u201cYea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness.\u201d (Italics added.) They were totally obedient. Hence, they had unbelievable protection and success.\nLet us for a moment look at some examples of disobedience, even men who had righteous intent but nevertheless disobeyed. One example would be Uzza in 1 Chr. 13:7\u201310. The people had been warned not to touch the ark, the symbol of the covenant. But when the oxen stumbled and the ark appeared to be falling, Uzza stretched forth his hand to steady it and was immediately killed by the Lord. Uzza seemed justified and today we think his punishment was very severe, but as President David O. McKay stated, this incident conveys a lesson of life: obedience\u2014full obedience.\nMay I give an example of one great man, chosen of God, who showed some disobedience and lost everything of importance: King Saul.\nThe Lord gave Saul a particular assignment: Destroy the people of Amalek! \u201cNow go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\u201d (1 Sam. 15:3.) It was a mighty army that Saul took to destroy the Amalekites\u2014210,000 men.\n\u201cBut Saul and the people spared [King] Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them.\u201d (1 Sam. 15:9.)\nSaul failed. Angered by this disobedience, the Lord sent Samuel again to upbraid the king.\n\u201cSamuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?\n\u201cAnd Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\n\u201cAnd Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice. \u2026 \n\u201cBecause thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.\u201d (1 Sam. 15:14\u201315, 22\u201323; italics added.)\nToday President Kimball is the Lord\u2019s mouthpiece on the earth, and when he says we should do certain things, even small things, what is our answer? For example, if he says clean up your yard\u2014do it. If he says paint your fence\u2014do it. If he says one more endowment per person per year\u2014do it. If he says at least one more couple per ward in the mission field\u2014do it. If he says to avoid commercial purchases whenever possible on Sunday\u2014do it. What blessings we must impede through lack of full obedience!\nNow, why obey? In Deuteronomy it states, \u201cThou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day.\u201d Now, why: \u201cthat it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.\u201d (Deut. 4:40.)\nAnd again in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 98: \u201cAnd again I say unto you, if ye observe to do whatsoever I command you, I, the Lord, will turn away all wrath and indignation from you, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.\u201d (D&C 98:22.)\nLet\u2019s just cite one more example where the Lord watched over and protected his Saints in the Church. This is found in the History of the Church: There were threats of a mob on June 19, 1834. As the Mormons were making camp, five men rode up and told them that they would \u201csee hell before morning.\u201d They stated that an armed force from Richmond, Ray, and Clay counties was to join a Jackson County force at the Fishing River ford, bent on the utter destruction of the camp.\nWhile these five men were in the camp, cursing and swearing vengeance, signs of an approaching storm were seen. No sooner had these men left the camp than the storm burst forth in all its fury. Hailstones struck, so large that they cut limbs from the trees, and the limbs fell all around the camp while the trees were twisted from their roots by the force of the wind. The earth trembled and quaked, and the streams became raging torrents, and the mobbers dispersed, seeking shelter that could not be found. One mobber was killed by lightning and another had his hand torn off by a fractious horse, and in fear they dispersed, saying that if that was the way God fought for the \u201cMormons\u201d they would go about their business.\nOn the morning of June 21 (just two days later) Colonel Sconce, with two companions, visited the camp to learn what the intentions of the members were. He said: \u201cI see there is an almighty power that protects this people, for I started from Richmond, Ray County, with a company of armed men, having a fixed determination to destroy you, but was kept back by the storm.\u201d\nThe Prophet then related to these men the sufferings of the Saints, and they left the camp offering to use their influence. (See History of the Church, 2:103\u20136.)\nDuring all this storm the members of the camp were protected from its fury. Why were they protected? Because of their collective obedience to the Lord.\nLet this be our decision: \u201cSpeak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.\u201d (Deut. 5:27.)\nMy true feelings about the Church are that I know in a definite, decisive, indelible manner that Jesus is our Redeemer. He lives, as does the Father, and President Kimball is the living servant of the living God. Let us watch the prophet, listen to him, follow him, and we will never go astray. This is the only true church of Jesus Christ upon the face of the earth, to which I testify in the name of our Redeemer, amen.\nTeddy E. Brewerton\nObedience\u2014Full Obedience\n1981\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "It is a privilege for me to speak to you today. When I was asked to do this, I asked myself, \u201cWhy me?\u201d I felt kind of scared. Then in my seminary class a girl gave a thought for opening devotional. She asked, \u201cDo you find difficulties in opportunities or opportunities in difficulties?\u201d I thought about this, and now I\u2019m here!\nI moved from Samoa to the United States last summer. I didn\u2019t want to leave my island and my friends. Going to a new high school made me very nervous. In spite of being new, I tried out for the girls\u2019 basketball team. I made it! I love basketball! As you\u2019re running down that court, everyone is counting on you to make that basket. When you make it, a feeling of happiness comes to you, and if you don\u2019t make it\u2014well, that is a whole different story!\nAnyway, I was on the team and couldn\u2019t go to seminary because I had practice every day after school, and I had seminary after school as well. I missed seminary for the whole second quarter and forgot all about it.\nOne day my mom asked me about it. I told her that everything was OK. But she knew what was going on. My seminary teacher had sent her a letter. She told me: \u201cFono, you know that what you are doing is wrong. I\u2019m just going to advise you, but it is your decision. Remember, your decision can give you happiness, and it can also put you into a lot of misery.\u201d\nI thought about this for several weeks and came to my final decision. I decided to quit basketball and go to seminary. I knew that if I chose basketball over seminary it would be pretty sad and embarrassing at seminary graduation. I didn\u2019t want to watch others graduate when I couldn\u2019t. Maybe that was the misery my mom was talking about. I decided that I should get my priorities straight. Even though I love basketball so much, first things first. I am hoping to make the basketball team next year. As I plan my schedule, I am making sure that I won\u2019t have to drop seminary again in order to practice.\nRight now I\u2019m back in seminary. I have a great teacher, a fun class, and I\u2019m very proud of myself for making the right decision. This experience reminds me of a scripture found in Matthew 6:33 [Matt. 6:33]: \u201cBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d\nIn my native language, I would like to bear my testimony. [Sister Lavatai then spoke the italicized text in Samoan.] I know this Church is true. Its doctrines are true. I am grateful for this Young Women program, for it has taught us many things to improve our lives.\nI know this gospel is true. It has helped me a lot throughout my life.

The financial statements and operations reviewed by the committee include the general funds of the Church and of other controlled organizations, the accounts of which are maintained by the Financial Department of the Church. We have also examined the budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures employed, and the manner in which funds received and expenditures are controlled. We determined that expenditures of general Church funds were authorized by the First Presidency and by budgetary procedures. The budget is authorized by the Council on Disposition of the Tithes comprised of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. The Committee on Expenditures, in weekly meetings, administers the expenditure of funds under the budget.\nModern accounting technology and equipment are employed by the Financial and other departments in keeping abreast of rapid Church expansion and changing methods of electronic data processing. The Committee and the Law Department are conjointly giving continuous attention to matters relating to taxation of churches by the federal government, the states, and by foreign governments.\nThe Auditing Department, which is independent of all other departments, is engaged on a continuous basis in performing operational as well as financial audits of all Church departments and other Church-controlled organizations, the accounts of which are maintained in the Financial Department. These services also include the missions, financial centers, and departmental activities conducted in foreign countries. The Auditing Department is also responsible for conducting audits of the computer systems employed by the Church. The extent and scope of its operations in safeguarding the resources of the Church are increasing commensurate with the growth and widening activities of the Church. The audit of local funds of wards and stakes is assigned to stake auditors. Incorporated businesses, owned or controlled by the Church, for which accounts are not maintained in the Financial Department, are audited by professional auditing firms or by governmental regulatory agencies.\nBased on our review of the annual financial report and other accounting data, and our study of the accounting and auditing methods by which financial operations are controlled, together with continuing discussions with personnel of the Financial, Auditing, and Law departments, we are of the opinion that the general funds of the Church, received and expended during the year 1977, have been properly accounted for in accordance with established procedures as outlined herein.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCHURCH FINANCE COMMITTEE\nWarren E.

You courageously look to the Savior. You are faithful, obedient, and pure. The blessings you receive because of your goodness affect not only your lives but also my life and the lives of countless others in profound but often unknown ways.\nA few years ago, I was in line to make a purchase at my local grocery store. Ahead of me stood a young woman, about 15 years old. She appeared confident and happy. I noticed her T-shirt and couldn\u2019t resist talking to her. I began, \u201cYou\u2019re from out of state, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe was surprised by my question and replied, \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019m from Colorado. How did you know?\u201d\nI explained, \u201cBecause of your T-shirt.\u201d I made my accurate supposition after reading the words on her shirt, \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon. Are you?\u201d\nI continued, \u201cI must tell you that I\u2019m impressed by your confidence to stand out and wear such a bold declaration. I see a difference in you, and I wish every young woman and every member of the Church could have your same conviction and confidence.\u201d Our purchases completed, we said good-bye and parted.\nYet for days and weeks after this random everyday moment, I found myself seriously reflecting upon this encounter. I wondered how this young girl from Colorado came to possess such confidence in her identity as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what meaningful phrase I would figuratively choose to have printed on my T-shirt reflecting my belief and testimony. In my mind, I considered many possible sayings. Eventually, I came upon an ideal statement I would proudly wear: \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon. I know it. I live it. I love it.\u201d\nToday I\u2019d like to focus my remarks around this bold, hopeful statement.\nThe first part of the statement is a self-assured, unapologetic declaration: \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon.\u201d Just as the young woman I met in the grocery store was not afraid to let the world know she was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I hope we will never be afraid or reluctant to acknowledge, \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon.\u201d We should be confident, as was the Apostle Paul when he proclaimed, \u201cFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.\u201d1 As members, we are followers of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Such conversion and confidence is the result of diligent and deliberate effort. It is individual. It is the process of a lifetime.\nThe next part of the statement affirms, \u201cI know it.\u201d In today\u2019s world, there are a multitude of activities, subjects, and interests vying for every minute of our attention. With so many distractions, do we have the strength, discipline, and commitment to remain focused on what matters most? Are we as well versed in gospel truths as we are in our studies, careers, hobbies, sports, or our texts and tweets? Do we actively seek to find answers to our questions by feasting on the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets? Do we seek the confirmation of the Spirit?\nThe importance of gaining knowledge is an eternal principle. The Prophet Joseph Smith \u201cloved knowledge for its righteous power.\u201d2 He said: \u201cKnowledge is necessary to life and godliness. \u2026 Hear, all ye brethren, this grand key: knowledge is the power of God unto salvation.\u201d3\nAll truth and knowledge is important, but amidst the constant distractions of our daily lives, we must especially pay attention to increasing our gospel knowledge so we can understand how to apply gospel principles to our lives.4 As our gospel knowledge increases, we will begin to feel confident in our testimonies and be able to state, \u201cI know it.\u201d\nNext is the statement, \u201cI live it.\u201d The scriptures teach that we must be \u201cdoers of the word, and not hearers only.\u201d5We live the gospel and become \u201cdoers of the word\u201d by exercising faith, being obedient, lovingly serving others, and following our Savior\u2019s example. We act with integrity and do what we know is right \u201cat all times and in all things, and in all places\u201d6 no matter who may or may not be watching.\nIn our mortal condition, no one is perfect. Even in our most diligent efforts to live the gospel, all of us will make mistakes, and all of us will sin. What a comforting assurance it is to know that through our Savior\u2019s redeeming sacrifice, we can be forgiven and made clean again. This process of true repentance and forgiveness strengthens our testimony and our resolve to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments and live our life according to gospel standards.\nWhen I think of the phrase, \u201cI live it,\u201d I am reminded of a young woman I met named Karigan. She wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the Church for a little over a year. \u2026 For me, when investigating, one sign that this was the true Church came because I felt I\u2019d finally found a church that taught modesty and standards. I\u2019ve seen with my own eyes what happens to people when they disregard commandments and choose the wrong path. I made up my mind, long ago, to live high moral standards. \u2026 I feel so blessed to have found the truth and to have been baptized. I am so happy.\u201d7\nThe final phrase in my declarative statement is \u201cI love it.\u201d Gaining a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ and diligently living gospel principles in our everyday lives leads many members of the Church to exclaim enthusiastically, \u201cI love the gospel!\u201d\nThis feeling comes as we feel the Holy Ghost witnessing to us that we are children of our Heavenly Father, He is mindful of us, and we are on the right path. Our love for the gospel grows as we experience the love of our Father in Heaven and the peace promised by the Savior as we show Him we are willing to obey and follow Him.\nAt different times in our lives, whether we are new converts to the Church or lifelong members, we may find that this vibrant enthusiasm has faded. Sometimes this happens when times are challenging and we must practice patience. Sometimes it happens at the peak of our prosperity and abundance. Whenever I have this feeling, I know I need to refocus my efforts on increasing my gospel knowledge and living gospel principles more fully in my life.\nOne of the most effective but sometimes difficult gospel principles to apply is humility and submission to the will of God. In Christ\u2019s prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, He expressed to the Father, \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done.\u201d8 This should be our prayer as well. Oftentimes, it is in these quiet, prayerful moments that we feel encircled in Heavenly Father\u2019s love and those joyful, loving feelings are restored.\nAt a Young Women leadership meeting in Eugene, Oregon, I had the privilege of meeting and talking with Sister Cammy Wilberger. The story Sister Wilberger shared with me was a witness of the power and blessing of one young woman\u2019s knowing, living, and loving the gospel.\nSister Wilberger\u2019s 19-year-old daughter, Brooke, was tragically killed several years ago while on summer break after her first year at university. Sister Wilberger recalled, \u201cIt was a difficult and dark time for our family. However, Brooke had given us a great gift. We didn\u2019t recognize this as she was growing up, but every single year and moment of her brief life, Brooke had given us the greatest gift a daughter could give her parents. Brooke was a righteous daughter of God. \u2026 Because of this gift and especially because of the enabling power of the Atonement, I have had strength, comfort, and the Savior\u2019s promised peace. I have no question where Brooke is now and look forward to our loving reunion.\u201d9\nI have a testimony of our Heavenly Father\u2019s great plan of eternal happiness. I know that He knows us and loves us. I know that He has prepared a prophet, President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson, to encourage us and help guide us back to Him. I pray that each of us will put forth the effort to be able to confidently declare, \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon. I know it. I live it. I love it.\u201d I say these things humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nNote: For further study, I recommend reading Alma 32 and Elder Dallin\u00a0H. Oaks\u2019s talk \u201cThe Challenge to Become\u201d (Liahona, Jan. 2001, 40\u201343; Ensign, Nov. 2000, 32\u201334).\nBy Ann\u00a0M. Dibb\nI Know It. I Live It. I Love It.\n2012\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "At this Easter season, I extend to all who are participating in these services my warmest greetings and prayers for your happiness and well-being. On this day we remember that the risen Lord has charged us with the responsibility to build the kingdom of God on earth. With this charge in mind, I hope to add a few thoughts that may strengthen the most important of all institutions\u2014the family.\nIn recent times, society has been plagued with a cancer from which few families have escaped. I speak of the disintegration of our homes. Immediate corrective treatment is urgent. In what I have to say, I do not wish to offend anyone. I affirm my profound belief that God\u2019s greatest creation is womanhood. I also believe that there is no greater good in all the world than motherhood. The influence of a mother in the lives of her children is beyond calculation. Single parents, most of whom are mothers, perform an especially heroic service.\nI hasten to acknowledge that there are too many husbands and fathers who are abusive to their wives and children and from whom the wives and children need protection. Yet modern sociological studies powerfully reaffirm the essential influence of a caring father in the life of a child\u2014boy or girl. In the past twenty years, as homes and families have struggled to stay intact, sociological studies reveal this alarming fact: much of the crime and many of the behavioral disorders in the United States come from homes where the father has abandoned the children. In many societies the world over, child poverty, crime, drug abuse, and family decay can be traced to conditions where the father gives no male nurturing. Sociologically, it is now painfully apparent that fathers are not optional family baggage. We need to honor the position of the father as the primary provider for physical and spiritual support. I state this with no reluctance because the Lord has revealed that this obligation is placed upon husbands. \u201cWomen have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken.\u201d (D&C 83:2.) Further, \u201cAll children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.\u201d (D&C 83:4.) In addition, their spiritual welfare should be \u201cbrought to pass by the faith and covenant of their fathers.\u201d (D&C 84:99.) As regards little children, the Lord has promised that \u201cgreat things may be required at the hands of their fathers.\u201d (D&C 29:48.)\nIt is useless to debate which parent is most important. No one would doubt that a mother\u2019s influence is paramount with newborns and in the first years of a child\u2019s life. The father\u2019s influence increases as the child grows older. However, each parent is necessary at various times in a child\u2019s development. Both fathers and mothers do many intrinsically different things for their children. Both mothers and fathers are equipped to nurture children, but their approaches are different. Mothers seem to take a dominant role in preparing children to live within their families (present and future). Fathers seem best equipped to prepare children to function in the environment outside the family.\nOne authority states: \u201cStudies show that fathers have a special role to play in building a child\u2019s self-respect. They are important, too, in ways we really don\u2019t understand, in developing internal limits and controls in children.\u201d He continues, \u201cResearch also shows that fathers are critical in establishment of gender in children. Interestingly, fatherly involvement produces stronger sexual identity and character in both boys and girls. It is well established that the masculinity of sons and the femininity of daughters are each greater when fathers are active in family life.\u201d (Karl Zinsmeister, \u201cDo Children Need Fathers?\u201d Crisis, Oct. 1992.)\nParents in any marital situation have a duty to set aside personal differences and encourage each other\u2019s righteous influence in the lives of their children.\nIs it not possible to give to woman-kind all the rights and blessings that come from God and legal authority without diminishing the nobility of God\u2019s other grand creation, manhood? Eliza R. Snow stated in 1872: \u201cThe status of women is one of the questions of the day. Socially and politically it forces itself upon the attention of the world. Some \u2026 refuse to concede that woman is entitled to the enjoyment of any rights other than \u2026 the whims, fancies or justice \u2026 men may choose to grant her. The reasons which they cannot meet with argument they decry and ridicule; an old refuge for those opposed to correct principles which they are unable to controvert. Others \u2026 not only recognize that woman\u2019s status should be improved, but are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence; and \u2026 show how entirely independent she should be.\u201d Indeed, she continued, they \u201cwould make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women. These are the two extremes, and between them is the \u2018golden mean.\u2019\u201d (The Woman\u2019s Exponent, 15 July 1872, p. 29.)\nMany people do not understand our belief that God has wisely established a guiding authority for the most important institutions in the world. This guiding authority is called the priesthood. The priesthood is held in trust to be used to bless all of God\u2019s children. Priesthood is not gender; it is blessings from God for all at the hands of the servants He has designated. Within the Church this authority of the priesthood can bless all members through the ministration of home teachers, quorum presidents, bishops, fathers, and all other righteous brethren who are charged with the administration of the affairs of the kingdom of God. Priesthood is the righteous power and influence by which boys are taught in their youth and throughout their lives to honor chastity, to be honest and industrious, and to develop respect for, and stand in the defense of, womanhood. Priesthood is a restraining influence. Girls are taught that through its influence and power to bless, they can fulfill many of their desires.\nHolding the priesthood means following the example of Christ and seeking to emulate his example of fatherhood. It means constant concern and caring for one\u2019s own flesh and blood. The man who holds the priesthood is to honor it by eternally cherishing, with absolute fidelity, his wife and the mother of his children. He is to extend lifelong care and concern for his children, and their children. The plea of David for his rebel son is one of the most moving in all of the scriptures, \u201cO my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d (2 Sam. 18:33.)\nI urge the husbands and fathers of this Church to be the kind of a man your wife would not want to be without. I urge the sisters of this Church to be patient, loving, and understanding with their husbands. Those who enter into marriage should be fully prepared to establish their marriage as the first priority in their lives.\nIt is destructive to the feeling essential for a happy marriage for either party to say to the other marriage partner, \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d This is particularly so because the counsel of the Savior was and is to become one flesh: \u201cFor this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh[.]\n\u201cWherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh\u201d (Matt. 19:5\u20136.) It is far more difficult to be of one heart and mind than to be physically one. This unity of heart and mind is manifest in sincere expressions of \u201cI appreciate you\u201d and \u201cI am proud of you.\u201d Such domestic harmony results from forgiving and forgetting, essential elements of a maturing marriage relationship. Someone has said that we should keep our eyes wide open before marriage and half shut afterward. (Magdeleine de Scud\u00e9ry, as cited in The International Dictionary of Thoughts, Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 472). True charity ought to begin in marriage, for it is a relationship that must be rebuilt every day.\nI wonder if it is possible for one marriage partner to jettison the other and become completely whole. Either partner who diminishes the divine role of the other in the presence of the children demeans the budding femininity within the daughters and the emerging manhood of the sons. I suppose there are always some honest differences between husband and wife, but let them be settled in private.\nThe importance of this subject emboldens me to say a word about covenant breaking. It must be recognized that some marriages just fail. To those in that circumstance, I extend understanding because every divorce carries heartache with it. I hope what I say will not be disturbing. In my opinion, any promise between a man and a woman incident to a marriage ceremony rises to the dignity of a covenant. The family relationship of father, mother, and child is the oldest and most enduring institution in the world. It has survived vast differences of geography and culture. This is because marriage between man and woman is a natural state and is ordained of God. It is a moral imperative. Those marriages performed in our temples, meant to be eternal relationships, then, become the most sacred covenants we can make. The sealing power given by God through Elijah is thus invoked, and God becomes a party to the promises.\nWhat, then, might be \u201cjust cause\u201d for breaking the covenants of marriage? Over a lifetime of dealing with human problems, I have struggled to understand what might be considered \u201cjust cause\u201d for breaking of covenants. I confess I do not claim the wisdom or authority to definitively state what is \u201cjust cause.\u201d Only the parties to the marriage can determine this. They must bear the responsibility for the train of consequences which inevitably follow if these covenants are not honored. In my opinion, \u201cjust cause\u201d should be nothing less serious than a prolonged and apparently irredeemable relationship which is destructive of a person\u2019s dignity as a human being.\nAt the same time, I have strong feelings about what is not provocation for breaking the sacred covenants of marriage. Surely it is not simply \u201cmental distress,\u201d nor \u201cpersonality differences,\u201d nor having \u201cgrown apart,\u201d nor having \u201cfallen out of love.\u201d This is especially so where there are children. Enduring divine counsel comes from Paul:\n\u201cHusbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.\u201d (Eph. 5:25.)\n\u201cThat they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, [and] to love their children.\u201d (Titus 2:4.)\nIn my opinion, members of the Church have the most effective cure for our decaying family life. It is for men, women, and children to honor and respect the divine roles of both fathers and mothers in the home. In so doing, mutual respect and appreciation among the members of the Church will be fostered by the righteousness found there. In this way, the great sealing keys restored by Elijah, spoken of by Malachi, might operate \u201cto turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.\u201d (D&C 110:15; see also Mal. 4:6.)\nPresident Joseph Fielding Smith stated concerning the keys of Elijah: \u201cThis sealing power bestowed upon Elijah, is the power which binds husbands and wives, and children to parents for time and eternity. It is the binding power existing in every Gospel ordinance. \u2026 It was the mission of Elijah to come, and restore it so that the curse of confusion and disorder would not exist in the kingdom of God.\u201d (Elijah the Prophet and His Mission, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957, p. 5.) Confusion and disorder are all too common in society, but they must not be permitted to destroy our homes.\nPerhaps we regard the power bestowed by Elijah as something associated only with formal ordinances performed in sacred places. But these ordinances become dynamic and productive of good only as they reveal themselves in our daily lives. Malachi said that the power of Elijah would turn the hearts of the fathers and the children to each other. The heart is the seat of the emotions and a conduit for revelation. (See Mal. 4:5\u20136.) This sealing power thus reveals itself in family relationships, in attributes and virtues developed in a nurturing environment, and in loving service. These are the cords that bind families together, and the priesthood advances their development. In imperceptible but real ways, the \u201cdoctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul [and thy home] as the dews from heaven.\u201d (D&C 121:45.)\nI so testify that the blessings of the priesthood, honored by fathers and husbands and revered by wives and children, can indeed cure the cancer that plagues our society. I plead with you, Fathers, come home. Magnify your priesthood calling; bless your families through this sacred influence, and experience the rewards promised by our Father and God. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJames E. Faust\nFather, Come Home\n1993\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Recently I watched over 20,000 young Latter-day Saint men and women listen to a spiritual message. They took notes and concentrated on the speaker, anxious to learn. There radiated from them an intense spirit of purity, righteousness, and devotion. No one had forced them to come. They wanted to be there.\nLater I met with over 2,000 full-time missionaries preparing to serve. The room was charged with the Spirit. I asked them difficult questions. They responded extremely well, often citing supporting scriptures. As I shook missionaries\u2019 hands and looked into their eyes, I felt purity and a spirit of devotion. It was an inspiring experience. Each had set aside personal interests to accept a call to join what can become our greatest generation of missionaries.\nI have had like experiences with youth across the earth. The faculty at our three universities note a significant increase in capacity and spiritual sensitivity of students. Something extraordinary is happening. Do you sense it? Truly, as obedience and morality decline in the world, the Lord is sending more exceptional spirits to earth. As a body they excel the average capacity of their forebears. Their potential for personal growth and positive contribution is enormous. As parents and leaders, how are you cultivating that potential? As a young man or woman of this generation, what are you doing to realize your extraordinary potential? Will you nurture it and rise to exceptional heights of accomplishment and happiness? How will you avoid Satan\u2019s efforts to undermine your potential through transgression? Only you can answer these critical questions.\nWith all my capacity I encourage you to discover who you really are. I invite you to look beyond the daily routine of life. I urge you to discern through the Spirit your divinely given capacities. I exhort you to prayerfully make worthy choices that will lead you to realize your full potential.\nI will share one sure way you can begin to accomplish such growth. I have seen valiant missionaries brave icy wind, resist torrential rains, slosh through slippery, muddy streets, and conquer fear. Often they bear a powerful testimony, only to be rejected and roundly criticized. I have seen them struggle to communicate truth in a new language. Sometimes the listener stares in puzzled silence. Then there dawns the shattering realization that the message is not understood. But I wouldn\u2019t change any of it, even if I could, because there are those golden moments of success that make all of the hardships worthwhile. Such rewards come when the Spirit touches a heart for eternal good because someone like you was there. To share truth in difficult circumstances is to treasure it more. When you push against the boundaries of experience into the twilight of the unknown, the Lord will strengthen you. The beauty of your eternal soul will begin to unfold.\nThe challenges are greater now than ever. That is why the Lord needs more capable, better prepared missionaries. He needs those who are clean and pure so that they can be guided by the Spirit and can testify with converting power. Qualify to be one of those exceptional missionaries. It will not be easy. But when was anything really worthwhile easy?\nThe First Presidency has defined high standards of moral worthiness and the physical, mental, and emotional stability missionary service now demands. The standards are rigorous, but you can meet them. You will rejoice in the feelings of peace and confidence that come from living them. The standards were raised not to make it harder, but because missionaries now serve in an environment where spiritual guidance is absolutely essential. Also, adjustments have been made in the presentation of the discussions. They are not now memorized; rather, the basic content is learned and given as guided by the Spirit. Personal worthiness is essential to do that (see \u201cStatement on Missionary Work\u201d attached to First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002).\nYou are of a singular generation with exceptional potential. No wonder Satan wants to cripple that potential by tempting you to violate the laws of God. He knows that he has no power over a righteous individual. Yet he is a master at making sin appealing to the undecided.\nPreparation for a mission and a meaningful life best begins in the home. As a parent, one of the greatest gifts you can give a son or daughter is to consistently nurture a growing testimony of truth, patiently nurturing each child\u2019s spiritual capacity. Carefully explain the doctrines of the Church and the power they give when well lived. That foundation will equip a child to resist evil in the world. Encourage every son that is physically and emotionally able to prepare to serve worthily a full-time mission.\nBishops and stake presidents, with priesthood and auxiliary leaders, strengthen the spiritual capacity of your youth. Do that by encouraging their participation in Church activities that fortify the teachings of parents.\nAs a young man, actively participate in your priesthood quorum. As a young woman, attend class activities and complete your Personal Progress goals. Both of you, be active in Sunday School discussions to retain what is taught. Take part in seminary and institute to gain vital understanding of truth. Don\u2019t just listen to pass a test. Incorporate what you study into your life.\nStudy the First Vision as recorded as Joseph Smith\u2014History in the Pearl of Great Price. Learn of the subsequent events that brought the full restoration of truth, with the priesthood authority and ordinances essential to exaltation. Gain your own testimony of these things. Fix them in your mind and heart.\nTry reading the Book of Mormon because you want to, not because you have to. Discover for yourself that it is true. As you read each page ask, \u201cCould any man have written this book or did it come as Joseph Smith testified?\u201d Apply the teachings you learn. They will fortify you against the evil of Satan. Follow Moroni\u2019s counsel. Sincerely ask God the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, with real intent, if the teachings of the Book of Mormon are true (see Moro. 10:3\u20135). Ask with a desire to receive a confirmation personally, nothing doubting. There has to be an explanation of that book you can hold in your hand. I know that you can receive a spiritual confirmation that it is true. You will then know that Jesus Christ lives, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord\u2019s Church (see introduction to the Book of Mormon, especially the last paragraph). You will confirm that the Savior guides His Church through a living prophet. These truths will become a foundation for your productive life.\nOne may say, \u201cI don\u2019t have all the blessings of an ideal family and full Church experience.\u201d Neither did I enjoy all of those advantages, nor did some other members of the Quorum of the Twelve. Compensate by obtaining your own unwavering testimony of truth. Obtain a personal conviction that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored to earth and that His doctrines are true. There are different paths to that treasured gift. They begin with your sincere desire to know. The flickering flame of faith can die if you do not nurture it. But that tiny flame can grow into a brilliant, unquenchable fire through sincere prayer and consistent study of the Book of Mormon and other scriptures. Such faith will be sustained as you apply the principles you learn.\nRemain worthy. When you really understand who you are, it is not difficult to resist Satan\u2019s temptations. Then he can\u2019t thwart the development of your true potential.\nAs a young man, the greatest growth and strengthening experience you can have at this time, bar none, is a worthy full-time mission. While a mission is not for personal advantage, the Lord richly blesses those who valiantly serve. Be one of the army of remarkable, well-prepared, devoted missionaries that are qualifying to the high standards of worthiness. Join those who have chosen to serve the Lord, wherever called, however challenging it may be.\nMissionary work is extremely demanding. If you have emotional challenges that can be stabilized to meet the rigors of a full-time mission, you can be called. It is vital that you continue to use your medication during your mission or until competent medical authority counsels otherwise. Recognize that emotional and physical challenges are alike. One needs to do all that is possible to improve the situation, then learn to live within the remaining bounds. God uses challenges that we may grow by conquering them.\nYour physical or emotional circumstance may be such that you have been excused by the President of the Church from full-time missionary service (see \u201cStatement on Missionary Work\u201d attached to First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). For you there are other ways to render meaningful service compatible with your condition. Your bishop or stake president can help you identify such service where you live. It could be in a Church family history center, temple, welfare project, employment center, or in a local hospital, care center, shelter, or elsewhere. There are many places where help is needed. You can live at home and contribute powerfully. Such a call can be for a few months or longer. Your stake president will come to know where you should serve and for how long. He will then issue a formal call. Whatever your call may be, study the message of the Restoration with materials full-time missionaries can provide. Then look for opportunities to share that message. As you conscientiously do that, you will be led to individuals that will be touched to learn more.\nAs I have spoken of missionary service, you may have thought, \u201cThat\u2019s not for me.\u201d I plead with you to prayerfully reconsider. All that I treasure most in life began to mature in the mission field. You can also earn such blessings.\nIf you have made bad choices, repent now. Remove any such barrier to your progress and happiness.\nYou are a precious young man or woman. Realize your full potential. Be the leader and example the Lord expects you to be. Young man, be a part of the greatest generation of missionaries. Worthy youth, prepare to receive the temple ordinances and to raise your eternal family. God loves you. I testify that as you seek His help, He will guide you to fulfill your worthy dreams, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard G. Scott\nRealize Your Full Potential\n2003\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "At the end of a particularly tiring day toward the end of my first week as a General Authority, my briefcase was overloaded and my mind was preoccupied with the question \u201cHow can I possibly do this?\u201d I left the office of the Seventy and entered the elevator of the Church Administration Building. As the elevator descended, my head was down and I stared blankly at the floor.\nThe door opened and someone entered, but I didn\u2019t look up. As the door closed, I heard someone ask, \u201cWhat are you looking at down there?\u201d I recognized that voice\u2014it was President Thomas S. Monson.\nI quickly looked up and responded, \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d (I\u2019m sure that clever response inspired confidence in my abilities!)\nBut he had seen my subdued countenance and my heavy briefcase. He smiled and lovingly suggested, while pointing heavenward, \u201cIt is better to look up!\u201d As we traveled down one more level, he cheerfully explained that he was on his way to the temple. When he bid me farewell, his parting glance spoke again to my heart, \u201cNow, remember, it is better to look up.\u201d\nAs we parted, the words of a scripture came to mind: \u201cBelieve in God; believe that he is \u2026 ; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth.\u201d1 As I thought of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ\u2019s power, my heart found the comfort I had sought in vain from the floor of that descending elevator.\nSince then I have pondered this experience and the role of prophets. I was burdened and my head was down. As the prophet spoke, I looked to him. He redirected my focus to look up to God, where I could be healed and strengthened through Christ\u2019s Atonement. That is what prophets do for us. They lead us to God.2\nI testify that President Monson is not only a prophet, seer, and revelator; he is also a wonderful example of living the principle of looking up. Of all people, he could feel weighed down by his responsibilities. Instead, he exercises great faith and is filled with optimism, wisdom, and love for others. His attitude is one of \u201ccan do\u201d and \u201cwill do.\u201d He trusts the Lord and relies on Him for strength, and the Lord blesses him.\nExperience has taught me that if we, like President Monson, exercise our faith and look to God for help, we will not be overwhelmed with the burdens of life. We will not feel incapable of doing what we are called to do or need to do. We will be strengthened, and our lives will be filled with peace and joy.3 We will come to realize that most of what we worry about is not of eternal significance\u2014and if it is, the Lord will help us. But we must have the faith to look up and the courage to follow His direction.\nWhy is it a challenge to consistently look up in our lives? Perhaps we lack the faith that such a simple act can solve our problems. For example, when the children of Israel were bitten by poisonous serpents, Moses was commanded to raise up a brass serpent on a pole. The brass serpent represented Christ. Those who looked up at the serpent, as admonished by the prophet, were healed.4 But many others failed to look up, and they perished.5\nAlma agreed that the reason the Israelites did not look to the serpent was that they did not believe doing so would heal them. Alma\u2019s words are relevant to us today:\n\u201cO my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful \u2026 ?\n\u201cIf so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for [our] sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead.\u201d6\nPresident Monson\u2019s encouragement to look up is a metaphor for remembering Christ. As we remember Him and trust in His power, we receive strength through His Atonement. It is the means whereby we can be relieved of our anxieties, our burdens, and our suffering. It is the means whereby we can be forgiven and healed from the pain of our sins. It is the means whereby we can receive the faith and strength to endure all things.7\nRecently Sister Cook and I attended a women\u2019s conference in South Africa. After we listened to some inspiring messages on applying the Atonement in our lives, the stake Relief Society president invited everyone outside. We were each given a helium balloon. She explained that our balloon represented whatever burden, trial, or hardship was holding us back in our lives. On the count of three, we released our balloons, or our \u201cburdens.\u201d As we looked up and watched our burdens float away, there was an audible \u201cAhhhh.\u201d That simple act of releasing our balloons provided a marvelous reminder of the indescribable joy that comes from looking up and thinking of Christ.\nUnlike releasing a helium balloon, spiritually looking up is not a one-time experience. We learn from the sacrament prayer that we are to always remember Him and to keep His commandments, that we may have His Spirit to be with us every day to guide us.8\nWhen the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, the Lord guided their journey each day as they looked to Him for direction. In Exodus we read, \u201cAnd the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light.\u201d9 His leading was constant, and I give you my humble witness that the Lord can do the same for us.\nSo how will He lead us today? Through prophets, apostles, and priesthood leaders and through feelings that come after we pour out our hearts and souls to Heavenly Father in prayer. He leads us as we forsake the things of the world, repent, and change. He leads us as we keep His commandments and try to be more like Him. And He leads us through the Holy Ghost.10\nIn order to be guided in life\u2019s journey and have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must have a \u201chearing ear\u201d and a \u201cseeing eye,\u201d both directed upward.11 We must act on the direction we receive. We must look up and step up. And as we do, I know we will cheer up, for God wants us to be happy.\nWe are Heavenly Father\u2019s children. He wants to be a part of our lives, to bless us, and to help us. He will heal our wounds, dry our tears, and help us along our path to return to His presence. As we look to Him, He will lead us.\nThe Lord is my light; then why should I fear?\nBy day and by night his presence is near. \u2026\nHe is my joy and my song.\nBy day and by night he leads \u2026 me along.12\nI bear testimony that sins are forgiven and burdens are lightened as we look to Christ. \u201cLet us remember him, \u2026 and not hang down our heads,\u201d13 for, as President Monson said, \u201cIt is better to look up.\u201d\nI testify that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nCarl B. Cook\nIt Is Better to Look Up\n2011\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "In 1918 Brother George Goates was a farmer who raised sugar beets in Lehi, Utah. Winter came early that year and froze much of his beet crop in the ground. For George and his young son Francis, the harvest was slow and difficult. Meanwhile, an influenza epidemic was raging. The dreaded disease claimed the lives of George\u2019s son Charles and three of Charles\u2019s small children\u2014two little girls and a boy. In the course of only six days, a grieving George Goates made three separate trips to Ogden, Utah, to bring the bodies home for burial. At the end of this terrible interlude, George and Francis hitched up their wagon and headed back to the beet field.\n\u201c[On the way] they passed wagon after wagon-load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers. As they passed by, each driver would wave a greeting: \u2018Hi ya, Uncle George,\u2019 \u2018Sure sorry, George,\u2019 \u2018Tough break, George,\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve got a lot of friends, George.\u2019\n\u201cOn the last wagon was \u2026 freckled-faced Jasper Rolfe. He waved a cheery greeting and called out: \u2018That\u2019s all of \u2018em, Uncle George.\u2019\n\u201c[Brother Goates] turned to Francis and said: \u2018I wish it was all of ours.\u2019\n\u201cWhen they arrived at the farm gate, Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as [his father] drove onto the field. [George] pulled up, stopped the team, \u2026 and scanned the field. \u2026 There wasn\u2019t a sugar beet on the whole field. Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out: \u2018That\u2019s all of \u2018em, Uncle George!\u2019\n\u201c[George] got down off the wagon, picked up a handful of the rich, brown soil he loved so much, and then \u2026 a beet top, and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor, as if he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.\n\u201cThen [he] sat down on a pile of beet tops\u2014this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days; made caskets, dug graves, and even helped with the burial clothing\u2014this amazing man who never faltered, nor flinched, nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal\u2014sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child.\n\u201cThen he arose, wiped his eyes, \u2026 looked up at the sky, and said: \u2018Thanks, Father, for the elders of our ward.\u2019\u201d1\nIt is of such elders that I wish to speak this evening. I wish to speak of brothers in the priesthood. I wish to speak of the priesthood quorum.\nPresident Boyd K. Packer has explained that \u201cin ancient days when a man was appointed to a select body, his commission, always written in Latin, outlined the responsibility of the organization, defined who should be members, and then invariably contained the words: quorum vos unum meaning, \u2018of whom we will that you be one.\u2019\u201d2\n\u201cIn the dispensation of the fulness of times, the Lord instructed that the priesthood should be organized into quorums, meaning selected assemblies of brethren given authority that His business might be transacted and His work proceed.\n\u201cA quorum is a brotherhood. \u2026 [Membership in a quorum] becomes a right of one ordained to an office in the priesthood.\u201d3\nThe scriptures establish the quorums of priesthood and their respective duties in the Church of Jesus Christ today including the First Presidency,4 the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,5 and the Quorums of the Seventy.6 The \u201cstanding ministers\u201d in the stakes of Zion are identified, the high priests and elders,7 as are the three quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood: the priests, teachers, and deacons.8\nSixty years ago Elder Stephen L Richards, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, provided a characteristically cogent statement of the function of priesthood quorums. Said he, \u201cA quorum is three things: first, a class; second, a fraternity; and third, a service unit.\u201d9 Let us examine briefly these three aspects of priesthood quorums.\nFirst, a quorum is a class. When a priesthood quorum or group meets as a class, its members can learn together, be \u201cnourished by the good word of God,\u201d10 and grow spiritually. We study so that we may better teach.11 Beginning this year, the priesthood has a curriculum program, shared in part by the Relief Society, that can revitalize quorums and make them \u201cschool[s] of the prophets.\u201d12 On the second and third Sundays of the month, the course of study is based on the teachings of Presidents of the Church. The resource for instruction in 1998\u201399 is a compilation of excerpts from the sermons of Brigham Young. It is a text rich in doctrine and application. The curriculum continues on the fourth Sunday with Teachings for Our Time, an opportunity to study current gospel issues approved by the First Presidency. Brethren, you who are the leaders of quorums and groups, please study the instructions that have been provided by the First Presidency regarding this new curriculum until you understand them fully. Then implement them precisely.\nThe Aaronic Priesthood quorums are also blessed with superb class material, although it wasn\u2019t always so. At the beginning of this century, while some stakes prepared printed, systematic lesson outlines for Aaronic Priesthood quorums, others left the young men to find their own way. This resulted \u201cin some unusual priesthood meetings by our standards. One lesser priesthood group, for example, divided its class time between religious lessons and such adventure books as Tom Sawyer, The Jungle Book, The Call of the Wild, Pigs Is Pigs, and Frank Among the Rancheros.\u201d13 Today such \u201ccultural enrichment\u201d is for other times and settings; when the quorum meets as a class, the time is reserved for things of a higher order. Today\u2019s Aaronic Priesthood curriculum includes such topics as \u201ccovenants guide our actions,\u201d \u201crespect for mothers and their divine role,\u201d \u201cvaluing and encouraging people with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cmoral courage,\u201d to name just a few. Aaronic Priesthood quorums deserve a real priesthood class as part of a solid quorum experience.\nSecond, a quorum is a fraternity. In the October general conference of 1982, Elder Robert L. Backman recounted the experience of a young man named Mark Peterson. Shortly after his ordination as a deacon, the deacons quorum presidency scheduled an appointment with Mark and his parents at their home.\n\u201cPromptly at the hour set, the doorbell rang. The members of the presidency stood on the porch, dressed in suits, white shirts, and ties, and each one carrying his scriptures.\n\u201cSitting down with Mark and his parents, they began with prayer, then handed an agenda to everyone there.\n\u201cThe president then opened the scriptures, having Mark and his father read those references which speak of the power of the Aaronic Priesthood, what it is, and the particular duties of a deacon.\n\u201cThe president then spoke about Mark\u2019s particular responsibilities and duties: how he should dress, how he should pass the sacrament, act as a messenger, collect fast offerings. And then they asked him if he had any questions.\n\u201cAt the end of the visit they welcomed him to the quorum and offered help whenever he needed it. As they left, Mark \u2026 said to his Dad: \u2018They were awesome!\u2019\u201d14\nThe fraternity of priesthood quorums can indeed be awesome. When I became a member of a Quorum of the Seventy, I assumed that I might be accepted by my brethren in the course of time if I were able to prove myself worthy of their association. I hoped someday to measure up and be approved. I was surprised to find myself immediately welcomed and from the outset treated as a brother, as an equal by men much more talented and accomplished than I. I have been supported and encouraged, loved and tutored in my quorum from my very first day of membership in it. Consequently, I feel a deep desire to contribute to the work of the quorum and to assist my brethren as much as I can.\nPresident David O. McKay taught: \u201cIf priesthood meant only personal distinction or individual elevation, there would be no need of groups or quorums. The very existence of such groups, established by divine authorization, proclaims our dependence upon one another, the indispensable need of mutual help and assistance.\u201d15\nAnd let it be remembered that nowhere is the fraternity of quorums more crucial than in the case of newly baptized brethren and their families. Quorum and group leaders should provide the leading voice and laboring oar in every ward and branch council regarding retention of converts.\nThird, a quorum is a service unit. When I spoke earlier of the new Melchizedek Priesthood curriculum, I did not mention what takes place on the first Sunday of the month. That is a very special meeting. On the first Sunday, priesthood bearers meet in quorums and groups to learn their duties and plan their work. On the agenda are training and discussion, reports and assignments. It is a time to learn how to administer correctly priesthood ordinances and blessings. It is a time for the business of the priesthood. It is a time for putting the priesthood to work. I can imagine just such a meeting 80 years ago in Lehi, Utah, as the elders laid a plan to harvest the sugar beets of their beleaguered brother, George Goates.\nBoth Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorums will find their soul in service. Our great presiding High Priest and exemplar is Jesus Christ, who declared:\n\u201cWhosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:\n\u201cAnd whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.\n\u201cFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d16\nYears ago President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed something of a vision regarding quorums in the priesthood. He said: \u201cIt will be a marvelous day, my brethren\u2014it will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord\u2014when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto, when each such man may appropriately be able to say, \u2018I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs, as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine. Working together, we shall grow spiritually as covenant sons of God. Working together, we can stand, without embarrassment and without fear, against every wind of adversity that might blow, be it economic, social, or spiritual.\u2019\u201d17\nWe must not delay or wait longer for this great day of fulfillment. Each of you who has received an ordination in the priesthood belongs to a quorum. If you live in a place where there are not enough brethren to form a quorum, you are a member of a priesthood group that will become a quorum. Resolve now to do all within your power to make of your priesthood quorum one worthy of the name and one faithful to its mission. Study with your brethren in the quorum class. Stand with them in the quorum fraternity. Work with them in quorum service. The quorum, brethren, the quorum, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nD. Todd Christofferson\nThe Priesthood Quorum\n1998\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "In our Northern Hemisphere, we are enjoying in this beautiful, bursting season of the year one of the great recurring miracles of nature\u2014the regeneration and renewal of the earth that we call spring. There may be a few wintry days left, but the sun has begun its vernal return, the buds are appearing on the flowers and trees, and luxuriant greenery is sprouting to the surface.\nHow fitting that just one week ago all of Christendom celebrated on Easter Day the great restoring and renewing resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, declaring all of the joy and eternal promise that event holds for mankind. With you, I welcome this season of the year which reminds us that God is a God of miracles, that his Only Begotten Son is \u201cthe resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in [him], though he were dead, yet shall he live.\u201d (John 11:25.)\nIn this beautiful time of year, we remember that death has no sting and the grave has no dominion. I testify that after every winter\u2019s season there is the miracle of springtime ahead\u2014in our personal journey through life as well as in nature. These restorations and renewals are a gift from the Lord Jesus Christ, the ultimate \u201cman for all seasons.\u201d I wish to speak briefly of some of those divine moments in our lives when the Savior reaches out to redeem and make whole and strengthen us.\nThe Psalmist has written:\n\u201cI cried unto God with my voice, \u2026 and he gave ear unto me. \u2026\n\u201cAnd I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. \u2026\n\u201cThou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.\u201d (Ps. 77:1, 10, 14.)\nAmong the signs of the true church, and included in the evidences of God\u2019s work in the world, are the manifestations of his power which we are helpless to explain or to fully understand. In the scriptures these divine acts and special blessings are variously referred to as miracles or signs or wonders or marvels.\nNot surprisingly, these signs and marvels were most evident in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, the very Son of God himself. But startling and wonder-filled as they were, Christ\u2019s many miracles were only reflections of those greater marvels which his Father had performed before him and continues to perform all around us. Indeed, the Savior\u2019s humble performance of such obviously divine acts may be just one very special application of the declarations he made:\n\u201cThe Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise\u201d (John 5:19) and \u201cI do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me\u201d (John 8:28).\nFor example, the first miracle by Jesus recorded in the New Testament was the turning of water into wine at the marriage at Cana. (See John 2:1\u201311.) But poor, indeed, was the making of the wine in the pots of stone, compared with its original making in the beauty of the vine and the abundance of the swelling grapes. No one could explain the onetime miracle at the wedding feast, but then neither could they explain the everyday miracle of the splendor of the vineyard itself.\nIt is most remarkable to witness one who is deaf made to hear again. But surely that great blessing is no more startling than the wondrous combination of bones and skin and nerves that lets our ears receive the beautiful world of sound. Should we not stand in awe of the blessing of hearing and give glory to God for that miracle, even as we do when hearing is restored after it has been lost?\nIs it not the same for the return of one\u2019s sight or the utterance of our speech, or even that greatest miracle of all\u2014the restoration of life? The original creations of the Father constitute a truly wonder-filled world. Are not the greatest miracles the fact that we have life and limb and sight and speech in the first place? Yes, there will always be plenty of miracles if we have eyes to see and ears to hear.\nJust one other reminder. Once we start to recognize the many miraculous and blessed manifestations of God and Christ in our lives\u2014the everyday variety as well as restored sight to the blind and restored hearing to the deaf\u2014we may be truly bewildered at the unexplainable principles and processes that bring about such wonders.\nIn the contemplation of miracles \u201cwe must of necessity recognize the operation of a power transcending our present human understanding,\u201d wrote Dr. James E. Talmage, who, as both a scientist and an Apostle of the Lord, had uniquely strong qualifications for examining such phenomena. (See Jesus the Christ, 3d ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 149.) Science and the unaided human mind, he said, have not advanced far enough to analyze and explain these wonders. But, he cautioned, to deny the reality of miracles on the ground that the results and manifestations must be fictitious simply because we cannot comprehend the means by which they have happened is arrogant on the face of it. (Ibid.) Indeed, those who have been the beneficiaries of such miracles are the most compelling witnesses of all. It is hard to argue with results.\nConsider this simple but telling account from the Savior\u2019s ministry to make manifest the works of God in men\u2019s lives.\nOne Sabbath day Jesus anointed the eyes of a man blind from birth, and the man\u2019s eyesight was restored. It was a startling and inspiring manifestation. Unfortunately, however, some who learned of it would not rejoice that one of the local citizens had his vision returned.\n\u201cTherefore said some of the Pharisees, This man [meaning Jesus] is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them,\u201d the scripture tells us. (John 9:16.)\nWith such a controversy inside their ranks, this group did a very intelligent thing\u2014they asked the opinion of the man who had been healed. \u201cWhat sayest thou of him, that \u2026 hath opened thine eyes?\u201d (John 9:17) they asked, and waited for his answer.\nAs he spoke, the blind man undoubtedly looked directly into their eyes (a new and precious privilege). He said plainly, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d (John 9:17.)\nBut that was an unsettling answer. After much discussion, including conversation with the man\u2019s parents, the Pharisees agreed to acknowledge that there had indeed been a miracle and that it might have come from God, but that this man must deny any role Christ may have played in the process:\n\u201cThen again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man [Jesus] is a sinner.\u201d (John 9:24.)\nUnencumbered by theory or law, the man said, slowly enough for everyone to hear, \u201cWhether [Jesus] be a sinner or no, I know not: [just] one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\u201d (John 9:25.)\nThe Pharisees, in total frustration and unable to argue with that single greatest and undeniable fact in the case, cast the man out of their presence. Then comes this sweet conclusion to a story about renewed sight and brighter light:\n\u201cJesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\n\u201cHe answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?\n\u201cAnd Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.\n\u201cAnd he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.\u201d (John 9:35\u201338.)\nNow sight had been given twice\u2014once to remedy a congenital defect and once to behold the King of Kings before He would ascend to His eternal throne. Jesus had quickened both temporal and spiritual vision. He had cast his light into a dark place, and this man, like many others in that day as well as in our own, had accepted the light and had seen.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball taught us with a book by the title Faith Precedes the Miracle. But there is, of course, an increase of faith that should follow the miracle as well. As a result of the many miracles in our lives, we should be more humble and more grateful, more kind and more believing. When we are personal witnesses to these wonders which God performs, it should increase our respect and love for him; it should improve the way we behave. We will live better and love more if we will remember that. We are miracles in our own right, every one of us, and the resurrected Son of God is the greatest miracle of all. He is, indeed, the miracle of miracles, and every day of his life he gave evidence of it. We should try to follow after him in that example.\nMoroni quotes his father in the Book of Mormon:\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven? \u2026 Has the day of miracles ceased?\u201d (Moro. 7:27, 35.)\n\u201cI say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men. \u2026 [nor will they], so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved.\u201d (Moro. 7:29, 36.)\nI testify of God\u2019s goodness and Christ\u2019s power, and of the privilege Apostles have been given. I know that Peter and John did take a lame man by the right hand and, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, command him to rise up and walk\u2014and he did walk. (See Acts 3:1\u201311.) I testify of the restoration of the gospel in these latter days and of the priesthood powers that make possible the many modern miracles of our dispensation.\nI say of our Father as the Psalmist said, \u201cThou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.\u201d (Ps. 77:14.) In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nHoward W. Hunter\nThe God That Doest Wonders\n1989\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 2:51 PM\nAmerican Legal and Political Institutions\nAmerican Legal and Political\nInstitutions\nThe Book of Mormon prophet Nephi observed that Isaiah\u2019s writings\ncould be hard to understand without a knowledge of the geography and\nhistory of Jerusalem, his homeland. 1 The truths Isaiah taught had\nuniversal value but a specific context. Similarly, the early history of the\nChurch occurred in a particular political and geographic context.\nUnderstanding this context makes many of the events in early Church\nhistory easier to follow.\nEarly America as an Experiment\nJoseph Smith Sr., Lucy Mack Smith, and other early Saints had been\nborn as British subjects in the American colonies. During a lengthy War\nof Independence, the former colonies took the name United States and\nadopted a democratic form of government. Between 1787 and 1789\nrepresentatives from the states met and drafted a Constitution that\nbalanced power between different groups: between the people, the\nvarious states, and the new national, or \u201cfederal,\u201d government; and\nbetween Congress, the president and his cabinet, and the federal courts.\nThe Constitution stipulated that the president and most members of\nCongress were to be elected, but only men who owned property were\npermitted to vote at that time. The Constitution restricted the federal\ngovernment from establishing an official religion or interfering with the\nfree exercise of religion. In general, the federal government was much\nweaker then than it is in the United States today, with more authority\nreserved to the states and local communities.\nThe system of government established in the United States was unusual\nand widely seen as experimental. Many early members of the Church\nwere born and lived during this time, not long after the founding of the\nnation. For example, when Joseph Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith were\nmarried, George Washington was serving as the country\u2019s first\npresident. After he left office, two competing political parties became an\nincreasingly important aspect of American politics. Additionally,\nsignificant questions remained about the practical balance of power\nbetween the different branches of government, the roles of federal and\nstate governments, and the acceptability of communities bypassing the\nlaw to resolve disputes through vigilante action. 2 Questions also\nremained about whether the United States would be able to maintain\nindependence, whether the states would stay united, how the country\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/american-legal-and-political-institutions?lang=eng\n1/44/8/23, 2:51 PM\nAmerican Legal and Political Institutions\nwould relate to other nations, and whether the newly established\ngovernment could ensure stability for the populace and rights for\nminority groups in a system shaped by majority rule.\nThe Early Church and the Evolving American\nSystem\nBy 1830 when the Church was organized, the political and legal\ninstitutions of the United States were still evolving. While the new\nnation claimed to defend freedom of religion, the early Saints often\nchallenged many Americans\u2019 religious expectations. This seemed\nespecially true when the Saints gathered to one place and began\nbuilding a community. Their neighbors often worried about the\ninfluence so many Latter-day Saints would have on local elections. In\nmany instances, the Saints\u2019 commitment to religious freedom in the face\nof continual opposition tested the strength of America\u2019s legal and\npolitical institutions.\nIn New York and Ohio, opponents of the Church attempted to use both\nthe courts and vigilante action to harass the Saints. 3 In the face of such\nopposition, the Saints became strong advocates for religious freedom\nand legal due process for the accused. Even when they were sympathetic\nto the Saints, however, local law enforcement officials and judges did\nnot always feel authorized to assist them in the face of public\nopposition.\nIn Missouri, persecution was particularly intense. 4 In 1833, a mob\norganized by leading local citizens expelled the Saints from Jackson\nCounty (an administrative subdivision of a state), where they lived.\nAfter Joseph Smith received a revelation in which the Lord stated he\n\u201cestablished the constitution of this Land by the hands of wise men,\u201d\nthe Saints began a long quest to petition the government for help to\nsecure their rights. 5 They initially appealed to the governor (or chief\nexecutive) of the state. However, the Saints had difficulty obtaining fair\ntreatment because most local people, including members of the\nvolunteer militias upon which the state government depended to\nmaintain order, opposed them. The Saints later appealed to\nU.S. president Martin Van Buren, but fearing he would lose the votes of\nMissourians, he declined to assist them.\nBy 1844, Joseph Smith and the Saints had grown frustrated with the\ninability or unwillingness of the state and federal governments to\nprotect their rights. When the major presidential candidates that year\nwould not promise to defend the Saints\u2019 religious and other freedoms,\nJoseph Smith campaigned for United States president himself,\nchampioning not only religious freedom but also such causes as a\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/american-legal-and-political-institutions?lang=eng\n2/44/8/23, 2:51 PM\nAmerican Legal and Political Institutions\ngradual abolition of slavery, prison reform, and national expansion on\ncondition of receiving the consent of American Indian groups. 6 Before\nthe election, however, Joseph Smith was murdered by a mob after the\nlocal militia, which was set to guard the jail where he stayed while\nawaiting trial, failed to protect him. 7\nWestward Migration, Conflict, and Resolution\nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young and the other Apostles\nled the Saints westward, out of the United States and into what was\nthen Mexican territory. At this time, the U.S. was fighting a war with\nMexico, and the area in which the Saints settled soon became a United\nStates territory known as Utah. Unlike states, which were largely self-\ngoverning, territories fell under the direct control of the federal\ngovernment. This meant that territorial officials such as governors and\njudges were appointed by the president, rather than elected by local\ncitizens.\nTension often existed between the Saints and the federal government.\nThe U.S. president appointed Brigham Young as the first governor of\nUtah, but he and the Saints clashed with other territorial officials. In\n1857 and 1858, war seemed possible between the Saints and the federal\ngovernment after the president sent an army to Utah to put down a\nreported rebellion and install a new governor to replace Brigham\nYoung. Tensions rose again after the U.S. government took legislative\naction to criminalize plural marriage in the 1860s. In the 1870s and\n1880s, Mormon women in particular became politically active in\nprotesting antipolygamy laws and were among the first women in the\nUnited States and the world to win the right to vote.\nJust as the Saints had sought justice from state and federal executives in\nthe wake of the Missouri persecutions, they sought protection from the\nAmerican court system, arguing that they had a right to continue plural\nmarriage as a religious practice. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected\ntheir arguments in 1879, Church members exercised civil disobedience,\narguing that obedience to the laws of God was more important than\nobedience to unjust laws. As the federal government pursued\nincreasingly aggressive actions to punish Latter-day Saints who\npracticed plural marriage, Church leaders sought revelation about how\nto reconcile the demands of their religious practice with the laws of the\nland. Church President Wilford Woodruff prayed for and received the\nanswer by revelation in 1890, which led the Church to end its practice of\nplural marriage.\nIn 1896, Utah became a state, allowing most Latter-day Saint men and\nwomen to participate more actively in American civic life. Though some\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/american-legal-and-political-institutions?lang=eng\n3/44/8/23, 2:51 PM\nAmerican Legal and Political Institutions\nopposition to the Saints\u2019 involvement in politics continued, by 1908, a\ncongressional committee ratified the election of Reed Smoot, a member\nof the Quorum of the Twelve, to the United States Senate. Since that\ntime, Latter-day Saints have participated actively in American politics,\nboth as voters and elected officials. The Church maintains a neutral\nposition in American party politics but reserves the right to make\nstatements on questions of moral import.\nBibliography\nThe following publications provide further information about this topic.

I can visualize grandfathers, fathers, bishops, deacons, teachers, and priests seated together, some as families or quorums; also full-time missionaries, students, and new converts\u2014all bearers of the Holy Priesthood of God. And beyond this historical Salt Lake Tabernacle are hundreds more such assemblies of priesthood bearers anxiously awaiting encouragement and instruction from our prophet and his noble counselors.\nThis past summer, Clarence Neslen, Jr., took his family to Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. They enjoyed exploring the Columbia Icefields, jumping over crevasses in the famous Athabasca Glacier. It was an exciting experience until eleven-year-old Cannon, attempting to jump across a crevasse, missed and fell into the deep chasm. He became wedged between the walls of ice. As his father looked down some thirty feet to where his son was trapped, he was further alarmed as he saw a river of icy water flowing beneath the crevasse.\nSeveral young men were also exploring the glacier. They heard the cries for help and came running. They had a small rope but soon realized that it was not strong enough to pull Cannon to safety. If it broke, Cannon would most assuredly fall into the rushing river of freezing water.\nSister Neslen and others ran to a nearby lodge for help. The nearest park ranger camp was seventy-five miles away. They learned by telephone that two park rangers were near the icefields. Located by radio, they rushed to the rescue. Time was short, decisions urgent, and silent prayers were sent heavenward.\nBrother Neslen tried to calm his son and soothe his fears. Hypothermia was setting in. Young Cannon\u2019s shirt had been pushed up as he fell. His bare skin was now pressed against the cold walls of the glacier. To keep his son from unconsciousness, the father called down to him to keep praying, to wiggle his fingers and toes, and to sing his favorite songs. Over and over Cannon sang, \u201cI am a child of God, and he has sent me here, has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear\u201d (Hymns, 1985, no. 301). All were strengthened by Cannon\u2019s faith and determination. But he was beginning to weaken. His father kept assuring him that help would soon arrive and that his Heavenly Father would hear his prayers.\nThe two rangers arrived. Spikes were driven into the ice, and ropes were attached to a ranger, who was lowered to rescue Cannon. But the walls were too narrow for him. Their only chance was to lower a looped rope and pray he was alert enough to grasp it and then have the strength to hold on as they tried to pull him out.\nBrother Neslen offered the most fervent prayer of his life, he said. He pleaded with the Lord to save his son\u2019s life. \u201cA feeling of assurance and calm came over me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I knew that he would be saved.\u201d\nCannon had lapsed into unconsciousness. His father called down encouragement, rousing his son sufficiently that Cannon\u2019s icy fingers now were able to catch hold of the rope. \u201cHold on with all of your might!\u201d his father called down to him. Cannon was carefully pulled up\u2014inch by inch, foot by foot\u2014all thirty feet. When he was finally pulled to safety, he was unconscious. His fingers had miraculously frozen around the rope and had to be pried loose.\nHe was immediately wrapped in blankets and rushed to a waiting ambulance, but there was not enough warmth to raise his body temperature sufficiently. A paramedic undressed Cannon, then took off his own coat and shirt and held Cannon against his bare chest so that his body heat would radiate to the boy. Cannon slowly responded to the loving care of his rescuers. The prayers of all had been answered.\nYoung Cannon Neslen, a newly ordained deacon, is here in this audience tonight. We thank our Father in Heaven that his life was spared. He was spared for a purpose. He told his father that, while wedged in the ice, he felt a comforting assurance that he would be saved. He knows God loves him and that He has a special mission for him to perform in this life.\nNot unlike Cannon Neslen, who accidentally fell into a crevasse, some of your friends\u2014and perhaps even some of you\u2014have slipped into spiritual crevasses.\nSpiritual crevasses symbolize the temptations and pitfalls that too many of our youth are tragically encountering: alcohol, with its wine coolers and keg parties, drug tampering and dependency, R- and X-rated films and videos, which often culminate in sexual immorality. On the edge of those ominous crevasses are parents and others who, with fervent prayers, cry for help and assistance. Like Cannon\u2019s father, they, too, pray that their sons or daughters will hold on to the extended lifeline. Their love, and the teachings of the scriptures and the assurance of the eternal blessings of the Savior\u2019s atonement, are sure lifelines to safety.\nYouth are not the only ones who slip into crevasses.\nA stake president recently told me that a respected member who had held Church leadership positions was enticed by some business friends to try the cocaine drug \u201ccrack.\u201d The men were depressed. Their company was failing, and they succumbed to the evil enticement of illegal drugs.\nHe wasted $18,000 buying \u201ccrack,\u201d lost his job, underwent a personality change, and finally was hospitalized. Through it all, his wife stayed by him. She found a job, and they began the struggle of putting his life back together. His Church friends helped him get another job.\nHis mind is seriously affected. He is still somewhat dependent on some drugs. The hope and prayer of his family is that he will be able to hold on to the lifeline.\nWhen Satan was cast down to earth with his innumerable hosts, he became \u201cthe father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive \u2026, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice\u201d (Moses 4:4).\nOne of Satan\u2019s methods is to distract and entice us so that we will take our eyes off the dangerous crevasses. He has succeeded to such an extent that many no longer recognize sin as sin. Movies, television, and magazines have glorified sin into what they think is an acceptable life-style: \u201c[fornication], adultery, incest, \u2026 serial marriages, drug abuse, violence and double-dealing of every imaginable variety, [that is] often portrayed as [normal] behavior; where people who do good are not \u2026 rewarded and those who do evil are not punished.\u201d So stated a Los Angeles Times writer (see Salt Lake Tribune, 9 Aug. 1986, p. C7).\nAssuredly we live in a time spoken of by Isaiah when men \u201ccall evil good, and good evil\u201d (Isa. 5:20).\nIf any of you are walking in ice fields near open crevasses, do you see the warning signs? \u201cDanger\u2014don\u2019t go near the edge\u201d? Don\u2019t trifle with evil. You will lose. We pray that you will not display the somewhat arrogant attitude of some who say, \u201cI can handle it!\u201d or \u201cEveryone else does it!\u201d\nA friend, visiting relatives in another state for a high school graduation, noticed a few students chewing tobacco. When he asked his nephew about it, the young man replied, \u201cEverybody does it!\u201d\nMy friend\u2019s nephew did not chew tobacco, but he did believe most boys did. Even in schools where in reality only a few students are using drugs, drinking alcohol, or smoking, nonusers commonly believe that most of their fellow students are doing it.\nEveryone is not doing it. You don\u2019t! And you influence your friends. And others watch you. You help set the standard.\nYoung men, you are a royal brotherhood\u2014not because you\u2019re better than anyone else\u2014but because the Lord has blessed you with special privileges and responsibilities.\nYou were foreordained to come to earth at a time when the fulness of the gospel was on the earth. You were foreordained to receive his priesthood. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, \u201cEvery man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was\u201d (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1977, p. 365).\nYou are the Lord\u2019s special resource for teaching the gospel to all his other children. You are different from other teenagers who have neither your understanding nor your responsibilities.\nYou are one of his spirit sons, singled out with a special calling. And we know that he loves you. You have the gift of the Holy Ghost. You can discern good from evil. And with the power of the priesthood, you have the authority to represent your Heavenly Father.\nNow, my brethren, let us who have been given this most precious responsibility of the holy priesthood \u201carise,\u201d as father Lehi declared, and \u201cput on the armor of righteousness\u201d (2 Ne. 21\u201323).\nTo help each of us avoid the pitfalls and crevasses in life, the Lord has provided the lifeline of the precious truths in the scriptures, which, if held on to, will allow us to escape both physical and spiritual danger.\nThe Word of Wisdom was given so that we might have clear minds and healthy bodies; the Sermon on the Mount, to make us sensitive to one another\u2019s needs; and the Ten Commandments\u2014cut in stone by the finger of God\u2014forbidding us to sin. He declared, \u201cThou shalt not.\u201d\nI urge each of you to develop a personal companionship with the scriptures.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball read the Bible when he was fourteen years old\u2014all 66 books and 1,519 pages. \u201cIf I could do it by coal-oil light,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can do it by electric light\u201d (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1982, p. 131).\nPresident Kimball was a very special teacher for all of us. He didn\u2019t have a car or a bicycle, but he did have nine cows to milk every morning and night.\nHe said, \u201cI thought, \u2018What a waste of time, to sit on a three-legged stool. Maybe there is something else I could do while I am milking.\u2019\u201d He placed a copy of the Articles of Faith on the ground beside him and went through them, over and over, until he had memorized them. Then he repeated the Ten Commandments over and over until he learned them. He memorized important scriptures that would help him on his mission\u2014all while he milked the cows. He didn\u2019t have time to waste; he had things to do with his life (see The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 131).\nIt would be a wonderful thing for you young men to use your time wisely by learning of God\u2019s ways.\nPresident Ezra Taft Benson has challenged each of us to read the Book of Mormon\u2014the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion. We understand that thousands of young men have accepted the challenge and are now reading the Book of Mormon.\nAs the angel Moroni sealed up the gold plates, he was inspired to promise future generations\u2014that is, us\u2014that on certain conditions God will manifest the truth of those records by the power of the Holy Ghost, and that\u2014listen carefully\u2014\u201cby the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things\u201d (see Moro. 10:4\u20135).\nImagine such a promise. If you desire with a sincere heart, with faith in Christ, you can understand all things.\nJeffrey Holland, president of Brigham Young University, while working on his Ph.D. at a prominent eastern American university, got to know well one of the reference librarians who had helped him with some research.\nOne day he said, \u201cIlene, I need to know how many books we have in the University Library which claim to have been delivered by an angel.\u201d\nAs you can imagine, the librarian gave him a peculiar look and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any books that have been delivered by angels. Swords maybe, or chariots, but I don\u2019t know of any books.\u201d\n\u201cWell, just run a check for me would you? It may take a little doing, but I really would like to know.\u201d\nThe librarian dutifully did some checking of the nine million books in the library. For several days she had nothing to report, but then one day she smilingly said, \u201cMr. Holland, I have a book for you. I found one book which, it is claimed, was delivered by an angel,\u201d and she held up a paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. \u201cI\u2019m told you can get them for a dollar. My goodness,\u201d she continued, \u201can angel\u2019s book for a dollar! You would think angels would charge more, but then again,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere would they spend it?\u201d (See Pat Holland, President\u2019s Welcome Assembly, Brigham Young University, 9 Sept. 1986).\nThink of it\u2014one book has been delivered by an angel, and it teaches of your eternal salvation. And each of you owns a true copy!\nMay the Lord bless each of you with your life\u2019s opportunities. Put your trust in Him to avoid the crevasses of sin and evil. Hold on to the lifeline of the gospel. You can make correct choices\u2014the ones you know in your heart will be for your best good. We love you and testify of the truthfulness of the gospel of Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDavid B. Haight\nSpiritual Crevasses\n1986\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, I am pleased to be here with you tonight. Few responsibilities weigh heavier than speaking to this great assembly of priesthood holders because the priesthood is the mightiest force on the earth. As B. H. Roberts reminds us: \u201cThe priesthood is a solemn thing. To hold power delegated to one by Almighty God\u2014to have authority to speak and act in his name, and have it of the same binding force as if the Deity himself spoke or acted, is both an honor and a responsibility.\u201d1 To me, you young men look like Helaman\u2019s stripling warriors, \u201cexceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity.\u201d Like them, we hope you are men who are \u201ctrue at all times in whatsoever thing [you are] entrusted.\u201d2\nTonight I plead for greater consistency between our beliefs and actions. I take as my text the 13th article of faith. \u201cWe believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u2014We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\u201d3 Brethren, does the Spirit of Christ that we have taken upon ourselves spill over into our behavior in the workforce? Brigham Young said: \u201cWe want the Saints to increase in goodness, until our mechanics, for instance, are so honest and reliable that this Railroad Company will say, \u2018Give us a \u201cMormon\u201d Elder for an engineer, then none need have the least fear to ride, for if he knows there is danger he will take every measure necessary to preserve the lives of those entrusted to his care.\u2019 I want to see our Elders so full of integrity that they will be preferred by this Company for their engine builders, watchmen, engineers, clerks, and business managers. If we live our religion and are worthy [of] the name of Latter-day Saints, we are just the men that all such business can be entrusted to with perfect safety; if it can not it will prove that we do not live our religion.\u201d4 What President Young urged of the priesthood holders in his day is just as important in our day. The Spirit of Christ should permeate all we do, whether at work, at school, or at home.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball taught us to \u201cmake one-time decisions to do right.\u201d He made important decisions early in his life so that he did not have to perpetually remake those decisions. He said, \u201cWe can push some things away from us once and have done with them \u2026 without having to brood and redecide a hundred times what it is we will do and what we will not do.\u201d5\nDuring World War II, I observed some very special young men from faithful Latter-day Saint homes lower their standards little by little and lose some of their spirituality. In some places overseas the water was not safe to drink, and the purifying chemicals made the water taste worse. Some started to drink coffee to disguise the taste. From time to time the army gave us cigarettes and a ration of liquor. Some did not take their rations at all. Others took them to trade for goods and money even though they did not smoke or drink. A few took them to experiment and became slaves for the rest of their lives. The habits they acquired during the war robbed them of their spiritual potential and many blessings of the Lord.\nHolders of the priesthood of God should be men of impeccable character. I have always admired the integrity of Father Abraham when he returned from Egypt to Palestine. He came with his nephew Lot. Soon there was strife between the herdmen of Abraham\u2019s cattle and the herdmen of Lot\u2019s cattle. \u201cAnd Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.\u201d6 Abraham offered Lot his choice of property, either on his left hand or on his right. Lot chose the more productive land to the east, and so Abraham took the land to the west. In course of time, Lot and all of his household were captured in battle and taken to Dan, over a hundred miles to the north. When Abraham heard of his fate, he armed 318 of his servants and went in pursuit. He not only rescued Lot and his family but also restored to them their property in Sodom. The king of Sodom returned from exile and, in gratitude, offered Abraham the spoils of the victory. But these Abraham declined, saying, \u201cI will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and \u2026 I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.\u201d7 In these episodes, Abraham demonstrated his fairness, integrity, and faith. And the Lord rewarded him with both spiritual and earthly blessings so that ultimately he prospered far more than Lot.\nHonesty is a very important part of character. We have all seen men who think they are not accountable to the laws of men or of God. They seem to feel that the rules of human conduct do not apply to them. A popular philosophy is \u201cWhat can I get away with?\u201d As someone once said, \u201cThe difference between a moral man and a man of honor is that the latter regrets a discreditable act even when it has worked.\u201d8\nHonesty begins when we are young. When I was 11 years old, I looked forward eagerly to my magical 12th birthday when I could become a deacon and a Scout. My mother helped me learn the Articles of Faith, the Scout Law and Motto, and other requirements so that I would have a good start when that special birthday arrived.\nSince I had no sisters, my brothers and I were given some of the inside chores as well as outside ones, such as milking and taking care of the animals. One day Mother left me to wash the dishes and clean the kitchen while she attended to a sick neighbor. I agreed to do these duties but put off doing the dishes. Time ran out and they didn\u2019t get done. In fact, they didn\u2019t even get started. When Mother came home and saw the kitchen, she put on her apron and went to the sink. She spoke only three words, which stung worse than the sting of a dozen hornets. They were the first three words of the Scout Law: \u201cOn my honor.\u201d That day I resolved that I would never give my mother cause to repeat those words to me again.\nOur honor should make us honest in all we do. Some youths fail to honor debts to their parents. \u201cMay I borrow five dollars for the show?\u201d That contains an implied promise to repay the debt, but the promise is made so casually that it is forgotten as it is spoken.\nWe must be careful of the misuse of credit. The use of credit cards in many places has increased consumer debt to staggering proportions. I am reminded of the story of \u201can elderly farmer [who] wrote to a mail order house as follows: \u2018Please send me one of the gasoline engines you show on page 787, and if it\u2019s any good, I\u2019ll send you a check.\u2019\n\u201cIn time he received the following reply: \u2018Please send check. If it\u2019s any good, we\u2019ll send the engine.\u2019\u201d9\nContemporary society rushes headlong to accumulate the material goods of this world. This leads many to think they can alter the law of the harvest, reaping rewards without paying the price of honest toil and effort. Wishing to prosper immediately, they speculate in high-risk financial schemes that promote instant wealth. This all too frequently results in economic reverses, sometimes even financial ruin. In Proverbs we read, \u201cA faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.\u201d10\nAs members of the Church and particularly as holders of the priesthood, we believe in being chaste. There is no different or double standard for moral cleanliness for men and women in the Church. In fact, I believe holders of the priesthood have a greater responsibility to maintain standards of chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage. The Lord has said, \u201cBe ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d11 This means being pure in thought as well as in deed. The Prophet Joseph Smith stated, \u201cIf we would come before God, we must keep ourselves pure, as He is pure.\u201d12 If husband and wife will remain pure and chaste, completely devoted to each other during the storms and sunshine of life, their love for one another will deepen into something of supernal fulfillment. An early LDS Apostle, Parley P. Pratt, said, \u201cFrom this union of affection, springs all the other relationships, social joys and affections diffused through every branch of human existence.\u201d13\nAs the Prophet Joseph wrote in the 13th article of faith, \u201cWe believe in being \u2026 benevolent \u2026 and in doing good [works].\u201d Since the beginning of the Church, full-time missionaries have done good works. We are grateful for the 58,000-plus missionaries who are currently serving. The First Presidency have the opportunity to meet with many ambassadors, prime ministers, rulers, and prominent public and political figures from all over the world. Frequently they say: \u201cWe have met your missionaries. We have seen them in many places.\u201d Sometimes these prominent people visit the Missionary Training Center in Provo and see the thousands of missionaries there. These officials always seem to be greatly impressed. The missionaries appear well groomed and dignified. Sometimes they say, \u201cWe would like our children to be associated with your young people at one of your schools.\u201d\nBeing a missionary is a continuing responsibility. Returned missionaries need to be exemplary in living the principles which they taught to others in the mission field. President Spencer W. Kimball said: \u201cPlease, you returned missionaries \u2026, please do not abandon in appearance or principle or habit the great experiences of the mission field when you were like Alma and the sons of Mosiah, as the very angels of God to the people you met and taught and baptized. We do not expect you to wear a tie, white shirt, and a dark blue suit every day now that you are back in school. But surely it is not too much to ask that your good grooming be maintained, that your personal habits reflect cleanliness and dignity and pride in the principles of the gospel you taught. We ask you for the good of the kingdom and all those who have done and yet do take pride in you.\u201d14\nThe admonition of Paul includes the hope to be able to endure all things. Elder Clinton Cutler exemplified how hope, perseverance, and steadfastness call forth the blessings of heaven. He literally became an instrument in the hands of the Lord. Clint and Carma Cutler were high school sweethearts. They began married life by attending college on a basketball scholarship. But they soon became pressed financially, so Clint went to work for the telephone company. His first job was washing, greasing, and maintaining the company trucks. That led to work in the central office as a cable repairman. For three and a half years Clint worked full time and went to college full time. He graduated in December 1960 with honors. By that time he had four children.\nA series of transfers and promotions followed. In 1963, while serving in Riverdale, Utah, Clint was called to be a bishop. Three years later they moved to Midvale, Utah, where Clint was called to be the second counselor in the stake presidency.\nAfter another three years, Clint was transferred to Denver, where he was called as president of the Littleton Colorado Stake. Other moves followed, one taking them to Boise, Idaho, where he was called to be the president of the Boise Idaho West Stake. Another transfer brought them back to Salt Lake City, where Clint was called as a regional representative. His final promotion, in 1984, was as assistant vice president/director of marketing operations. His company seemed to transfer him where the Lord needed him.\nOn his retirement they returned to Utah, and soon Clint received the call to serve as president of the Washington Seattle Mission. In April 1990 his final call to service came to serve as a General Authority in the Second Quorum of the Seventy. His call to serve ended with his death on April 9, 1994, following a heroic struggle with cancer.\nI do not wish to imply that presiding callings nor career promotions are the measure of faithfulness and worthiness. They are not and never have been. We have all been richly blessed by the humble, faithful teachers who have taught us the gospel by precept and example. But Elder Cutler\u2019s example shows that faith, hope, and perseverance help our Father in Heaven to strengthen us and enhance our abilities and opportunities, however ordinary they may be.\nMembers of the Church are to seek after loveliness. We do not seek a veneer painted on by a worldly brush but the pure, innate beauty that God has planted in our souls. We should seek after those things that endow higher thoughts and finer impulses. Man, as President John Taylor once said, \u201cis destined, if he improves his opportunities, to higher and greater blessings and glory than are associated with this earth in its present state: \u2026 he may stand pure, virtuous, intelligent, and honourable, as a son of God, and seek for, and be guided and governed by his Father\u2019s counsels.\u201d15 Indeed we may say with President Brigham Young that we hope \u201cto be gentle and kind, modest and truthful, to be full of faith and integrity, \u2026 [for] goodness sheds a halo of loveliness around every person who possesses it, making their countenances beam with light, and their society desirable because of its excellency.\u201d16\nIn the history of this Church, we have \u201cendured many things.\u201d As we look forward to the future, we \u201chope to be able to endure all things.\u201d I am confident that we will do so, even though no one knows fully what may lie ahead. How will we endure all things? The answer is amazingly simple: We shall do so by faith, by unity, and by following the prophets of God. It has been so in the past; it will be so in the future.\nIn His infinite wisdom, since the beginning of the earth, God has led His people through prophets. Only one person, however, can exercise all of the keys of authority at one time. In our day, that prophet is President Gordon B. Hinckley. As we see the wondrous worldwide programs of the Church, who can doubt President Hinckley\u2019s prophetic leadership? We all pray that God will continue to bear him up and magnify him in every way. Sustaining fully President Hinckley and those associated with him as prophets, seers, and revelators will help us to endure all things. That we may do so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJames E. Faust\n\u201cWe Seek After These Things\u201d\n1998\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Who can help but be uplifted and inspired just to worship in this historic tabernacle and to listen to this glorious choir?\nIt has been said that \u201cwhen Evan Stephens was conductor of the Tabernacle Choir, he was thrilled on one occasion by a sermon delivered by the late President Joseph F. Smith on the subject, [of \u201cThe Faith of Latter-day Saint Youth.\u201d] At the close of the service Professor Stephens strolled alone up City Creek Canyon [to the north], pondering the inspired words of the President. Suddenly [the inspiration of heaven] came upon him and seated upon a rock which was standing firm under the pressure of the rushing water, he wrote with a pencil\u201d these words:\nShall the youth of Zion falter\nIn defending truth and right?\nWhile the enemy assaileth,\nShall [they] shrink or shun the fight?\n No!\nTrue to the faith that [their] parents have cherished,\nTrue to the truth for which martyrs have perished,\nTo God\u2019s command, Soul, heart, and hand,\nFaithful and true [they] will ever stand.\nIn that early day, I am confident that youth were faced with difficult challenges to meet and vexing problems to solve. Youth is not a time of ease nor of freedom from perplexing questions. It wasn\u2019t then, and it surely isn\u2019t today. In fact, as time passes it seems that the difficulties of youth increase in size and scope. Temptation continues to loom large on life\u2019s horizon. Accounts of violence, theft, drug abuse, and pornography blare forth from the television screen and peer constantly from most daily newspapers. Such examples blur our vision and fault our thinking. Soon assumptions become generally accepted opinions, and all youth everywhere are categorized as \u201cnot so good as yesteryear,\u201d or \u201cthe worst generation yet.\u201d How wrong are such opinions! How incorrect are such statements!\nTrue, today is a new day with new trials, new troubles, and new temptations, but hundreds of thousands of Latter-day Saint youth strive constantly and serve diligently, true to the faith, as their counterparts of earlier years so nobly did. Because the contrast between good and evil is so stark, the exceptions to the prevailing trends are magnified, observed, and appreciated by decent persons throughout the world.\nLet me share with you a pointed letter which came from a resident of Minnesota. It was addressed to Brigham Young University:\n\u201cGentlemen:\n\u201cBeginning December 22, I made a bus trip from southern Minnesota to Florida via Des Moines and Chicago and points south.\n\u201cThere was a large group of young men and women traveling the approximately same route from Des Moines. These fine young people were students from Brigham Young [University] going home for the holidays.\n\u201cThey were all very polite, well-behaved, articulate young men and women. It was a pleasure to travel with them\u2014to know them\u2014and it gave me a new hope for the future.\n\u201cI realized that the university cannot do this. Young men and women of their caliber are the product of fine homes. The credit is due the parents. I cannot reach the parents, so my appreciation must go to the school.\u201d\nSuch comments are not isolated, but rather typical, for which we are ever pleased. Our Latter-day Saint students are excellent examples of faith in action.\nAnother group which amazes the world and inspires faith is that army of Latter-day Saint missionaries, now more than 26,600 strong, currently serving throughout the world. All through their lives, these young men and women have prepared for and awaited that special day when a mission call is received. Fathers become justifiably proud and mothers somewhat anxious. Well do I remember the recommendation form of one missionary on which the bishop had written:\n\u201cThis is the most outstanding young man I have ever recommended. He has excelled in all aspects of his life. He was president of his Aaronic Priesthood quorums and an officer at his high school. He lettered in track and football. I have never recommended a more outstanding candidate. I am proud to be his father.\u201d\nMore generally, the bishop and stake president write, \u201cJohn is a fine young man. He has prepared for his mission physically, mentally, financially, and spiritually. He will serve gladly and with distinction wherever he is called.\u201d\nOne day I was with President Spencer W. Kimball as he signed these special calls to full-time missionary service. Suddenly he noticed the call of his own grandson. He signed his name as president of the Church and then penned a personal line at the bottom which read, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. Love, Grandpa.\u201d\nWhen the call is received, the college text is closed and the scriptures opened. Family, friends, and often a special friend are left behind. Suspended are dating, dancing, and driving, as the three Ds are exchanged for the three Ts\u2014tracting, teaching, and testifying.\nLet us examine specifically several missionary profiles of faith, that we might better consider the question \u201cShall the youth of Zion falter?\u201d\nFor a first profile, I mention Jose Garcia from Old Mexico. Born in poverty but nurtured in faith, Jose prepared for a mission call. I was present the day his recommendation was received. There appeared the statement: \u201cBrother Garcia will serve at great sacrifice to his family, for he is the means of much of the family support. He has but one possession\u2014a treasured stamp collection\u2014which he is willing to sell, if necessary, to help finance his mission.\u201d\nPresident Kimball listened attentively as this statement was read to him, and then he responded: \u201cHave him sell his stamp collection. Such sacrifice will be to him a blessing.\u201d Then, with a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face, this loving prophet said, \u201cEach month at Church headquarters we receive thousands of letters from all parts of the world. See that we save these stamps and provide them to Jose at the conclusion of his mission. He will have, without cost, the finest stamp collection of any young man in Mexico.\u201d\nThere seemed to echo from another place, another time, the experience of the Master:\n\u201cAnd he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.\n\u201cAnd he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.\n\u201cAnd he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.\u201d (Luke 12:1\u20133.)\n\u201cFor all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living\u201d (Mark 12:44).\nFor a second profile, I turn from Mexico to a missionary at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, desperately struggling to become proficient in the German language, that he might be an effective missionary to the people of southern Germany. Each day as he opened his German grammar text, he noticed with interest and curiosity that the front cover displayed a picture of a most quaint and ancient house in Rothenburg, West Germany. Beneath the picture, the location was given. In his heart that young man determined, \u201cI\u2019ll visit that house and teach the truth to whoever lives within it.\u201d This he did. The result was the conversion and baptism of Sister Helma Hahn. Today she devotes much of her time speaking to tourists who come from all over the world to see her house. She delights in telling them of the blessings which the gospel of Jesus Christ has brought to her. Her house is perhaps one of the most frequently photographed houses in the entire world. No visitor leaves without hearing in simple yet earnest words her testimony of praise and gratitude. That missionary who brought to Sister Hahn the gospel remembered the sacred charge: \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Matt. 28:19).\nProfile number three also relates to a missionary of unfaltering faith, Elder Mark Skidmore. When he received his call to Norway, he knew not one word of Norwegian\u2014yet he realized that to teach and to testify he would need proficiency in the language of the Norwegian people. To himself he made a private vow: \u201cI will not speak English until I have brought into the waters of baptism my first Norwegian family.\u201d He plodded. He prayed. He pleaded. He worked. After the trial of his faith came the desired blessing. He taught and baptized a choice family. He then spoke in English for the first time in six months. I met with him that same week. His expression was one of thanksgiving and gratitude. I thought of the words of Moroni, that courageous captain: \u201cI seek not for power. \u2026 I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God.\u201d (Alma 60:36.)\nFor a final profile, I mention the mother of one noble missionary son. The family lived in the harsh climate of Star Valley, Wyoming. Summer there is brief and warm, while winter is long and cold. When a fine son of nineteen said farewell to home and family, he knew on whom the burden of work would fall. Father was ill and limited. To mother came the task of milking by hand the small dairy herd which sustained the family.\nWhile serving as a mission president, I attended a seminar for all presidents held in Salt Lake City. My wife and I were privileged to devote an evening to meeting the parents of those missionaries who served with us. Some parents were wealthy and handsomely attired. They spoke in a gracious manner. Their faith was strong. Others were less affluent, of modest means and rather shy. They, too, were proud of their special missionary and prayed and sacrificed for his welfare.\nOf all the parents whom I met that evening, the best remembered was that mother from Star Valley. As she took my hand in hers I felt the large calluses which revealed the manual labor she daily performed. Almost apologetically, she attempted to excuse her rough hands, her wind-whipped face. She whispered, \u201cTell our son Spencer that we love him, that we\u2019re proud of him, and that we pray daily for him.\u201d\nUntil that night I had never seen an angel nor heard an angel speak. I never again could make that statement, for that angel mother carried with her the Spirit of Christ. She, who with that same hand clasped in the hand of God had walked bravely into the valley of the shadow of death to bring to this mortal life her son, had indelibly impressed my life.\nNurtured and guided by such noble mothers, missionaries match the description of Helaman\u2019s throng:\n\u201cAnd they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all\u2014they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.\n\u201cYea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.\u201d (Alma 53:20\u201321.)\nSuch profiles prompt faith. They instill confidence. They teach truth. They testify of goodness. They help provide the answer to that question:\nShall the youth of Zion falter\nIn defending truth and right?\nWhile the enemy assaileth,\nShall [they] shrink or shun the fight?\n No!\nTrue to the faith that [their] parents have cherished,\nTrue to the truth for which martyrs have perished,\nTo God\u2019s command, Soul, heart, and hand,\nFaithful and true [they] will ever stand.\nMy sincere prayer is that we will stand with the youth of Zion, remain true to the faith, for which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nProfiles of Faith\n1978\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "As we approach the end of this morning of inspiration, I should like to take you, for a moment, back to that most dreadful night in and about Jerusalem when the Last Supper was concluded. Jesus and his disciples left the city and went over to the Mount of Olives. Knowing that his terrible ordeal was at hand, he spoke with those he loved. And he said to them: \u201cAll ye shall be offended [that is, shall fall away] because of me this night. \u2026\n\u201cPeter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.\n\u201cJesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\n\u201cPeter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.\u201d (Matt. 26:31, 33\u201336.)\nThere followed shortly thereafter the terrible agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, and then the betrayal. As the procession moved to the court of Caiaphas, \u201cPeter followed \u2026 unto the high priest\u2019s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end\u201d (Matt. 26:58).\nWhile the mockery of that trial was going on and Jesus\u2019 accusers spit on him, and buffeted him, and smote him with the palms of their hands, a damsel, seeing Peter, said: \u201cThou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.\n\u201cBut he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.\n\u201cAnd when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.\n\u201cAnd again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.\n\u201cAnd after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.\n\u201cThen began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.\n\u201cAnd Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.\u201d (Matt. 26:69\u201375; italics added.)\nWhat pathos there is in those words! Peter, affirming his loyalty, his determination, his resolution, said that he would never deny. But the fear of men came upon him and the weakness of his flesh overtook him, and under the pressure of accusation, his resolution crumbled. Then, recognizing his wrong and weakness, \u201che went out, and wept.\u201d\nAs I have read this account my heart goes out to Peter. So many of us are so much like him. We pledge our loyalty; we affirm our determination to be of good courage; we declare, sometimes even publicly, that come what may we will do the right thing, that we will stand for the right cause, that we will be true to ourselves and to others.\nThen the pressures begin to build. Sometimes these are social pressures. Sometimes they are personal appetites. Sometimes they are false ambitions. There is a weakening of the will. There is a softening of discipline. There is capitulation. And then there is remorse, self-accusation, and bitter tears of regret.\nOne of the great tragedies we witness almost daily is the tragedy of men of high aim and low achievement. Their motives are noble. Their proclaimed ambition is praiseworthy. Their capacity is great. But their discipline is weak. They succumb to indolence. Appetite robs them of will.\nI think of such a man I once knew, not a member of the Church. He was a graduate of a great university. His potential was unlimited. As a young man with an excellent education and a tremendous opportunity, he dreamed of the stars and moved in their direction. In the company which employed him in those early years, he was promoted from one responsibility to another, each with improved opportunity over the last. Before many years had passed, he was in the top echelon of his company. But those promotions brought him into the cocktail circuit. He could not handle it, as so many others cannot. He became an alcoholic, the victim of an appetite he could not control. He sought help but was too proud to discipline himself in the regimen imposed upon him by those who tried to assist him.\nHe went down like a falling star, tragically burning out and disappearing in the night. I made inquiry of one friend after another, and finally learned the truth of his tragic end. He, who had begun with such high aim and impressive talent, had died on skid row in one of our large cities. Like Peter of old he had felt certain of his strength and of his capacity to live up to his potential. But he had denied that capacity; and I am confident that as the shadows of his failure closed around him, again like Peter, he must have gone out and wept bitterly.\nI think of another. I knew him well. He joined the Church when long ago I was a missionary in the British Isles. He had a smoking habit. He prayed for strength in that springtime of his Church membership and the Lord answered his prayer and gave him power to overcome his habit. He looked to God and lived with a joy he never had previously known. But something happened. Family and social pressures were brought against him. He lowered his vision and gave way to his appetite. The smell of burning tobacco seduced him. I saw him some years later. We talked together of the old and better days he had known. And he, like Peter, wept bitterly. He blamed this and he blamed that, and, as he did so, I was inclined to repeat the words of Cassius\u2014\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\nAnd so I might continue telling you of those who begin with noble objectives, but then slow down, or of those who are strong starters and weak finishers. So many in the game of life get to first base, or second, or even third, but then fail to score. They are inclined to live unto themselves, denying their generous instincts, grasping for possessions and in their self-centered, uninspired living, sharing neither talent nor faith with others. Of them the Lord has said: \u201cAnd this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!\u201d (D&C 56:16).\nBut more particularly, I wish to say a word concerning those who, like Peter, profess love for the Lord and his work and then, either with voice or by silence, deny him.\nI recall so well a young man of great faith and devotion. He was my friend and my mentor during a sensitive period of my life. The manner of his living and the enthusiasm of his service were evidence of his love for the Lord and for the work of the Church. But he was slowly led away by the flattery of associates who saw in him the means of their own advancement in the affairs in which they were engaged together. Rather than lead them in the direction of his own faith and behavior, he slowly succumbed to their enticings in the opposite direction.\nHe never spoke in defiance of the faith he had lived by. That was not necessary. His altered manner was testimony enough of his having forsaken it. The years passed, and then I met him again. He spoke as one disillusioned. With lowered voice and lowered eyes, he told of his drifting when he cut himself loose from the anchor of his once-treasured faith. Then, concluding his narrative, like Peter, he wept.\nThe other day I was speaking with a friend concerning a mutual acquaintance, a man looked upon as highly successful in his vocation. \u201cBut what of his activity in the Church?\u201d I asked. To which my friend responded, \u201cHe knows in his heart that it is true, but he is afraid of it. He is fearful that if he were to acknowledge his Church membership and live its standards, he would be cut off from the social circle in which he moves.\u201d\nI reflected, \u201cLike Peter who denied his own sure knowledge, the day will come, though possibly not until old age, when in hours of quiet reflection this man will know that he traded his birthright for a mess of pottage (see Gen. 25:34); and there will be remorse and sorrow and tears, for he will come to see that he not only denied the Lord in his own life, but also in effect denied him before his children who have grown up without a faith to cling to.\u201d\nThe Lord himself said, \u201cWhosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels\u201d (Mark 8:38).\nNow, in conclusion, may I go back to Peter who denied and wept. Recognizing his error, repenting of his weakness, he turned about and became a mighty voice in bearing witness of the risen Lord. He, the senior apostle, dedicated the remainder of his life to testifying of the mission, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the living Son of the living God. He preached the moving sermon on the day of Pentecost when the multitude were touched in their hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost. In the authority of the priesthood received from his Master, he, with John, healed the lame man, the miracle that brought on persecution. He fearlessly spoke for his brethren when they were arraigned before the Sanhedrin. His was the vision that led to carrying the gospel to the Gentiles. (See Acts 2\u20134, Acts 10.)\nHe suffered chains and prison and a terrible martyr\u2019s death as a witness of Him who had called him from his nets to become a fisher of men (see Matt. 4:19). He remained faithful and true to the great and compelling trust given when the resurrected Lord in his final instructions to the eleven apostles charged them to go \u201cand teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Matt. 28:19). And he it was who, with James and John, came back to earth in this dispensation to restore the holy priesthood, under which divine authority the Church of Jesus Christ was organized in these latter days and under which same authority it now functions. These mighty works and many more unmentioned were done by Peter who once had denied and sorrowed, and then rose above that remorse to carry forward the work of the Savior following his ascension and to participate in the restoration of that work in this dispensation.\nNow, if there be any within the sound of my voice today who by word or act have denied the faith, I pray that you may draw comfort and resolution from the example of Peter who, though he had walked daily with Jesus, in an hour of extremity denied both the Lord and the testimony which he carried in his own heart. But he rose above this, and became a mighty defender and a powerful advocate. So too, there is a way for you to turn about, and add your strength and faith to the strength and faith of others in building the kingdom of God.\nThere sits in this hall today a man who grew up with love for the Church. But when he became involved in his business career, obsessed with ambition he began in effect to deny the faith. The manner of his living became almost a repudiation of his loyalty. Then fortunately, before he had gone too far, he heard the whisperings of the still, small voice. There came a saving sense of remorse. He turned around, and today he stands as the president of a great stake of Zion, while also serving as a senior officer in one of the leading industrial corporations of the nation and of the world.\nMy beloved brethren and sisters who may also have drifted, the Church needs you, and you need the Church. You will find many ears that will listen with understanding. There will be many hands to help you find your way back. There will be hearts to warm your own. There will be tears, not of bitterness but of rejoicing.\nMay the Lord touch you by the power of his Spirit to increase your desire. May he strengthen your resolution. May your joy be full and your peace sweet and satisfying as you return to that which you know in your heart is true, I humbly pray as I leave you my witness and testimony of him in whose name we serve, even the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon\u00a0B. Hinckley\nAnd Peter Went Out and Wept Bitterly\n1979\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "The Prophet Joseph Smith was often asked to inquire of the Lord to learn what people should do. In the case of John Whitmer, the Lord said, \u201cAnd now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father\u201d (D&C 15:6).\nJesus repeatedly called upon his disciples to preach the gospel to every living soul. Those who would believe were to be baptized in his name and enter into his church. After the Savior\u2019s forty-day fast and the temptation by Satan, \u201cJesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n\u201cAnd Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.\n\u201cAnd he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\n\u201cAnd they straightway left their nets, and followed him. \u2026\n\u201cAnd Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom\u201d (Matt. 4:17\u201320, 23).\nWith loving patience, Jesus taught his disciples, and especially his twelve Apostles, to \u201cpreach the kingdom of God\u201d (Luke 9:2). After the three years of his ministry, crowned by the Atonement, which included his glorious resurrection, Jesus gathered his eleven disciples in Galilee.\n\u201cAnd Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\n\u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\n\u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\u201d (Matt. 28:18\u201320).\nThese instructions were clear. When Peter, the chief Apostle, finally understood them, he became a powerful leader. For example, on the day of Pentecost, he stood \u201cwith the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, \u2026\n\u201cThis Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.\n\u201cTherefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.\n\u201cNow when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?\n\u201cThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. \u2026\n\u201cThen they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls\u201d (Acts 2:14, 32, 36\u201338, 41).\nWhen Jesus visited this continent, Nephi went forth and bowed himself before the Lord.\n\u201cAnd the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him.\n\u201cAnd the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.\n\u201cAnd again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize\u201d (3 Ne. 11:20\u201322).\nTo every people through all ages his message remains the same: \u201cPreach the kingdom of God\u201d (Luke 9:2).\nThe First Presidency has said that one of the threefold missions of the Church is to proclaim the gospel. If we accept this mission, we should be willing to center our efforts on bringing souls unto the Lord on condition of repentance.\nTwo years ago I spoke on this subject, and I continue to feel an urgent need that we must constantly remind and help each other in our responsibilities to share the message of the Restoration with others.\nWe often hear members say, \u201cI know I should share the gospel, but I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d Perhaps the following success stories that have come to me may help you. These experiences resulted when members of the Church exercised their faith and followed some simple steps, such as setting a date to have someone prepared to be taught by the missionaries.\nFrom England:\n\u201cIn my calling as branch president, I decided one day to invite our whole community to join us in fasting [and giving a fast offering] for the people of Ethiopia. I had 4,000 leaflets produced, which we distributed to homes in our area.\n\u201cOne of the leaflets was delivered to a nonmember, and he and his wife felt impressed to take part. It was the name of the Church on the leaflet which first impressed them.\n\u201cThe husband came to the chapel with the fast offering as invited, and I met him there. I gave him a tour of our small building, shared my testimony with him, and invited him to come to church Sunday. He came, and I introduced him to our missionaries, who arranged to call on the home.\n\u201cI was privileged to join with the missionaries on several joint teaching visits, and I developed a close relationship with the family.\n\u201cOn the evening of March 2, the night before the date I had set, I baptized the wife. Her husband will follow soon, and their daughter.\n\u201cWe have now met other families through this one, who are being taught. As for my wife and me, we have set another date!\u201d\nFrom Oregon:\n\u201cI set a date of just under two months and proceeded to ask for divine guidance in all of my daily prayers, and to fast for strength not to lose sight of my goal.\n\u201cMy date came and went, with a few pangs of guilt. However, I received a message one week later that an old friend of mine that I had gone to school with wanted me to call. I gave him a call and invited him over that night. My friend went with me to pick up some pizza. As we drove into town, I told him that I was a member of the LDS church. He was interested, so I related some of the many blessings I had received. I then asked him to attend church with me that next Sunday, which he did.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, he accepted it all. We invited him to be baptized. He said he didn\u2019t want to be rushed into anything. At this time, I was impressed to read to him from the Book of Mormon, using the words that Alma used at the waters of Mormon. As I read those verses from Mosiah 18 to him, I paused at each question that Alma asked and asked him if he were willing to do it also. He said yes to all of it. Then I read him verse 10 and asked him, \u2018What have you against being baptized?\u2019\n\u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018You\u2019re right, I have nothing to wait for.\u2019 So the date was set, and I baptized and confirmed him a member of the Church.\u201d\nFrom Florida:\n\u201cAs I knelt in prayer, I expressed a sincere desire to share the gospel with someone and asked my Heavenly Father to please send someone to me.\n\u201cThe very next morning there was a knock on my door, and it was a neighbor wanting to borrow a pan. Although she had lived by us for some time, we had not had much contact. Two days later both she and her husband came over to visit with us. During our conversation she mentioned that they had been looking for a church. I told her how my husband and I were once in that very same position and how our church filled that very special need we had. We invited them to church that Sunday, and they eagerly accepted. Afterward, we asked them if they would be interested in learning more by having the missionary lessons in our home. They told us that, indeed, they would be interested.\n\u201cOn Christmas Day, my husband baptized and confirmed them members of the Church. They have grown so strong, and they set a shining example to all. They are looking forward to the day when they and their new baby girl can be sealed in the temple for time and eternity.\u201d\nThen, from far-off Buenos Aires:\n\u201cIn our family prayers we began to include the names of nonmembers who had not yet joined the Church. My children prayed for them. Our prayers were different. We were changing our attitude toward missionary work from waiting for opportunities to share the gospel to asking the Lord to prepare specific people, by name, to receive the lessons.\n\u201cWe have seen one person come into the Church who is now fully active. Three other families, chosen with the Lord\u2019s help, have received the third discussion. All have been to church at least twice. All have been in our home for friendshipping and encouragement. They are receiving the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel message.\u201d\nMy brothers and sisters, from the experiences of these people and many more like them, we learn that we can give the saving ordinances of the gospel to others when we allow the Lord to help us with someone we know and love. Sharing our feelings about God and religion should be easy since most Latter-day Saints are loving, sharing, and trusting people. With a relationship of trust established and with help from the Lord, we generally can feel comfortable moving beyond the realm of friendship and can invite our friends to learn more about the Church.\nThere are many ways to share the gospel. I know that the following four simple steps will help you in your effort to find and to share the gospel with others because many members have used them and have had successful missionary experiences.\nStep one: Prayerfully set a date by which you will have someone prepared to hear the gospel. We must start somewhere, and this simple act of faith on our part will serve to motivate us. Do not worry if you do not have someone already in mind. Let the Lord help you.\nStep two: Prayerfully choose a friend or someone you already know, someone with whom you may have already discussed the gospel, or given a Book of Mormon or other Church literature, or taken to church.\nStep three: Share your date and your plans with your bishopric, ward mission leader, and the full-time missionaries. They will help you.\nThe most important step is step four: With the help of the Spirit, invite your nonmember friend to hear the missionary discussions. This step, extending an invitation to hear the gospel, requires the most faith\u2014faith to do as you are prompted by the Holy Ghost.\nIn talking of faith and saving souls, you should understand that when the Spirit is present, people are not offended when you share your feelings about the gospel. By prayerfully following these steps, you are putting a plan into effect that translates your faith into action.\nThere are many good ways that you can use to prepare someone to feel the Spirit. A few examples are: bear your testimony, pray together, read the scriptures, give a Book of Mormon, share a spiritual experience, take your friend to church, present a gospel film or tape, and discuss the gospel. Please note that all of these same steps and principles will also work when we use them to invite the inactive member of the Church to come back into full activity.\nIn the fiftieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are assured that \u201che that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth. \u2026\n\u201cWherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together\u201d (D&C 50:21\u201322).\nThe key to success in bringing souls unto Christ is to act at a time when you feel the Spirit and you sense that your friend does also.\nRemember, brothers and sisters, through our faith, our trust in the Lord, and our good works, we can bring many souls unto the Lord. We can enjoy the blessings of living with them in the kingdom of our Father.\nShortly after the death of Sister LeGrand Richards, I was assigned to be Elder Richards\u2019 junior companion to assist him in creating the Atlanta Georgia Stake. As we were flying toward his beloved Southern States Mission, he said to me, \u201cBrother Ballard, I am not afraid to die; the only thing I worry about is, will I be able to find Mommy over there.\u201d\nI was impressed to say to Elder Richards that in his case that could be a real problem. Immediately, I had his full attention. He looked me directly in the eye and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\nWith my emotions near the surface, I answered this great missionary, \u201cElder Richards, when you die, so many people there will be anxious to greet you because you introduced the gospel to them that you might have difficulty finding Mommy in the crowd.\u201d His response was, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\nWe all might ask ourselves the question, Who will be there to greet us?\nOh, that I could have the power to touch your hearts that you would have the faith to take the simple steps that will bring the light of the gospel to many more of our Father\u2019s children. The more I am involved in this work, the more I realize that Satan would have you and me believe that we cannot succeed in sharing the gospel. He lies to us. In fact, he is the father of all lies. Do not listen to him. Listen to the prompting of the Holy Ghost, and then act in faith in sharing the gospel.\nI testify to you, my brothers and sisters, that I know the Lord lives. I know that when we are willing to seek his help and guidance, when we trust in him completely, he will bless us to understand what to do and how to proceed in the wonderful work of sharing this glorious message with others.\nWe do appreciate all you have done in the past. The leaders of the Church have great faith that, united together, the members and the missionaries of this Church can do much more in the future to build the kingdom of God.\nMay the Lord bless us all with increased faith to move his work forward, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nM. Russell Ballard\nWe Proclaim the Gospel\n1986\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Early on in my service as a young missionary in Uruguay and Paraguay, I realized one of the great attractions to those seeking to know more about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was their interest in our doctrine regarding the family. In fact, since the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, truth-seeking investigators have been drawn to the doctrine that families can be together forever.\nThe principle of eternal families is an essential element in Heavenly Father\u2019s great plan for His children. Fundamental to that plan is the understanding that we have a heavenly family as well as an earthly family. The Apostle Paul teaches us that Heavenly Father is the father of our spirits:\n\u201cThat they should seek the Lord \u2026 and find him, \u2026\n\u201cFor in him we live, and move, and have our being; \u2026 For we are also his offspring.\u201d1\nBeing offspring of a loving Heavenly Father is such a basic principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ that even our children proclaim its truth as they sing the Primary song \u201cI Am a Child of God.\u201d Remember the words?\nI am a child of God,\nAnd he has sent me here,\nHas given me an earthly home\nWith parents kind and dear.\nLead me, guide me, walk beside me,\nHelp me find the way.\nTeach me all that I must do\nTo live with him someday.2\nRecognizing that we have a heavenly family helps us understand the eternal nature of our earthly families. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us that the family is fundamental to the order of heaven: \u201cAnd that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory.\u201d3\nUnderstanding the eternal nature of the family is a critical element in understanding Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for His children. The adversary, on the other hand, wants to do everything in his power to destroy Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. In his attempt to defeat God\u2019s plan, he is leading an unprecedented attack on the institution of the family. Some of the more powerful weapons he uses in his attack are selfishness, greed, and pornography.\nOur eternal happiness is not one of Satan\u2019s objectives. He knows that an essential key to making men and women miserable like himself is to deprive them of family relationships which have eternal potential. Because Satan understands that true happiness in this life and in the eternities is found in the form of family, he does everything in his power to destroy it.\nThe ancient prophet Alma calls God\u2019s plan for His children \u201cthe great plan of happiness.\u201d4 The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators, have offered us this inspired counsel with regard to happiness and family life: \u201cThe family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d5\nThis happiness spoken of by Alma and more recently by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles will most surely be found in the home with family. It will be found in abundance if we do everything in our power to establish a Christ-centered home.\nSister Maynes and I learned some important principles as we began the process of establishing a Christ-centered home early in our marriage. We started by following the counsel of our Church leaders. We brought our children together and held weekly family home evenings as well as daily prayer and scripture study. It was not always easy, convenient, or successful, but over time these simple gatherings became treasured family traditions.\nWe learned that our children might not remember everything about the family home evening lesson later in the week, but they would remember that we held it. We learned that later in the day at school they would probably not remember the exact words of the scriptures or the prayer, but they would remember that we did read scriptures and we did have prayer. Brothers and sisters, there is great power and protection for us and our youth in establishing celestial traditions in the home.\nLearning, teaching, and practicing the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our homes helps create a culture where the Spirit can dwell. Through establishing these celestial traditions in our homes, we will be able to overcome the false traditions of the world and learn to put the needs and concerns of others first.\nThe responsibility for establishing a Christ-centered home lies with both parents and children. Parents are responsible to teach their children in love and righteousness. Parents will be held accountable before the Lord in how they perform their sacred responsibilities. Parents teach their children with words and through example. This poem by C. C. Miller titled \u201cThe Echo\u201d illustrates the importance and impact parents have as they influence their children:\n\u2019Twas a sheep not a lamb\nThat strayed away in the parable Jesus told,\nA grown-up sheep that strayed away\nFrom the ninety and nine in the fold.\nAnd why for the sheep should we seek\nAnd earnestly hope and pray?\nBecause there is danger when sheep go wrong:\nThey lead the lambs astray.\nLambs will follow the sheep, you know,\nWherever the sheep may stray.\nWhen sheep go wrong,\nIt won\u2019t take long till the lambs are as wrong as they.\nAnd so with the sheep we earnestly plead\nFor the sake of the lambs today,\nFor when the sheep are lost\nWhat a terrible cost\nThe lambs will have to pay.6\nThe consequences to parents who lead their children astray are laid before us by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion \u2026 that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, \u2026 the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\u201d7\nIt is difficult to overstate the importance parents have in teaching their children celestial traditions through word and example. Children also play an important role in establishing a Christ-centered home. Let me share with you a short talk recently given by Will, my eight-year-old grandson, that illustrates this principle:\n\u201cI like to ride horses and go roping with my dad. A rope has different strands woven together to make it strong. If a rope had only one strand, it wouldn\u2019t be able to get the job done. But because there are more strands that work together, we are able to use it in many different ways and it is strong.\n\u201cFamilies can be like ropes. When only one person is working hard and doing what is right, the family will not be as strong as when everyone is putting forth the effort to help each other.\n\u201cI know that when I do what is right, I am helping my family. When I am treating my sister, Isabelle, nicely, we both have fun and it makes my mom and dad happy. If my mom needs to do something, I can help her by playing with my little brother, Joey. I also can help my family by keeping my room clean and helping out whenever I can with a good attitude. Since I am the oldest child in my family, I know being a good example is important. I can try my best to choose the right and follow the commandments.\n\u201cI know that kids can help their families be strong like a strong rope. When everyone does their best and works together, families can be happy and strong.\u201d\nWhen parents preside over the family in love and righteousness and teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ by word and through example, and when children love and support their parents by learning and practicing the principles their parents teach, the result will be the establishment of a Christ-centered home.\nBrothers and sisters, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we understand and believe in the eternal nature of the family. This understanding and belief should inspire us to do everything in our power to establish a Christ-centered home. I bear you my testimony that as we strive to do this, we will more fully practice the love and service that was exemplified through the life and Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and as a result, our homes can truly feel like heaven on earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard J. Maynes\nEstablishing a Christ-Centered Home\n2011\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Early in our marriage my wife, Mary, and I decided that to the extent possible we would choose activities that we could attend together. We also wanted to be prudent with our budget. Mary loves music and was undoubtedly concerned that I might overemphasize sporting events, so she negotiated that for all paid events, there would be two musicals, operas, or cultural activities for each paid ball game.\nInitially I was resistant to the opera component, but over time I changed my view. I particularly came to enjoy the operas by Giuseppe Verdi.1 This week will be the 200th anniversary of his birth.\nIn his youth Verdi was intrigued with the prophet Jeremiah, and in 1842, at the age of 28, he achieved fame with the opera Nabucco, a shortened Italian form of the name Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. This opera contains concepts drawn from the books of Jeremiah, Lamentations, and Psalms in the Old Testament. The opera includes the conquest of Jerusalem and the captivity and bondage of the Jews. Psalm 137 is the inspiration for Verdi\u2019s moving and inspiring \u201cChorus of the Hebrew Slaves.\u201d The heading of this psalm in our scriptures is very dramatic: \u201cWhile in captivity, the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylon\u2014Because of sorrow, they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion.\u201d\nMy purpose is to review many forms of bondage and subjugation. I will compare some circumstances of our day with those in the days of Jeremiah before the downfall of Jerusalem. In presenting this voice of warning, I am grateful that most Church members are righteously avoiding the conduct that was so offensive to the Lord in Jeremiah\u2019s time.\nThe prophecies and lamentations of Jeremiah are important to Latter-day Saints. Jeremiah and the Jerusalem of his day are the backdrop to the beginning chapters in the Book of Mormon. Jeremiah was a contemporary of the prophet Lehi.2 The Lord dramatically informed Jeremiah of his foreordination: \u201cBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\u201d3\nLehi had a different calling, mission, and assignment from the Lord. He was not called in his youth but in his maturity. Initially his was a voice of warning, but after faithfully declaring the same message as Jeremiah, Lehi was commanded by the Lord to take his family and depart into the wilderness.4 In doing so, Lehi blessed not only his family but also all people.\nDuring the years before the destruction of Jerusalem,5 the messages the Lord gave to Jeremiah are haunting. He said:\n\u201cMy people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed \u2026 out \u2026 broken cisterns, that can hold no water.\u201d6\nSpeaking of the calamities to come upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Lord lamented, \u201c[For them] the harvest is past, the summer is ended, and [they] are not saved.\u201d7\nGod intended that men and women would be free to make choices between good and evil. When evil choices become the dominant characteristic of a culture or nation, there are serious consequences both in this life and the life to come. People can become enslaved or put themselves in bondage not only to harmful, addictive substances but also to harmful, addictive philosophies that detract from righteous living.\nTurning from the worship of the true and living God and worshipping false gods like wealth and fame and engaging in immoral and unrighteous conduct result in bondage in all its insidious manifestations. These include spiritual, physical, and intellectual bondage and sometimes bring destruction. Jeremiah and Lehi also taught that those who are righteous must help the Lord establish His Church and kingdom and gather scattered Israel.8\nThese messages have echoed and been reinforced across the centuries in all dispensations. They are at the heart of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this, the final dispensation.\nThe captivity of the Jews and the scattering of the tribes of Israel, including the ten tribes, are prominent doctrinal factors in the Restoration of the gospel. The ten lost tribes made up the Northern Kingdom of Israel and were carried away captive into Assyria in 721 B.C. They went to the north countries.9 Our tenth article of faith states, \u201cWe believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes.\u201d10 We also believe that as part of the covenant the Lord made with Abraham, not only the lineage of Abraham would be blessed but also all the people of the earth would be blessed. As Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson has stated, the gathering \u201cis not a matter of physical location; it is a matter of individual commitment. People can be \u2018brought to the knowledge of the Lord\u2019 [3\u00a0Nephi 20:13] without leaving their homelands.\u201d11\nOur doctrine is clear: \u201cThe Lord scattered and afflicted the twelve tribes of Israel because of their unrighteousness and rebellion. However, the Lord also [utilized] this scattering of his chosen people among the nations of the world to bless those nations.\u201d12\nWe learn valuable lessons from this tragic period. We should do everything within our power to avoid the sin and rebellion that lead to bondage.13 We also recognize that righteous living is a prerequisite for assisting the Lord in gathering His elect and in the literal gathering of Israel.\nBondage, subjugation, addictions, and servitude come in many forms. They can be literal physical enslavement but can also be loss or impairment of moral agency that can impede our progress. Jeremiah is clear that unrighteousness and rebellion were the main reasons for the destruction of Jerusalem and captivity in Babylon.14\nOther kinds of bondage are equally destructive of the human spirit. Moral agency can be abused in many ways.15 I will mention four that are particularly pernicious in today\u2019s culture.\nFirst, addictions that impair agency, contradict moral beliefs, and destroy good health cause bondage. The impact of drugs and alcohol, immorality, pornography, gambling, financial subjugation, and other afflictions imposes on those in bondage and on society a burden of such magnitude that it is almost impossible to quantify.\nSecond, some addictions or predilections, while not inherently evil, can use up our precious allotment of time which could otherwise be used to accomplish virtuous objectives. These can include excessive use of social media, video and digital games, sports, recreation, and many others.16\nHow we preserve time for family is one of the most significant issues we face in most cultures. At a time when I was the only member of the Church in our law firm, one woman lawyer explained to me how she always felt like a juggler trying to keep three balls in the air at the same time. One ball was her law practice, one was her marriage, and one was her children. She had almost given up on time for herself. She was greatly concerned that one of the balls was always on the ground. I suggested we meet as a group and discuss our priorities. We determined that the primary reason we were working was to support our families. We agreed that making more money wasn\u2019t nearly as important as our families, but we recognized that serving our clients to the best of our abilities was essential. The discussion then moved to what we did at work that was not necessary and was inconsistent with leaving time for family. Was there pressure to spend time in the workplace that was not essential?17 We decided that our goal would be a family-friendly environment for both women and men. Let us be at the forefront in protecting time for family.\nThird, the most universal subjugation in our day, as it has been throughout history, is ideology or political beliefs that are inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Substituting the philosophies of men for gospel truth can lead us away from the simplicity of the Savior\u2019s message. When the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he tried to teach of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Of this effort we read in Acts, \u201cFor all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.\u201d18 When the crowd realized the simple religious nature of Paul\u2019s message, which was not new, they rejected it.\nThis is emblematic of our own day, where gospel truths are often rejected or distorted to make them intellectually more appealing or compatible with current cultural trends and intellectual philosophies. If we are not careful, we can be captured by these trends and place ourselves in intellectual bondage. There are many voices now telling women how to live.19 They often contradict each other. Of particular concern are philosophies that criticize or diminish respect for women who choose to make the sacrifices necessary to be mothers, teachers, nurturers, or friends to children.\nA few months ago our two youngest granddaughters visited us\u2014one each week. I was at home and answered the door. My wife, Mary, was in another room. In both cases, after a hug, they said almost the same thing. They looked around and then said, \u201cI love to be in Grandma\u2019s house. Where is Grandma?\u201d I didn\u2019t say it to them, but I was thinking, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Grandpa\u2019s house too?\u201d But I realized that when I was a boy, our family went to Grandma\u2019s house. The words of a familiar song came into my mind: \u201cOver the river and through the woods to Grandmother\u2019s house we go.\u201d\nNow, let me say unequivocally that I am thrilled with the educational and other opportunities that are available to women. I treasure the fact that the backbreaking work and domestic drudgery required of women has been reduced in much of the world because of modern conveniences and that women are making such magnificent contributions in every field of endeavor. But if we allow our culture to reduce the special relationship that children have with mothers and grandmothers and others who nurture them, we will come to regret it.\nFourth, forces that violate sincerely held religious principles can result in bondage. One of the most invidious forms is when righteous people who feel accountable to God for their conduct are forced into activities that violate their conscience\u2014for example, health providers forced to choose between assisting with abortions against their consciences or losing their jobs.\nThe Church is a relatively small minority even when linked with people who are like-minded. It will be hard to change society at large, but we must work to improve the moral culture that surrounds us. Latter-day Saints in every country should be good citizens, participate in civic affairs, educate themselves on the issues, and vote.\nOur primary emphasis, however, should always be to make any necessary sacrifices to protect our own family and the rising generation.20 The vast majority of them are not yet in bondage to serious addictions or false ideologies. We must help inoculate them from a world that sounds a lot like the Jerusalem that Lehi and Jeremiah experienced. In addition, we need to prepare them to make and keep sacred covenants and to be the principal emissaries to help the Lord establish His Church and gather scattered Israel and the Lord\u2019s elect everywhere.21 As the Doctrine and Covenants beautifully reads, \u201cThe righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy.\u201d22\nOur challenge is to avoid bondage of any kind, help the Lord gather His elect, and sacrifice for the rising generation. We must always remember that we do not save ourselves. We are liberated by the love, grace, and atoning sacrifice of the Savior. When Lehi\u2019s family fled, they were led by the Lord\u2019s light. If we are true to His light, follow His commandments, and rely on His merits, we will avoid spiritual, physical, and intellectual bondage as well as the lamentation of wandering in our own wilderness, for He is mighty to save.\nLet us avoid the despair and sorrow of those who fall into captivity and can no longer bear to sing the songs of Zion. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Quentin\u00a0L.

We\u2019d talk about the desire to be popular and the influence of friends and the importance of families and good times. Maybe you would tell me about when you have felt discouraged or disappointed, confused, maybe afraid.\nI think of questions young women have asked me. \u201cHow do I stay close to the Lord?\u201d \u201cCan I make it?\u201d \u201cIs there a way back?\u201d In answer to those questions, I raise my voice and say with all the fervor of my soul, \u201cYou can feel a closeness to your Heavenly Father. You can make it, no matter how tough the test.\u201d And to some I\u2019d say with the deepest conviction, \u201cYes, there is a way back\u2014come back.\u201d\nI would tell you how searching the holy scriptures can answer every question you may ever have in life. I remember a difficult time in my life when I thought I couldn\u2019t make it. I had failed a grade in school. It was awful. I just remember praying with all my heart that I could be smart. Some time after that I became aware that the scriptures could provide answers when I needed help. I\u2019d like to share with you one scripture that really helped me during that time in my life.\n\u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\n\u201cIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\u201d (Prov. 3:5\u20136.)\nYou might think that I never lack confidence now, but I do sometimes. And when I feel that way, I reread that scripture, and I can feel His love and know He is near.\nYou might wonder how this happens. Maybe you\u2019re like many young people and some older people\u2014you find the scriptures boring, or they don\u2019t have much meaning to you. If so, you haven\u2019t yet put forth the time and effort and faith to learn to understand them and love them. Learning to love the scriptures is a lot like learning to walk. At first you\u2019re unsure\u2014you sometimes stumble, and you don\u2019t get anywhere very fast. But if you stopped trying to walk and gave up, just because it wasn\u2019t fun at first, you\u2019d never know the joy of walking. But as you persist, you learn how to walk; soon you can run and go places where you couldn\u2019t go before.\nLearning to study the scriptures is like learning to walk. When you first begin reading them, you feel unsure; you\u2019d much rather read something familiar, like a favorite story. But I can tell you from my experience, if you will try reading the scriptures every day, just as you kept trying to walk, these precious records will become as important to you as being able to walk. In fact, I believe more so. Every day will go better for you. Your confidence will grow, and you will find the strength to resist temptation and discouragement. But you have got to begin. So if you haven\u2019t already, will you start tonight by marking a favorite scripture before you go to bed? If you don\u2019t have a favorite one, you could mark the one I shared from Proverbs, chapter 3, verses 5 and 6, and put today\u2019s date beside it as a reminder of our visit tonight. [Prov. 3:5\u20136]\nYou might start by reading the chapter headnotes to get the feel of the story. The headnote to chapter one in Third Nephi in the book of Mormon reads, in part, \u201cThe night of Christ\u2019s birth arrives\u2014The sign is given and a new star arises.\u201d You\u2019re already familiar with that miraculous event, and by reading this chapter you can be comfortably on your way\u2014a first step which can lead to many more each day.\nI want to share with you an experience I had this summer. I spent three days in a wilderness camp with 150 youth. We did a lot of hiking and had some hard physical challenges like when we rappelled down an eighty-foot cliff. On the last day we were given instructions to go into the woods alone. Before leaving the group, each youth was given a letter from home which had been written by his or her mother or father for this occasion.\nWhen I went out alone, I took my scriptures with me. I read about my Father in Heaven\u2019s love for all of us and for me. It was then that I realized that these scriptures are like letters from home.\nAfter a time we gathered together. Everyone had opened and read his or her letter. One young woman stood expressing the feelings of her heart. She held her letter close. In her words, \u201cI nearly bawled my face off when I sat there alone and realized how much my mom and dad love me.\u201d I nearly bawled my face off when I read again about how very much our Father in Heaven loves us.\nCan you imagine being away from home and receiving a letter from your parents and not bothering to open it or read it? This is what happens when we don\u2019t read these precious records. The holy scriptures are like letters from home telling us how we can draw near to our Father in Heaven. He tells us to come as we are. No one will be denied. He loves everyone. (See 3 Ne. 9:14, 17\u201318.)\nI ask you, will you open your scriptures and read them every day? Why? Because the glorious promises will then be yours. You can have a sure testimony of our Father in Heaven\u2019s love for you. You can know the gospel plan and the blessings that come through obedience and right choices. The verses you mark will become anchors to cling to when the voices of the world try to confuse you or discourage you. They will lift you up in spirit when you\u2019re down, and you can experience the feeling of being close to our Father in Heaven. I know this, but I\u2019d like you to hear from a young woman who has made a habit of reading the scriptures. I\u2019ve asked Gail Gardner to tell you how it works for her.\nGail: I read them because there are a whole lot of good things that have come out of scripture reading for me. The times when I feel like I really know and understand my Heavenly Father and what He wants for me have almost always been those times when I\u2019m reading the scriptures.\nSister Kapp: Do you have a favorite scripture, Gail?\nGail: Yes. One that has really helped me is found in the Book of Mormon in Mosiah 4:27. It talks about man not having the need to run faster than he has strength, but that if he will be diligent, all things will come to him. That scripture helps me because I\u2019ve always been really busy.\nA specific incident with that scripture happened just a very little while ago. I was preparing to compete in a big speech tournament and was facing college entrance exams. I\u2019d just been called to serve on our seminary council and was worried about responsibilities there. I also have one brother and six sisters whom I really care about, and I wanted to spend time with them. I read through that scripture and others like it which said that all I needed to do was to set a pace for myself and keep up with it. I felt that my Father in Heaven had answered my prayers in that scripture.\nSister Kapp: Gail, how have you made scripture study a habit?\nGail: I try to keep in mind three things. First, I\u2019ve found that ten minutes of serious studying and concentration every day is much more meaningful and worthwhile to me than an hour of \u201churried\u201d reading once a week.\nSecond, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s easier for me to make scripture reading a habit if I do it for a certain length of time and at a specific time of day, if at all possible. For me, it works best to read at least ten minutes a day, and I usually do that right after my prayers, before I go to bed. Some days are hard, and reading the scriptures every day helps me feel closer to my Father in Heaven and makes it easier to do what\u2019s right.\nLast of all, I\u2019d say that scripture reading and prayer go hand in hand. A lot of times I don\u2019t understand a scripture, but the feeling I get when I\u2019m studying, reading, and praying can often bring answers to all kinds of questions and doubts.\nSister Kapp: How do you feel about having your own set of scriptures?\nGail: I love them. These scriptures that I have marked and studied have helped to increase my testimony so much. I\u2019m only seventeen, but the principles and guidelines of the gospel that I understand and have learned to obey have really brought me closer to my Father in Heaven. From my study of His scriptures, I know that they are true.\nSister Kapp: Thank you, Gail, for your strong testimony. I know that they are true, too.\nTo you young women everywhere, will you make a commitment tonight to make a habit of reading your letters from home\u2014your scriptures\u2014more frequently? If you will ask your Heavenly Father in daily prayers to help you understand the messages and find answers to your problems or questions, and if you will strive to keep the commandments, you can have the spirit of the Holy Ghost to teach you and to open your mind more than you would ever have thought possible. These are special messages that are there for you for your individual needs at this particular time in your life.\nOften while you\u2019re studying you will feel very close to your Heavenly Father, and so you will want to have your scriptures with you. I have this small size so I can carry them with me most of the time. You already carry your schoolbooks; will you carry your scriptures? Make it the thing to do. If you will, others will follow your example. You\u2019ll discover important friends that will be excited to share with you scriptures that are special to them. I have a friend who often calls me on the phone and says, \u201cHave you got your scriptures there?\u201d With excitement in her voice, she\u2019ll say, \u201cLet me share with you what I\u2019ve found.\u201d Then she reads it to me, and I say, \u201cWhere did you find that? What\u2019s the reference?\u201d Then I get excited, and I mark my scriptures.\nBut I had to learn to walk first. As you keep trying, sooner than you realize, you\u2019ll have a few favorite scriptures marked that you can easily turn to. And you\u2019ll learn to love these books like special friends. If you do not have your own set of scriptures, make a plan to get them.\nLet me tell you about this old set that my mom and dad gave me when I was seventeen. I had read the Book of Mormon before, but this time it was different. I was young, and I wanted to know for myself if the Book of Mormon was really true. On this day I had come to the part in Alma, chapter 32, [Alma 32] about faith. As I finished the chapter, I experienced a feeling which I recognized as a witness from the Holy Ghost\u2014I knew the Book of Mormon was true. I wanted to stand up and shout. I wanted to tell the whole world what I knew and how I felt, but I was alone. So with tears of joy streaming down my face, I wrote on the margin all the way around on each side the feelings in my heart at that moment. I made a big red star up in the corner and wrote, \u201cMay 31st, 7:30 A.M. This I know, written as if to me.\u201d Then I wrote on the other margin, \u201cI have received a confirmation. I know the Book of Mormon is true.\u201d On the other side I wrote, \u201cOne month ago today I began fasting each Tuesday for a more sure knowledge. This I know.\u201d\nThrough prayer and study you can know the scriptures are true. I am so anxious for you to know and love the scriptures so they can provide answers during your teenage years when the climb is steep and scary and risky and you need inspiration as you make important choices every day. As you become more and more familiar with the scriptures, they can eventually become your favorite stories, easy to read; and they will help you have determination to stand firm for righteousness, even when it\u2019s hard.\nAfter this conference, will you join with me in making a renewed commitment to increase your scripture study on a regular basis? Will you make a plan to have a set of your own scriptures to keep close and carry with you? Will every one of you within the sound of my voice accept the invitation, the challenge, to make a commitment to read the scriptures this year regularly? If you will do this, I promise you, and bear my witness, that our Father in Heaven will draw near to you because you will be drawing near to Him. (See D&C 88:63.) We live and will one day die. And when we do, we will know our Savior, for we will have searched the holy scriptures and felt His nearness as He walks with us on our journey home. To this I bear my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nArdeth G. Kapp\nThe Holy Scriptures:Letters from Home\n1985\nGeneral Women's Meeting\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 5:02 PM\nBrigham Young\nBrigham Young\nEarly Life, Conversion, and Apostleship\nBrigham Young was born in Vermont in 1801 as the ninth of 11 siblings.\nHe grew up in a family that relocated multiple times searching for a\nstable living. His parents insisted on strict obedience to the Bible and\nindividual industriousness in each of their children. Brigham left home\nat the age of 16, two years after his mother\u2019s death from tuberculosis.\nHe was introduced to the Book of Mormon soon after the book\u2019s 1830\npublication but studied the gospel for two years before accepting\nbaptism. He learned quickly to support the prophet in \u201cpatience and\nfaith\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants 21:5) after hearing of Joseph Smith\u2019s\nvision of the degrees of glory, which seemed to run contrary to\nBrigham\u2019s view of the resurrection. He embraced the revelation and\nencouraged others to do the same. 1\nBrigham marched to Missouri with the Camp of Israel (later called\n\u201cZion\u2019s Camp\u201d) 2 in 1834, and shortly after the Camp\u2019s return to\nKirtland, Ohio, he was called to serve as an Apostle in the Quorum of\nthe Twelve. In 1837, when several leaders, including Apostles, rejected\nJoseph Smith\u2019s leadership in Kirtland, Brigham rallied supporters to\nprotect the Church and sustain the Prophet. After Thomas B. Marsh\nresigned from the Twelve, Brigham succeeded Marsh as president of the\nquorum and played a key role in leading the Saints to refuge during the\npersecutions in Missouri. 3 The following year, Brigham left with other\nApostles on a mission to Britain, where he fostered unity in the Quorum\nof the Twelve and helped bring thousands of converts into the Church.\nIn Nauvoo, Brigham was among the first to receive the newly revealed\ntemple endowment. 4 After Joseph Smith taught him about plural\nmarriage, Brigham, with his wife Mary Ann\u2019s consent, married Lucy\nAnn Decker in 1842. 5 In early 1844 he joined the Council of Fifty, a\ngroup tasked with finding settlement destinations for the Latter-day\nSaints. 6\nIn 1844, while campaigning for Joseph Smith\u2019s candidacy for president\nof the United States, Brigham learned that Joseph and Hyrum Smith\nhad been assassinated. 7 He left immediately for Nauvoo, arriving in\nAugust and meeting with other Church leaders to determine a way\nforward. In a general meeting of the Saints, he proposed that the\nTwelve should lead the Church as a quorum, a motion those assembled\nsustained almost unanimously. 8 Brigham also emphasized the need to\nfinish the Nauvoo Temple before the Saints left the city. After the\ntemple\u2019s partial dedication in December 1845, he oversaw the ordinance\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/brigham-young?lang=eng\n1/64/8/23, 5:02 PM\nBrigham Young\nwork of thousands of Saints in the temple, often administered in long\nand arduous shifts, before leaving the city for the West. 9 In 1847 he\nreceived a revelation (later canonized as Doctrine and Covenants 136)\nreiterating how leaders should organize the Saints\u2019 exodus and guided a\nvanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley that same year. 10 That\nDecember, after returning to Iowa, Brigham reorganized the First\nPresidency at Kanesville, Iowa, with Heber C. Kimball and Willard\nRichards as his counselors. 11\nProphet on the Frontier\nUnder Brigham Young\u2019s administration, the Saints worked together to\nbuild settlements in the unfamiliar Great Basin landscape. 12 In\nadapting to their environment, the Saints deepened their commitment\nto a distinctive, communal culture, endured a famine, and founded\nmany communities along a corridor stretching from Mexico and\nsouthern California to Idaho and Canada. Brigham displayed an\nunprecedented vision for organizing communities, sustaining ever-\nchanging frontier economies, and accommodating a constant stream of\nimmigrants. Through it all, he maintained a focus on the unifying\nobjective of building Zion. 13 \u201cI have Zion in my view constantly,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe are not going to wait for angels, or for Enoch and his\ncompany to come and build up Zion, but we are going to build it.\u201d 14\nWhile he could be outspoken and sharp at times, his fellow Saints\nremembered him as an attentive, beloved leader who cared for their\ninterests. 15\nBrigham hoped to promote peace with the American Indian groups in\nthe region. At times, however, Latter-day Saints contended with them,\nand Brigham expressed regret at the way these conflicts unfolded. 16 He\nwas serving as Territorial Governor in Utah in 1857\u201358 when the United\nStates government dispatched troops to suppress supposed lawlessness\namong Latter-day Saints in Utah. 17 During the hysteria that preceded\nthe arrival of the U.S. army, some Latter-day Saints massacred a party of\nmigrants passing through Utah Territory at Mountain Meadows. 18\nThough the fiery rhetoric he and other leaders had engaged in likely\ncontributed to the climate of hostility leading up to the tragedy,\nBrigham had instructed Saints to leave the migrants alone. 19\nWhile his attention was often focused on the struggles of Utah Saints,\nBrigham Young was mindful of his prophetic responsibility to the\nworld. He issued calls for missionaries to serve in continental Europe,\nAfrica, Asia, and South America. 20 Before his death, all or most of the\nBook of Mormon was published in Danish, French, Welsh, German,\nItalian, Hawaiian, Swedish, and Spanish. Brigham worked beyond\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/brigham-young?lang=eng\n2/64/8/23, 5:02 PM\nBrigham Young\ncertain cultural barriers of the time as he helped migrants from many\ndifferent ethnic and language groups gather to Utah Territory and\nestablish homes among their fellow Saints. 21\nFamily Life\nBrigham Young married his first wife, Miriam Works, in New York in\n1824. A few months after they were both baptized, Miriam died of\ntuberculosis. Brigham\u2019s second wife, Mary Ann Angell, helped raise\nMiriam\u2019s children as well as her own, cared for their household alone\nduring Brigham\u2019s frequent absences on missions, and accepted plural\nmarriage when introduced to the principle.\nThough initially apprehensive, Brigham Young quickly became a strong\nadvocate for the practice of plural marriage. Toward the end of his life,\nBrigham was widely known as the father of a large plural family. He was\nsealed to over 50 women, many but not all of whom lived with him.\nSome likely understood their sealing to Brigham as having spiritual\nrather than domestic significance. Brigham and 16 of his wives had a\ntotal of 56 children. As parents, they developed new traditions to\nmanage the large family. 22 Two of his wives were later Relief Society\nGeneral Presidents: Eliza R. Snow and Zina D. Huntington Jacobs. 23\nMany of Brigham\u2019s children, as well as orphans taken into the family,\nrecorded fond memories of his paternal presence and influence in their\nlives.\nChanges to the Church\u2019s Organization\nDuring the last decade of his life, Brigham Young introduced numerous\nchanges to Church organization. In 1867 Brigham called for women to\nrevive the Relief Society and launch groups in each ward. The same\nyear, he organized a general board to oversee local Sunday Schools. In\n1869, with the help of his wives and daughters, he promoted a\nretrenchment movement, which soon led to the creation of a larger\norganization for young women. 24 Progress on the Salt Lake Temple\nmoved slowly, and in the 1870s he directed construction on a temple in\nSt. George and planned other temples for Manti and Logan. 25 As the\nSt. George temple neared completion in 1877, Brigham worked with\nothers to commit temple ordinances to writing for the first time to\nensure temple work could continue after his death as he had envisioned.\nAmong his final acts as Church President, Brigham Young streamlined\nthe responsibilities and relationships of priesthood quorums and\ndedicated the St. George temple. He passed away on August 29, 1877, at\n76 years of age.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/brigham-young?lang=eng\n3/64/8/23, 5:02 PM\nBrigham Young\nChurch Resources\n\u201cBrigham Young,\u201d Prophets of the Restoration, history.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nRonald K.

Our daughter was the designated teacher and our son-in-law the designated enforcer, doing their best to maintain a sense of calm amidst occasional chaos in order to teach gospel principles to the children.\nDuring one especially rough class, after a number of warnings to an energetic little boy, our son-in-law escorted the four-year-old out of the classroom. Once outside the room, and about to talk to the little boy about his behavior and the need to find his parents, the little boy stopped our son-in-law before he could say a word and, with his hand up in the air, and with great emotion, blurted out, \u201cSometimes\u2014sometimes\u2014it\u2019s just hard for me to think about Jesus!\u201d\nIn our journey through mortality, as glorious as our intended destination may be and as exhilarating as the journey may prove, we will all be subject to trials and sorrow along the way. Elder Joseph\u00a0B. Wirthlin taught: \u201cThe dial on the wheel of sorrow eventually points to each of us. At one time or another, everyone must experience sorrow. No one is exempt.\u201d1 \u201cThe Lord in His wisdom does not shield anyone from grief or sadness.\u201d2 However, our ability to travel this road in peace is, in large part, dependent on whether or not we too have a hard time thinking about Jesus.\nPeace of mind, peace of conscience, and peace of heart are not determined by our ability to avoid trials, sorrow, or heartache. Despite our sincere pleas, not every storm will change course, not every infirmity will be healed, and we may not fully understand every doctrine, principle, or practice taught by prophets, seers, and revelators. Nevertheless, we have been promised peace\u2014with a condition attached.\nIn the Gospel of John, the Savior taught that despite the tribulations of life, we can be of good cheer, we can be of good hope, and we need not fear, because He declared, \u201cIn me ye might have peace.\u201d3 Faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice is, and forever will be, the first principle of the gospel and the foundation upon which our hope for \u201cpeace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come\u201d is built.4\nIn our search for peace amidst the daily challenges of life, we\u2019ve been given a simple pattern to keep our thoughts focused on the Savior, who said: \u201cLearn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me. I am Jesus Christ.\u201d5\nLearn, listen, and walk\u2014three steps with a promise.\nFirst Step: \u201cLearn of Me\u201d\nIn Isaiah we read, \u201cAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways.\u201d6\nIn the ever-increasing number of temples dotting the earth, we learn of Jesus Christ and His role in the Father\u2019s plan as the Creator of this world, as our Savior and Redeemer, and as the source of our peace.\nPresident Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught: \u201cThe world can be a challenging and difficult place in which to live. \u2026 As you and I go to the holy houses of God, as we remember the covenants we make within, we will be more able to bear every trial and to overcome each temptation. In this sacred sanctuary we will find peace.\u201d7\nDuring a stake conference assignment a few years ago while serving in South America, I met a couple that was grieving the recent death of their infant son.\nIt was in an interview during the course of the conference that I first met with Brother Tumiri and learned of his loss. As we spoke, he shared that not only was he deeply saddened by the death of his son, but he was also devastated at the thought of never seeing him again. He explained that as relatively new members of the Church, they had saved enough money to attend the temple just one time, prior to the birth of their little boy, where they had been sealed as a couple and had their two daughters sealed to them. He then described how they had been saving money for a return trip to the temple but hadn\u2019t yet been able to take their little boy in order to be sealed to him as well.\nRecognizing a possible misunderstanding, I explained that he would indeed see his son again, if he remained faithful, because the sealing ordinance that had bound him to his wife and daughters was also sufficient to bind him to his son, who had been born in the covenant.\nAmazed, he asked if this was really true, and when I confirmed that it was, he then asked if I would be willing to speak with his wife, who had been inconsolable during the two weeks since their son\u2019s death.\nSunday afternoon, following the conference, I met with Sister Tumiri and explained this glorious doctrine to her as well. With the pain of her loss still fresh, but now with a glimmer of hope, she tearfully asked, \u201cWill I really be able to hold my little boy in my arms again? Is he really mine forever?\u201d I assured her that as she kept her covenants, the sealing power found in the temple, effective because of the authority of Jesus Christ, would indeed allow her to be with her son again and hold him in her arms.\nSister Tumiri, though heartbroken by the death of her son, left our meeting with tears of gratitude and filled with peace because of the sacred ordinances of the temple, made possible by our Savior and Redeemer.\nEach time we attend the temple\u2014in all that we hear, do, and say; in every ordinance in which we participate; and in every covenant that we make\u2014we are pointed to Jesus Christ. We feel peace as we hear His words and learn from His example. President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley taught, \u201cGo to the house of the Lord and there feel of His Spirit and commune with Him and you will know a peace that you will find nowhere else.\u201d8\nSecond Step: \u201cListen to My Words\u201d\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants we read, \u201cWhether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.\u201d9 From the days of Adam and down through the ages to our current prophet, Thomas Spencer Monson, the Lord has spoken through His authorized representatives. Those who choose to listen and give heed to the words of the Lord, as delivered through His prophets, will find safety and peace.\nIn the Book of Mormon we find many examples of the importance of following prophetic counsel and standing with the prophet, including a lesson learned from Lehi\u2019s vision of the tree of life, found in 1\u00a0Nephi chapter\u00a08. Never has the great and spacious building been more crowded or the noise coming from its open windows more misguided, mocking, and confusing than in our day. In this passage we read of two groups of people and their responses to the shouts from the building.\nBeginning in verse\u00a026, we read:\n\u201cAnd I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cAnd it was filled with people, \u2026 and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come \u2026 and were partaking of the fruit.\n\u201cAnd after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.\u201d10\nIn verse\u00a033 we read of others who had a different response to the scoffing and mocking coming from the building. The prophet Lehi explains that those in the building \u201cdid point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.\u201d11\nA key difference between those who were ashamed, fell away, and were lost and those who did not heed the mocking from the building and stood with the prophet is found in two phrases: first, \u201cafter they had tasted,\u201d and second, \u201cthose that were partaking.\u201d\nThe first group had arrived at the tree, stood for a time with the prophet, but only tasted the fruit. By not continuing to eat, they allowed the taunting from the building to affect them, drawing them away from the prophet and into forbidden paths, where they were lost.\nIn contrast to those who tasted and wandered off were those who were found continuously partaking of the fruit. These individuals ignored the commotion from the building, stood by the prophet, and enjoyed the accompanying safety and peace. Our commitment to the Lord and His servants cannot be a part-time commitment. If so, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who seek to destroy our peace. As we listen to the Lord through His authorized servants, we stand in holy places and cannot be moved.\nThe adversary offers counterfeit solutions that may appear to provide answers but take us even further from the peace we seek. He offers a mirage that has the appearance of legitimacy and safety but ultimately, like the great and spacious building, will collapse, destroying all who seek peace within its walls.\nTruth is found in the simplicity of a Primary song: \u201cWords of a prophet: Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace.\u201d12\nThird Step: \u201cWalk in the Meekness of My Spirit\u201d\nHowever far we may wander from the path, the Savior invites us to return and walk with Him. This invitation to walk with Jesus Christ is an invitation to accompany Him to Gethsemane and from Gethsemane to Calvary and from Calvary to the Garden Tomb. It is an invitation to observe and apply His great atoning sacrifice, whose reach is as individual as it is infinite. It is an invitation to repent, to draw upon His cleansing power, and to grasp His loving, outstretched arms. It is an invitation to be at peace.\nWe have all felt, at some time in our lives, the pain and heartache associated with sin and transgression, for \u201cif we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\u201d13 However, \u201cthough [our] sins be as scarlet,\u201d as we apply the Atonement of Jesus Christ and walk with Him through sincere repentance, \u201cthey shall be as white as snow.\u201d14 Though we have been weighed down with guilt, we shall obtain peace.\nAlma the Younger was compelled to confront his sins when visited by an angel of the Lord. He described his experience in these words:\n\u201cMy soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0Yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.\u201d15\nAs serious as his sins were, and in the midst of this ordeal, he continues:\n\u201cI remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\n\u201c\u2026\u00a0I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.\u201d16\n\u201cAnd never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.\u201d17\nLike Alma, we too will find peace to our souls as we walk with Jesus Christ, repent of our sins, and apply His healing power in our lives.\nThe peace we all seek requires more than a desire. It requires us to act\u2014by learning of Him, by listening to His words, and by walking with Him. We may not have the ability to control all that happens around us, but we can control how we apply the pattern for peace that the Lord has provided\u2014a pattern that makes it easy to think often about Jesus.\nI testify that Jesus Christ is \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life\u201d18 and that only through Him can we obtain true peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Bishop W.\u00a0Christopher Waddell\nA Pattern for Peace\n2016\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Who is he who is called Jesus the Christ? Do you know him?\nWhen he was praying to the Father, just prior to his crucifixion, he said:\n\u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d (John 17:3.)\nIn that council in heaven, the plan and purpose of this earth life was explained to all the spirits, and then \u201cthe Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.\u201d (Abr. 3:27.)\nHe who was selected was Jehovah, the oldest, who had promised that in going he would honor the Father and give him all the glory.\nThe Father has declared: \u201cThis is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d (Moses 1:39.)\nJehovah was, then, under the direction of the Father, the creator of this earth and many other worlds. Moses was shown in vision \u201cmany lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.\u201d (Moses 1:29.) God declared to Moses; \u201cBy the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.\n\u201cAnd worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.\u201d (Moses 1:32\u201333.)\nTo get some idea of the magnitude of these creations: President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said, \u201cAstronomers now yield what they did not formerly yield, that there may have been many, and probably were, many worlds like ours. Some say there were in this galaxy perhaps from its beginning, one million worlds like unto this one.\n\u201c\u2018Worlds without number have I created,\u2019 through \u2018mine Only Begotten Son.\u2019 I repeat, our Lord is not a novice, he is not an amateur; he has been over this course time and time and time again.\n\u201cAnd if you think of this galaxy of ours having within it from the beginning perhaps until now, one million worlds, and multiply that by the number of millions of galaxies, one hundred million galaxies, that surround us, you will then get some view of who this Man we worship is.\u201d (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Behold the Lamb of God, Deseret Book Company, 1962, pp. 16\u201317.)\nHe was truly no novice, no amateur, in the art or skill of a creator. \u201cWorlds without number\u201d he has created.\nIt was he, then, who came to this earth in the meridian of time, born of the virgin Mary\u2014the literal Son of God the Father, \u201cthe Only Begotten Son.\u201d\nHe declared who he was. Throughout his life on earth, he repeatedly declared that he was the Son of God. At the age of twelve, he was found \u201cin the temple\u201d conversing with the \u201cdoctors.\u201d In answer to his mother\u2019s reproof, he said, \u201cWist ye not that I must be about my Father\u2019s business?\u201d (Luke 2:49.)\nAt the baptism of Jesus by John, as also at the transfiguration of Jesus, a voice from heaven declared, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d (Matt. 3:17, Matt. 17:5.)\nWhen Jesus was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, \u201cMartha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\n\u201cJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\n\u201cAnd whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?\n\u201cShe saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.\u201d (John 11:24\u201327.)\nOn another occasion, when Jesus stopped at Jacob\u2019s well, he asked a Samaritan woman to draw water for him, and, in the conversation that followed, the Samaritan woman said to Jesus, \u201cI know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.\n\u201cJesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.\u201d (John 4:25\u201326.)\nThen again:\n\u201cWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n\u201cAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias: and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\n\u201cHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?\n\u201cAnd Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n\u201cAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 16:13\u201317.)\nOn numerous occasions, he declared that he was the Christ, the Son of God.\nIs it any wonder then that he, the Son of God, the great Creator, had power over the elements of this earth, even to violate the law of gravity by walking on the water?\nI suppose it was quite simple for him, the Creator, when obligated to provide wine at the wedding feast to change the water to wine.\nNor was it a trick of the imagination when he fed five thousand plus the women and children with a few loaves and fishes, and on another occasion, four thousand plus the women and children. (See Matt. 14:16\u201321, Matt. 15:32\u201338.)\nHe also showed his power over the elements when at his command to \u201cbe still,\u201d the stormy sea was calmed. (Mark 4:39.)\nHe demonstrated his power over the animal kingdom; on two separate occasions, at his command, a great catch of fish was made when they had had no success before. (See Matt. 14:16\u201321, Matt. 15:32\u201338.)\nHe showed his power over the vegetable kingdom when he cursed the fig tree. (See Matt. 21:19.)\nOn each occasion, he was declared to be the Christ, the literal Son of God.\nHe healed all manner of illness or disease. At his command, the evil spirits departed, they, too, declaring who he was. He made the blind to see, the lame to walk. Yes, he even controlled life itself, for he restored Lazarus to life, who had been declared dead for four days. There were others, too.\nYes, \u201cthe earth is the Lord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof.\u201d (1 Cor. 10:26.) He had dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth\u2014in the earth, on the earth, and in the heaven above the earth.\nAll he did was for others\u2014his was a life of service. There was not one selfish act.\nApproaching the finish of his mission here, he prayed to the Father: \u201cI have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\n\u201cAnd now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.\u201d (John 17:4\u20135.)\nHe took upon himself the sins of all who shall repent, and gave his life that all might live. He brought about the resurrection for all. Do you realize that the creation of this earth, and all the work of Jesus and the prophets since the very beginning, was for you\u2014that you might have immortality and eternal life\u2014just as much as for anyone else?\nFinally, in preparation for the restoration of his kingdom on the earth, in these the last days, he said: \u201cTherefore I command you to repent\u2014repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore\u2014how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.\n\u201cFor behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;\n\u201cBut if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;\n\u201cWhich suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit\u2014and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink\u2014\n\u201cNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\n\u201cWherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power.\u201d (D&C 19:15\u201320; italics added.)\nDo you so think of him when partaking of the sacrament, and covenant to keep his commandments? To know him is to keep his commandments. Do you know him who was called Jesus?\nYes, this is he whom we worship. He is the Son of God; the Great Creator. He is our Savior and Redeemer. He is our advocate with the Father. It was he who made possible and brought about the universal resurrection. It was he, with his Father, who appeared to Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove.\nAnd after a marvelous revelation given to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, they testified, \u201cAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!\n\u201cFor we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father\u2014\n\u201cThat by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.\u201d (D&C 76:22\u201324.)\nI testify that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that it was under his direction that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in this dispensation for the last time. I so testify to these truths in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nEldred G. Smith\nWho Is Jesus?\n1976\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Unitedly we thank the Almighty for the wondrous prolongation of the life of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, enabling him to preach that powerful sermon. Our gratitude is profound!\nI pray for the Spirit of the Lord to help me communicate his mind and will on a very vital and sensitive subject. I apologize for the use of words repugnant to me and ill-suited to this hallowed pulpit. I do so only for clarity of communication regarding reverence for human life.\nAs sons and daughters of God, we cherish life as a gift from him.\nA heavy toll on life is included among the evils of war. Data from all nations are appalling. For the United States of America, one hundred thousand were killed in World War I; over four hundred thousand died in World War II. In the first two hundred years as a nation, the lives of over one million Americans were lost due to war.\nRegrettable as is the loss of loved ones from war, these figures are dwarfed by the toll of a new war that annually claims more casualties than the total number of fatalities from all the wars of this nation.\nIt is a war on the defenseless\u2014and the voiceless. It is a war on the unborn.\nThis war, labeled \u201cabortion,\u201d is of epidemic proportion and is waged globally. Over fifty-five million abortions were reported worldwide in the year 1974 alone.1 Sixty-four percent of the world\u2019s population now live in countries that legally sanction this practice.2 In the United States of America, over 1.5 million abortions are performed annually.3 About 25\u201330 percent of all pregnancies now end in abortion.4 In some metropolitan areas, there are more abortions performed than live births.5 Comparable data also come from other nations.\nYet society professes reverence for human life. We weep for those who die, pray and work for those whose lives are in jeopardy. For years I have labored with other doctors here and abroad, struggling to prolong life. It is impossible to describe the grief a physician feels when the life of a patient is lost. Can anyone imagine how we feel when life is destroyed at its roots, as though it were a thing of naught?\nWhat sense of inconsistency can allow people to grieve for their dead, yet be calloused to this baleful war being waged on life at the time of its silent development? What logic would encourage efforts to preserve the life of a critically ill twelve-week-old infant, but countenance the termination of another life twelve weeks after inception? More attention is seemingly focused on the fate of a life at some penitentiary\u2019s death row than on the millions totally deprived of life\u2019s opportunity through such odious carnage before birth.\nThe Lord has repeatedly declared this divine imperative: \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d6 Recently he added, \u201cNor do anything like unto it.\u201d (D&C 59:6.) Even before the fulness of the gospel was restored, the enlightened understood the sanctity of life. John Calvin, the sixteenth-century reformer, wrote: \u201cIf it seems more horrible to kill a man in his own house than in a field, because a man\u2019s house is his place of most secure refuge, it ought surely to be deemed more atrocious to destroy a fetus in the womb before it has come to light.\u201d7\nBut what impropriety could now legalize that which has been forbidden by the laws of God from the dawn of time? What twisted reasoning has transformed mythical concepts into contorted slogans assenting to a practice which is consummately wrong?\nThese slogans begin with proper concern for the health of the mother. Infrequently, instances may occur in which the continuation of pregnancy could be life-threatening to the mother. When deemed by competent medical authorities that the life of one must be terminated in order to save the life of the other, many agree that it is better to spare the mother. But these circumstances are rare, particularly where modern medical care is available.\nAnother sympathetic concern applies to pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The tragedy of this despoilment is compounded because, in such relationships, freedom of choice is denied the woman who is innocently involved.\nBut less than 3 percent of all abortions are performed for these two reasons.8 The other 97 percent are performed for what may be termed \u201creasons of convenience.\u201d\nSome argue for abortion because a malformed child may result. The harmful effects of certain infectious or toxic agents in the first trimester of pregnancy are real.\nThe experience of a couple whom I shall identify as Brother and Sister Brown (fictitious names) is instructive. Sister Brown was only twenty-one years old at the time, a beautiful woman and a devoted wife. In her first trimester, she contracted the dreaded German measles.\nAbortion was advised because the developing baby would almost surely be damaged. Some members of her family, out of loving concern, applied additional pressure for an abortion. \u201cDon\u2019t burden yourself financially with a handicapped child,\u201d they argued. \u201cYou are too young and too poor.\u201d\nDevotedly Brother and Sister Brown consulted their bishop. He referred them to their stake president, who listened to their serious concern and counseled them not to terminate the life of this baby, even though the child might have a problem. He quoted this scripture:\n\u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\u201d (Prov. 3:5\u20136.)\nThey chose to follow that counsel and permit their child to be born\u2014a beautiful little girl, normal in every respect, except for a hearing loss, that became evident later. After an evaluation at a school for the deaf, Brother and Sister Brown were advised that this child had the intellect of a genius. Now, some twenty years later, she attends a major university on a scholarship.\nWhen recently asked how they felt about their once-weighty decision, the mother quickly responded, \u201cShe is one of the great joys of my life! She is such a choice spirit! Though she lost the sense of hearing, she has compensated with augmented ability otherwise. Her eyes are alive with constant attention. She excels in dancing, even though she perceives the sounds of music from vibrations. She has served as an officer in school. But most significant is her guileless spirit, her unconditional love. She has taught us to serve and to share. Her spiritual insights have helped us to know God and his purposes. My husband and I are so grateful that she is one of our children.\u201d\nConsider another individual weighing the consequences of her pregnancy. She was beyond the normal age for bearing children. She announced to her doctor that her husband was an alcoholic with a syphilitic infection. One of her children had been born dead. Another child was blind. Another had tuberculosis. Her family had a history of deafness. Finally she confessed that she was living in abject poverty. If this true historical situation were posed today, many would recommend abortion. The child born from that pregnancy became the renowned composer Ludwig van Beethoven.\nBut the principle involved extends beyond those who may become great. If one is to be deprived of life because of potential for developing physical problems, consistency would dictate that those who already have such deficiencies should likewise be terminated. Continuing, then, those who are either infirm, incompetent, or inconvenient should be eliminated by those in power. Such irreverence for life is unthinkable!\nAnother contention raised is that a woman is free to choose what she does with her own body. To a certain extent this is true for all of us. We are free to think. We are free to plan. And then we are free to do. But once an action has been taken, we are never free from its consequences. Those considering abortion have already exercised certain choices.\nTo clarify this concept, we can learn from the astronaut. Any time during the selection process, planning, and preparation, he is free to withdraw. But once the powerful rocket fuel is ignited, he is no longer free to choose. Now he is bound by the consequences of his choice. Even if difficulties develop and he might wish otherwise, the choice made was sealed by action.\nSo it is with those who would tamper with the God-given power of procreation. They are free to think and plan otherwise, but their choice is sealed by action.\nThe woman\u2019s choice for her own body does not validate choice for the body of another. The expression \u201cterminate the pregnancy\u201d applies literally only to the woman. The consequence of terminating the fetus therein involves the body and very life of another. These two individuals have separate brains, separate hearts, and separate circulatory systems. To pretend that there is no child and no life there is to deny reality.\nIt is not a question of when \u201cmeaningful life\u201d begins or when the spirit \u201cquickens\u201d the body. In the biological sciences, it is known that life begins when two germ cells unite to become one cell, bringing together twenty-three chromosomes from both the father and from the mother. These chromosomes contain thousands of genes. In a marvelous process involving a combination of genetic coding by which all the basic human characteristics of the unborn person are established, a new DNA complex is formed. A continuum of growth results in a new human being. The onset of life is not a debatable issue, but a fact of science.\nApproximately twenty-two days after the two cells have united, a little heart begins to beat. At twenty-six days the circulation of blood begins.9\nScripture declares that the \u201clife of the flesh is in the blood.\u201d (Lev. 17:11.) Abortion sheds that innocent blood.\nAnother excuse some use to justify abortion relates to population control. Many in developing nations unknowingly ascribe their lack of prosperity to overpopulation. While they grovel in ignorance of God and his commandments, they may worship objects of their own creation (or nothing at all), while unsuccessfully attempting to limit their population by the rampant practice of abortion. They live in squalor, oblivious to the divine teaching\u2014stated in the scriptures not once, but thirty-four times\u2014that people will prosper in the land only if they obey the commandments of God.10\nHow can God fulfill his promise to prosper his children in obedience if they worship idols or destroy life created by him\u2014destined to be in his very image?\nThey will prosper only when their education includes faith in and obedience to the God of this world, who said,\n\u201cI, the Lord, \u2026 built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine. And it is my purpose to provide. \u2026 But it must needs be done in mine own way. \u2026 For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare.\u201d (D&C 104:14\u201317; italics added.)\nNow, as a servant of the Lord, I dutifully warn those who advocate and practice abortion that they incur the wrath of Almighty God, who declared, \u201cIf men \u2026 hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, \u2026 he shall be surely punished.\u201d (Ex. 21:22.)\nOf those who shed innocent blood, a prophet declared: \u201cThe judgments which [God] shall exercise \u2026 in his wrath [shall] be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.\u201d (Alma 14:11.)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has consistently opposed the practice of abortion. One hundred years ago the First Presidency wrote: \u201cAnd we again take this opportunity of warning the Latter-day Saints against those \u2026 practices of foeticide and infanticide.\u201d11\nEarly in his presidency, our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball said, \u201cWe decry abortions and ask our people to refrain from this serious transgression.\u201d12\nWhy destroy a life that could bring such joy to others?\nNow, is there hope for those who have so sinned without full understanding, who now suffer heartbreak? Yes. So far as is known, the Lord does not regard this transgression as murder. And \u201cas far as has been revealed, a person may repent and be forgiven for the sin of abortion.\u201d13 Gratefully, we know the Lord will help all who are truly repentant.\nYes, life is precious! No one can cuddle a cherished newborn baby, look into those beautiful eyes, feel the little fingers, and caress that miraculous creation without deepening reverence for life and for our Creator.\nLife comes from life. It is a gift from our Heavenly Father. It is eternal, as he is eternal. Innocent life is not sent by him to be destroyed! This doctrine is not of me, but is that of the living God and of his divine Son, which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRussell M. Nelson\nReverence for Life\n1985\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "On a beautiful sunny morning, I invited my almost eight-year-old granddaughter, Vicki, to walk with me near a lake, which is actually a water reservoir for our beautiful city.\nWe walked happily, listening to the soft noise of the crystal clear brook running alongside our path. The path was lined with beautiful green trees and sweet-scented flowers. We could hear birds singing.\nI asked my blue-eyed, cheerful, and innocent granddaughter how she was preparing for baptism.\nShe answered with a question: \u201cGrandpa, what is sin?\u201d\nI silently prayed for inspiration and tried to respond as simply as I could: \u201cSin is the intentional disobedience to God\u2019s commandments. It makes Heavenly Father sad, and its results are suffering and sadness.\u201d\nClearly concerned, she asked me, \u201cAnd how does it get us?\u201d\nThe question first reveals purity, but it also reveals a concern for how to avoid involvement with sin.\nFor her to understand more clearly, I used the natural elements we had around us as an illustration. Continuing down our path, we found by the side of a barbed-wire fence a stone post of considerable size; it was a heavy structure with flowers, bushes, and little trees growing around it. Over time these plants would become bigger than the post itself.\nI remembered that a little farther down the path, we would find another post that had already been taken over little by little, almost unnoticed, by the vegetation that grew around it. I imagine that a post would not perceive that, despite its strength, it could be encompassed and destroyed by fragile plants. The post would have thought, \u201cNo problem. I am strong and big, and this small plant will do me no harm.\u201d\nSo as a nearby tree grows bigger, the post does not notice at first; then the post starts enjoying the shade the tree provides. But the tree continues to grow, and it encircles the post with two branches that at first seem fragile but that in time intertwine and surround the post.\nStill the post does not realize what is happening.\nSoon, in our walk, we found the proverbial post. It had been plucked out from the ground. My little granddaughter looked impressed and asked me, \u201cGrandpa, is this the tree of sin?\u201d\nI then explained to her that it was only a symbol, or an example, of how sin gets us.\nI don\u2019t know what the effect of our conversation will be on her, but it made me think of the many faces of sin and of how it sneaks into our lives if we allow it to.\nWe must be alert because small choices can bring great consequences, just as going to bed early and waking up early have great consequences. Doctrine and Covenants 88:124 teaches us, \u201cArise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.\u201d Those who go to bed early wake up rested, with the body and mind invigorated and blessed by the Lord because of obedience.\nWhat may appear to be of little importance, such as going to bed late, not praying for a day, skipping fasting, or breaking the Sabbath\u2014such little slips\u2014will make us lose sensitivity little by little, allowing us to do worse things.\nWhen I was a teenager, my curfew was 10:00 p.m. Today, that is the time some go out in order to have fun. Yet we know that it is at night that some of the worst things happen. It is during the dark hours that some youth go to places with inappropriate environments, where music and lyrics do not allow them to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Then, under these circumstances, they become easy prey to sin.\nOften, becoming prey to sin starts with someone choosing friends whose standards are not consistent with the gospel; and in order to be popular or to be accepted by peers, the person then compromises gospel principles and laws, going down a path that will bring only pain and sadness to this person and to his or her loved ones.\nWe must be alert not to let sin grow around us. Forms of sin are everywhere\u2014even, for example, in a computer or cell phone. These technologies are useful and can bring great benefits to us. But their inappropriate use\u2014such as involvement in time-wasting games, programs that would drive you to carnal pleasure, or much worse things such as pornography\u2014is destructive. Pornography destroys character and makes its user sink in the quicksand of filth, out of which the person can escape only with much help.\nThis terrible monster causes pain and suffering both to the user and to his or her innocent children, spouse, father, and mother. The fruit of carnal pleasure is bitterness and sadness. The fruit of obedience and sacrifice is sweetness and everlasting joy.\nDecisions about standards to follow must be made in advance, not when temptation appears. Our parameters must be:\nThis I will do because it is right, it comes from the Lord, and it will bring me happiness.\nThis I will not do because it will drag me away from truth, from the Lord, and from the eternal happiness He promises to the faithful and obedient.\nSince the Father knew we would make wrong choices, He, in His wonderful plan of love, provided a Savior of the world to atone for the sins of all those who repent; who come to Him looking for help, consolation, and forgiveness; and who are willing to take upon them His name, Jesus Christ.\nIf we sin, we must look for help quickly because alone we cannot escape sin\u2019s trap, just as the proverbial fence post cannot free itself. Someone must help us get rid of the deadly embrace.\nParents can help, and the bishop is called by God to help us. It is to him that we must go and open our hearts.\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:42\u201343 explains:\n\u201cBehold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.\n\u201cBy this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins\u2014behold, he will confess them and forsake them.\u201d\nA few months after our walk near the lake, my granddaughter was interviewed by her bishop\u2014her father\u2014for baptism. After the interview I asked her how it went. She answered, almost rebuking me, \u201cGrandpa, an interview is confidential. You know that.\u201d\nBishops, I hope you take that response seriously. It seems to me that my granddaughter grew a lot in understanding in a very short time.\nJust as the tree I have described brought sadness, pain, suffering, and entrapment, another tree can bring the opposite. It is mentioned in 1 Nephi 8:10\u201312:\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.\n\u201cAnd as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy.\u201d\nDear brethren and sisters, stay strong and make good choices that will allow you to eat the fruit of the tree of life. If, for any reason, you have erred or left the path, our hand is extended and we say to you, \u201cCome. There is hope. We love you, and we want to help you be happy.\u201d\nHeavenly Father loves us so much that He has given His only Son, Jesus Christ.\nJesus Christ loves us so much that He gave His life in atonement for our sins!\nWhat are we willing to give to be clean and receive that joy?\nOf these truths I bear my testimony in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJairo Mazzagardi\nAvoiding the Trap of Sin\n2010\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My brothers and sisters, I am blessed to stand at this pulpit and feel the radiating spirit of those who have gone before over the past 108 years since the first conference was held in this building, and to feel the testimonies which have been borne this day. There is no better man to follow and be next to than Adney Y. Komatsu. He is a man of God, simple and humble, with whom I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life in the service of the Lord. There is a great spirit that comes from the choir. These things make it possible for me to discuss a subject which is close to my heart.\nSpend a few thoughtful moments with me, if you would, discussing the phrase \u201cWe can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d Many of us have varying degrees of testimonies. We have all been given the Spirit of Christ at birth. It was a gift. We all have a testimony which we have developed ourselves throughout our lives which the Holy Ghost has helped us to obtain. We may know that God lives. We may know that Jesus is the Christ. We may know that he gave his life for our redemption, that he is resurrected that we might live, and that he is alive today. We may know that Joseph Smith has restored The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the last dispensation of the fulness of times. Yes, we live in that choice period of time which is the \u201clast dispensation\u201d before the second coming of Jesus Christ. We live in the \u201cfulness of times\u201d\u2014a time when the scriptures that have been revealed to us are virtually all the scriptures available to mankind. We may know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God who has all the keys of the priesthood vested in him to lead this church by revelation in these latter days. Yet, my brothers and sisters, with all of this knowledge, why is it that some of us fail to learn the very critical point that we did not come to this life to live it alone?\nYou can\u2019t hide your actions from self and others. Polonius\u2019 advice to his son, Laertes:\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nis valid, but must be qualified and expanded to include the concern for how to be true to yourself and your fellowman. The \u201cisolated self\u201d shut off from the Light of Christ makes us become fallible\u2014open to delusion. The balance and perspective which come from caring about others and allowing others to care for us form the essence of life itself. We need the inspired help of others to avoid deceiving ourselves. It has always been a mystery to me why the intellectual elite sometimes shut themselves off from the Spirit of God.\nI am here to bear my testimony that we were with our Heavenly Father before we came to this life. The scriptures tell us so. We also know that we chose to take a physical body, to come to live in this estate, to live His commandments, and to have opposition in all things. The opposition which we must have is to make us strong; the fire which we withstand is to harden our spiritual steel.\nIt is also God\u2019s plan that we cannot return to his presence alone, without the help of someone else. James put it best: \u201cFaith without works is dead, being alone.\u201d (James 2:17.) The gospel plan requires giving and receiving. Faith alone is not enough. We need \u201cworks\u201d to serve and to be served. We can\u2019t do it alone.\nThe many missions which we have in life cannot be embarked upon successfully without the help of others. Birth requires earthly parents. Our blessing as a child, our baptism, our receiving the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, our receiving membership in his church, ordination to the priesthood, going on a mission, being married, having children of our own, blessings during illness and times of need\u2014all require the help of others. And all these are acts of love and service which require the help of others and the giving of help to others.\nWhen we return to our Heavenly Father, he does not want us to come back alone. He wants us to return with honor with our families and those whom we have helped along the road of life. In preparing this message, it has become very clear to me that the true nature of the gospel plan is the interdependence we have upon one another in this life and the estate in which we now live.\nIt is clear to me that we have imperfections of body, imperfections of mind and intellect\u2014that we are not perfect. And for that reason we are dependent on others. We must be self-sufficient ourselves, but that does not mean independent of help of others. We cannot gain a testimony without having the help of the Holy Ghost. We cannot do genealogy without having the help of those who came before us\u2014our forebears. We are here to see if we will serve the \u201cleast of these our brothers,\u201d and since I\u2019ve been a General Authority I have come to find out that the President of the Church, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles consider themselves the least of us.\nA just God has placed us here on the planet earth where we experience suffering and imperfection all around us. And this life and estate are necessary because in this life we experience something we cannot do any other place. The life we had before and the life we will have hereafter will leave our bodies, spirits, and minds in a more perfect state. But we did not and will not have the opportunities to give of ourselves in the same way as we can in this life. What a simple truth of a gospel principle! As we suffer and serve in this life, we are fulfilling a very essential part of the gospel plan.\nWhen I was a lieutenant in the air force, our squadron selected as its motto \u201cReturn with Honor.\u201d We realized that this motto applied to all members of the flight. It did not just apply to us as individuals. We flew jet fighter planes in a fingertip formation. For a moment, fold your thumb under your hand and look at the back of your hand with your fingers extended. You will see a flight of four planes with a leader and three wingmen. You are protected on the left and on the right, and the leader is concentrating on his goals. If for a moment you will separate and put two fingers on either side, you will still see a leader and a wingman, one plane ahead of the other, and one plane on the wing to protect. We all knew and were taught from bitter experience that a \u201cloner\u201d out of formation was unprotected and would surely be destroyed.\nWhy then do many of us \u201cgo it alone\u201d and deny those who love us most the joy and blessings which come from sharing? The principle of helping one in need is well expressed in the touching love story of Thomas Moore, a famous nineteenth century Irish poet, who, when he returned from a business trip found his wife had locked herself in her upstairs bedroom and had asked to see no one. Moore learned the terrible truth that his beautiful wife had contracted smallpox and her milky complexion was now pocked and scarred. She had looked at herself in the mirror and demanded that the shutters be drawn, and that she never see her husband again. Thomas Moore did not listen. He went upstairs to the darkened room and started to light the lamp. His wife pleaded with him to let her remain in darkness alone. She felt it best not to subject her husband to seeing his loved one with her beauty marred. She asked him to go.\nMoore did go. He went downstairs and spent the rest of the night in prayerful writing. He had never written a song before, but that night he wrote not only words but also composed music. As daylight broke, Moore returned to his wife\u2019s darkened room. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you must not see me. Please don\u2019t press me, Thomas.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll sing to you then,\u201d he said. Thomas Moore sang to his wife the song that still lives today.\nBelieve me, if all those endearing young charms\nWhich I gaze on so fondly today,\nWere to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms,\nLike fairy gifts fading away,\nThou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art\nMoore heard a movement in the corner of the darkened room where his wife lay in loneliness. He continued:\nLet thy loveliness fade as it will,\nAnd around the dear ruin each wish of my heart\nWould entwine itself verdantly still.\nThe song ended. As his voice faded, Moore heard his bride arise. She crossed the room to the window, reached up and slowly withdrew the shutters, opened the curtain, and let in the morning light.\nI would like at this time to thank my wife for opening up the shutters and letting in her light and her life and sharing it with me. I would not be here today without her love and companionship.\nWhen we are marred spiritually or physically, our first reaction is to withdraw into the dark shadows of depression, to blot out hope and joy\u2014the light of life which comes from knowing we are living the commandments of our Father in heaven. This withdrawal will ultimately lead us to rebellion against those who would like to be our friends, those who can help us most, even our family. But worst of all, we finally reject ourselves.\nThose who are alone and lonely should not retreat to the sanctuary of their private thoughts and chambers. Such retreat will ultimately lead them into the darkening influence of the adversary, which leads to despondency, loneliness, frustration, and to thinking of themselves as worthless. After one thinks of himself as worthless, he then ofttimes turns to associates who corrode those delicate spiritual contacts, rendering their spiritual receiving antennas and transmitters useless. What good is it to associate with and ask advice of someone who is disoriented himself and only tells us what we want to hear? Isn\u2019t it better to turn to loving parents and friends who can help us reach for and attain celestial goals?\nAlma summarized the essence of a loving father talking to his sons and \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d when he said to Helaman and Shiblon: \u201cInasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cast off from his presence.\u201d (Alma 38:1; see also Alma 36:30.) That is difficult for a father to say to his son, but it is the truth.\nWhen you attempt to live life\u2019s experiences alone, you are not being true to yourself, nor to your basic mission in life. Individuals in difficulty often say: \u201cI\u2019ll do it alone,\u201d \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need you,\u201d \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d It has been said that no one is so rich that he does not need another\u2019s help, no one so poor as not to be useful in some way to his fellowman. The disposition to ask assistance from others with confidence, and to grant it with kindness, should be part of our very nature.\nWhen I was a young boy in Long Island, New York, a robin built her nest every year on the roof of our home. We used to watch as she had her little ones. She fed them and nurtured them. And when it was time for them to fly, she gently and lovingly would nudge them out of the nest. They would glide to the ground, their wings fluttering\u2014unsure, afraid, and not knowing how to fly. Then the mother would go down to the ground and help them learn how to find their food and teach them how to fly. She wanted to help them to be on their own.\nIt brought me great sorrow each year when I would find a young bird that tried to \u201cdo it alone.\u201d Often he would be found dead in the rock garden below among the lilies of the valley.\nA hermit is one who suffers from the extreme of selfishness; he neutralizes all the gifts and talents which he has been given in this life to help others, for he is going the adversary\u2019s cunning way. Loneliness and withdrawal take us as a pawn off the board in the game of life.\nWhittier best described life and our dependence on each other when he wrote:\nThee lift me, and I\u2019ll lift thee\nAnd we\u2019ll both ascend together.\nYes, we started with our Heavenly Father. We came to this life. We take whatever the adversary gives us, and then ideally we return to our Heavenly Father \u201cwith honor.\u201d\nI have a very simple testimony. I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that we came to this life with a purpose and that the greatest joy we will receive will be those acts of love and service that we do for others. Through this love and service we ourselves grow in strength and testimony and have the blessings of our Heavenly Father poured out upon ourselves and our families. I have also found in life that there is none too great to need the help of others. There is none so great that he can \u201cdo it alone.\u201d\nIf only we could live our lives as our prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, does\u2014in the guileless, loving way in which he shows concern for, gives to, and serves all those around him\u2014we would truly understand that we need the help of others and that they need our help. That we might understand this basic principle of the gospel, having love for and allowing ourselves to be loved by our fellowmen, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nRobert D. Hales\nWe Can\u2019t Do It Alone\n1975\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Sister Cook and I were called to Mongolia as missionaries roughly one year before it was formally organized as a mission. We look back on that time as one of the most memorable, satisfying, and blessed periods of our lives. That time is still rewarding us with rich experiences and blessings.\nThe Lord has said to missionaries, \u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\u201d (D&C 18:15).\nThis promise stands like a beacon to every missionary, but as if that weren\u2019t enough, there are other blessings from missionary work, and they are many and varied. Some are immediate; others come only with time.\nWe experienced one of those \u201conly with time\u201d blessings this past February when we attended the naming and blessing of a little Mongolian girl in our expanded missionary family. Her name is Tungalag. Her mother is Davaajargal. She\u2019s a modern-day pioneer as the first woman to be baptized in Mongolia. Tungalag\u2019s father, Sanchir, is an MBA student at BYU.\nI knew Sanchir in Mongolia for some time before he became a member. It was only after one year and many, many discussions with dedicated missionaries that he was baptized. It is nothing short of a miracle that this young father, after only two years in the Church, could have uttered the words of this beautiful blessing which began, \u201cTungalag, I bless you that you will be a good human being.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget that beginning!\nIn this blessing he said things that he would not have known or even imagined before his baptism. Witnessing this blessing and realizing the extent to which the gospel has changed this young man and this family truly made this a missionary payday.\nPresident Hinckley has said: \u201cThe most satisfying experience I have is to see what this gospel does for people. It gives them a new outlook on life. It gives them a perspective that they have never felt before. It raises their sights to things noble and divine. Something happens to them that is miraculous to behold. They look to Christ and come alive\u201d (\u201cConverts and Young Men,\u201d Ensign, May 1997, 48).\nMy experience has been that when our converts \u201ccome alive\u201d\u2014and they need nourishment\u2014in the gospel, they soon come alive as students, as parents, in their professions, and as citizens. Their lives and the lives of their posterity are changed forever.\nShortly after Sister Cook and I arrived in Mongolia, we were asked to accompany two young elders to a city called Muren. At the conclusion of our trip, our return was delayed by bad weather. Each day we went to the airport to see if our plane was going to arrive so we could fly out. We waited with other passengers until we received word whether we would depart that day or would be forced to return to the city for the evening.\nTrying to take the same flight out was a group of foreign tourists. They told us they had been by horseback to some of the most remote, little-explored areas of Mongolia.\nWhile we were waiting at the airport, one of these tourists approached one of our elders and said: \u201cI know who you are! What are you doing here? These people don\u2019t need you. They are an unspoiled people with a rich heritage. Why don\u2019t you just go home and leave them alone?\u201d\nThe elder came to me and was very upset, and we talked about the several responses he could have given. It wasn\u2019t until about two weeks later, however, that I read a statement by President Benson that explained what would have been the perfect response. President Benson said:\n\u201cSome may ask why we as a people and church quietly and consistently seek to change individuals while there are such large problems about us. \u2026 But decaying cities are simply a delayed reflection of decaying individuals. \u2026 The commandments of God give emphasis to improvement of the individual as the only real way to bring about the real improvement of society\u201d (A Plea for America [1975], 18).\n\u201cThe Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of the people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. \u2026 Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature\u201d (\u201cBorn of God,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1985, 6).\nPresident Kimball once called missionary work the lifeblood of the Church, and indeed it is. It\u2019s not only because new converts give the Church vitality and strength, but the missionaries themselves gain a new measure of vitality and strength as they participate in the converts\u2019 commitment to Christ. This vitality and strength is a mighty force, an instrument in God\u2019s hands to cause the gospel to roll forth and fill the whole earth as Daniel saw in his dream (see D&C 65:2).\nWhile we have our free agency, missionary work, in its various forms, is not an optional program. We talk about the blessings of missionary work, but in reality we should do missionary work because it\u2019s our duty. The scriptures and every prophet since Joseph Smith have reminded us it\u2019s our duty to go unto all nations to warn our neighbors.\nWilford Woodruff put it clearly when he said: \u201cThere never was a set of men since God made the world under a stronger responsibility to warn this generation, to lift up our voices long and loud, day and night as far as we have the opportunity and declare the words of God unto this generation. We are required to do this. This is our calling. [This] is our duty. [This] is our business\u201d (Deseret News Semi-Weekly, 6 July 1880, 1).\nI pray we\u2019ll make missionary work our business and not let other less important business get in the way. We receive blessings from keeping all of God\u2019s commandments. There are, however, few blessings like missionary blessings! How sweet is the work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard E. Cook\nChrist Can Change Human Behavior\n1998\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I propose some simple tests that all of us may take to determine if we are true to the faith. They consist of a few basic questions, all of which must be answered correctly in order to gain the full blessings of the gospel in this life and inherit eternal life in the realms ahead.\nOur well-beloved brother Paul, an Apostle of old, counsels us in these words: \u201cExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.\u201d (2 Cor. 13:5.)\nAnd we may well ask ourselves: Do we believe all of the doctrines of salvation? Are we keeping the commandments? Are we valiant in the cause of truth and righteousness? Will we be saved in the kingdom of God?\nFrom among many questions that all of us must one day answer, let me test you on these:\nTest one: Do I worship the only true and living God?\nThere is no salvation in worshiping a false god\u2014neither a cow; nor a crocodile; nor a cedar post; nor even a spirit essence, without body, parts, or passions, that fills the immensity of space.\nTrue believers worship that Holy Being who \u201cmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\u201d (Rev. 14:7.)\nHe is the Father of spirits with whom we dwelt before the foundations of the earth were laid. He is our Father in Heaven, who ordained and established a plan of salvation by which his spirit children might advance and progress and become like him.\nHe is a Holy Man, a personage of tabernacle, having a body of flesh and bones; and he created mortal man in his own image, \u201cmale and female created he them.\u201d (Gen. 1:27.)\nHe is a glorified and exalted being in whom all fulness and perfection dwell, who knows all things and has all power, all might, and all dominion.\nTest two: Do I believe in the fall of Adam?\nThere is no salvation in a system of religion that rejects the doctrine of the Fall or that assumes man is the end product of evolution and so was not subject to a fall.\nTrue believers know that this earth and man and all forms of life were created in an Edenic, or paradisiacal, state in which there was no mortality, no procreation, no death.\nIn that primeval day Adam and Eve were \u201cin a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.\u201d (2 Ne. 2:23.)\nBut in the providences of the Lord, \u201cAdam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\u201d (2 Ne. 2:25.)\nBy his fall, Adam introduced temporal and spiritual death into the world and caused this earth life to become a probationary estate.\nTest three: Do I believe in the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ?\nAs to this question, I give my own personal answer. It is:\nI know that my Redeemer lives; with Job I testify. \u201cWhat though the ravages of disease destroy my body; what though I am slain by the sword of death\u2014yet I know that he who bought me with his blood shall soon reign on earth and that \u201cin my flesh shall I see God.\u201d (Job 19:26; see also Job 19:25.)\nI am a witness that he was lifted up upon the cross of Calvary; that he was crucified, died, and rose again the third day; that he ascended into heaven, where, sitting on the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, he now reigns in everlasting glory; and that he will soon come again among the sons of men.\nI know that he is the one Mediator between God and man; that he brings to pass the immortality and eternal life of man; that his is a ministry of reconciliation whereby fallen man can be reconciled with his Maker.\nI know that salvation is in Christ and that only by faith in his name can we hope for the riches of eternity.\nHe is my Brother and Friend, but he is more. He is my Lord, my God, and my King, whom I worship in the full majesty of his Godhead and who will continue to be my Savior, my Redeemer, and my God through all the eternities that lie ahead.\nTest four: Do I accept the true plan of salvation?\nAs there is only one God and one Savior, so there is only one salvation, one strait and narrow path leading to eternal life, one way in which the grace of God can be poured out upon us mortals in full measure.\nTo gain salvation all men everywhere must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. They must repent of their sins and be baptized by a legal administrator who has power to seal on earth and in heaven. They must receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, be sanctified by the power of the Spirit, and keep the commandments of God all their days.\nTest five: Do I believe the gospel as it has been restored in this final dispensation of grace?\nBe it known to all men, let it be proclaimed by the very trump of God, let angelic choirs sing of its wonders and glory, let all the hosts of men stand in awe as the voice from heaven declares that God has in these last days restored the fulness of his everlasting gospel.\nLet every eye see, every ear hear, every heart be penetrated\u2014for the voice of God is heard again. Angels again are coming from the courts of glory to declare eternal truths to mortal men. The gift of the Holy Ghost is being poured out upon the faithful, and thousands again shout praises to the Holy One of Israel.\nHear it, all ye ends of the earth. God has spoken; the heavens have been opened; we have his gospel; keys and powers are again vested in men; and all men are invited to come, without money and without price, and feast upon the good word of God, for salvation is free.\nTest six: Am I a faithful member of the true Church?\nAm I keeping the commandments of God? Do I love and serve him with all my heart, might, mind, and strength?\nThere is no such thing as gaining salvation from a false god, or by conforming to a false plan of salvation, or through membership in a false church.\nTruth\u2014pure, diamond truth\u2014truth unmixed with error, truth and truth alone can lead a soul to salvation.\nTest seven: Do I honor Joseph Smith as the great prophet of the Restoration?\nIn the days of Jesus, wicked and evil men separated themselves from the true Christians by defaming the name of Jesus and cursing him as a false prophet.\nIn our day the same approach is made by ill-disposed persons to the name of Joseph Smith. The way men feel about him and his prophetic successors divides true believers from those who serve another master.\nUnto Joseph Smith, seer of latter days, the Lord of heaven spoke these words: \u201cThe ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;\n\u201cWhile the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.\u201d (D&C 122:1\u20132.)\nWhy will it ever be thus? Because Joseph Smith is the restorer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation; because he translated the Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of the gospel; because he received revelations as numerous and glorious as those given to Moses and Isaiah; because angelic ministrants gave him keys and powers and priesthoods, which enabled him and his successors to bind on earth and have their acts sealed everlastingly in the heavens\u2014all these are but a few of the reasons why we honor the name of Joseph Smith.\nI, for one, want to seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from the hands of such a man!\nTest eight: Am I enduring to the end, growing in grace, and gaining the attributes of godliness?\nThat is to say: Am I growing in faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity\u2014as Peter exhorted? (See 2 Pet. 1:5\u20137.)\nAm I working out my salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord\u2014as Paul counseled? (See Philip. 2:12.)\nAm I walking in the light, as God is in the light, enjoying fellowship with the Saints, so that \u201cthe blood of Jesus Christ his Son\u201d will cleanse me from all sin\u2014as John promised? (1 Jn. 1:7.)\nAm I pressing forward \u201cwith a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men, \u2026 feasting upon the word of Christ\u201d and enduring to the end\u2014as Nephi taught? (2 Ne. 31:20.)\nDo I have a special and holy love for the Saints, thus identifying me as a true disciple\u2014according to the word of the Lord Jesus? (See John 13:35.)\nTest nine: Do I put first in my life the things of God\u2019s kingdom? Is it with me and mine the kingdom of God or nothing?\nPresident Brigham Young\u2014of blessed memory who now reigns in heavenly courts\u2014devised this rallying cry: \u201cThe Kingdom of God or nothing.\u201d (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941, p. 444; see also Journal of Discourses, 11:249.)\nIt was echoed by his associates and might well be revived among us.\nA wise cleric of a former day leaves us this counsel: \u201cIf you have not chosen the kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead.\u201d\nThe kingdom of God on earth is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which prepares men for an inheritance in the kingdom of God in heaven, which is the celestial kingdom.\nWhen we put first in our lives the things of God\u2019s kingdom, we are speaking of the earthly kingdom which prepares us for the heavenly kingdom.\nWith us, in this life and in the life to come, it is and should be the kingdom of God or nothing.\nThis kingdom of God, both in time and in eternity, is governed by the spirit of inspiration. It always sends forth the mind and will of the Lord, whether by his own voice or by the voice of his servants it is the same. (See D&C 1:38.)\nOn every issue it behooves us to determine what the Lord would have us do and what counsel he has given through the appointed officers of his kingdom on earth.\nNo true Latter-day Saint will ever take a stand that is in opposition to what the Lord has revealed to those who direct the affairs of his earthly kingdom.\nNo Latter-day Saint who is true and faithful in all things will ever pursue a course, or espouse a cause, or publish an article or book that weakens or destroys faith.\nThere is, in fact, no such thing as neutrality where the gospel is concerned.\nJesus said: \u201cHe that is not with me is against me; and he that gathered not with me scattereth abroad.\u201d (Matt. 12:30.)\nAnd it was Jacob who said: \u201cThey who are not for me are against me, saith our God.\u201d (2 Ne. 10:16.)\nIf we do not sustain and uphold and support the kingdom of God in all things, we are thereby aiding a cause other than the Lord\u2019s.\nOnly the valiant are saved. Members of the Church who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus, not valiant in the cause of Christ, not valiant in defense of his prophets and in preaching his word are not heirs of the celestial kingdom.\nTest ten: Am I so living that I will be saved in the kingdom of God?\nThis is our goal and aim and purpose in life. Everything we do should please the Lord and further our strivings for salvation.\nAnd, the Lord be praised, there comes a time in the lives of faithful Saints when, having kept the faith and been true and faithful at all hazards, the Lord says to them: Thou shalt be exalted.\nThese, then, are a few of the many tests of true discipleship.\nNow, I have what every true disciple has. It is called the testimony of Jesus. In our day it includes the revealed knowledge that the earthly kingdom\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014will triumph. In this connection may I set before you this illustration:\nThe Church is like a great caravan\u2014organized, prepared, following an appointed course, with its captains of tens and captains of hundreds all in place.\nWhat does it matter if a few barking dogs snap at the heels of the weary travelers? Or that predators claim those few who fall by the way? The caravan moves on.\nIs there a ravine to cross, a miry mud hole to pull through, a steep grade to climb? So be it. The oxen are strong and the teamsters wise. The caravan moves on.\nAre there storms that rage along the way, floods that wash away the bridges, deserts to cross, and rivers to ford? Such is life in this fallen sphere. The caravan moves on.\nAhead is the celestial city, the eternal Zion of our God, where all who maintain their position in the caravan shall find food and drink and rest. Thank God that the caravan moves on!\nIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\nBruce\u00a0R.

Paul Reeve\nThe Oxford Handbook of Mormonism\nEdited by Terryl L. Givens and Philip L.

The\ntension between Mormons and the nation beginning after the Mormon exodus to the Great Basin in 1846 to Utah statehood in\n1896 shaped the Utah church and marked its flight from the United States and its subsequent uneven reintegration into American\nlife. The Mormon withdrawal transitioned over time from a geographic, economic, social, religious, and political withdrawal to\na primarily spiritual withdrawal, with temples as the central symbols of their sacred space. This chapter examines the necessity\nof molding diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds into a society with common aspirations and goals and how Mormonism\nshaped the immigrant populations and those populations shaped Mormonism.\nKeywords: temples, Exodus, Great Basin, Americanization, statehood\nT HE Mormon abandonment of Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1846, comprised a mass migration of an entire people. Roughly 12,000\nreligious refugees deliberately, and with considerable pathos, walked away from brick homes, log cabins, fences, barns,\noutbuildings, and community structures. It was an exodus of biblical proportions which stretched across an eight-month period\nculminating in the violent expulsion of the remaining poor Saints by September of that year. Some were leaving their second or\nthird home since joining this upstart and unpopular religion. But even more than hard-won homes, it was leaving their temple\nthat most fully embodied a collective sense of sacrifice and sorrow.\nIt was the most substantial religious edifice the Mormons had constructed to date, a stately structure with a limestone exterior\nperched on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and the town of Nauvoo. When the Mormons arrived at the site of their\nfuture city in 1839 they did so as refugees, fleeing a violent expulsion from Missouri and a state-sanctioned extermination order.\nAt Nauvoo they rebuilt their homes, their lives, and their faith. Their leader Joseph Smith introduced new ideas about the\ncorporeal nature of God, humankind\u2019s potential to be like Him, new temple rituals patterned after Masonic rites, and most\ncontroversially he introduced polygamy to a select inner circle of followers, a new doctrine that would ultimately lead to his\nmartyrdom in June 1844. In the background to these events, but central to the Saints\u2019 expanding cosmology, the temple reached\nslowly heavenward, a product of sweat, sacrifice, financial donations, and communal labor.\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 1 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nAlthough Smith did not live to see it completed, for the Saints he left behind, the temple stood as a solid and imposing witness\nof their devotion to their God and even more deeply, it represented their longings to be in His presence. Above the temple\u2019s\nsingle tower rose a weather vane which featured a horizontal angel sounding a trump. It was an artistic rendering that for some\nMormons symbolized Moroni, the same angel whom Joseph Smith claimed led him to buried gold plates from which he\ntranslated the Book of Mormon. In a vigorous east wind, the angel\u2019s trump would have pointed the way west (p. 39) for the\nbeleaguered Saints, across the Louisiana Purchase territory, still mostly Native American controlled, and from there outside the\npolitical boundaries of the United States, into Northern Mexico.\nMore than sounding a message of gospel outreach in 1846, the angel\u2019s trump signaled the call for retreat and a search for refuge.\nIt was a decided Mormon withdrawal from the outside world and a flight from secular time. As the Mormons trekked west\nacross Native American territory and breached an international boundary, they simultaneously inserted themselves into the\nbiblical narrative. They became ancient Israelites, born anew as sons and daughters of Abraham, heirs to a literal lineage upon\ncovenanting to follow Jesus. Their removal was both geographic and spiritual, withdrawing into the isolation of the Great Basin\nand also into sacred time and space.\nSoon after arriving in the Great Basin, the Mormons made plans to build a new temple at the heart of their desert Zion, a\nstructure so grand that it took forty years to complete. The Salt Lake Temple and the surrounding Temple Square quickly\nbecame the spiritual, emotional, and geographic center of Mormonism and the iconic symbol of their religious kingdom in\nretreat. When the temple was completed in 1893, a standing angel Moroni faced east atop its highest spire, in symbolic welcome\nto the returning Jesus whom the premillennial Mormons anticipate will come from the east at His second advent and usher in a\nthousand years of peace. Yet Moroni also looked east that year in a hopeful gaze back toward the United States, the nation that\nthe Mormons had fled only forty-seven years earlier. It was a dramatically different geopolitical view than the Saints\nencountered on their trek to the Great Basin. The railroad and telegraph now permanently connected them to the outside world\nand new states and territories had been carved out of the Louisiana Purchase and Mexican cession to crowd the Mormons and\neven whittle away at Utah\u2019s borders. With strict geographic isolation no longer possible and federal pressure nearly crushing in\nits weight, Moroni\u2019s trump this time sent a conciliatory signal of a newfound Mormon willingness to reenter secular time and\nspace, and to abandon the two elements of Mormonism that Protestant America found most anathema to American values,\npolygamy and theocracy. In 1893, Moroni trumpeted that intent to a still-skeptical but hopeful nation. Three years later, Utah\nwas admitted into the sisterhood of states and a rocky Mormon assimilation process was under way.\nThe westward-facing Nauvoo Temple and the eastward-facing Moroni at Salt Lake City signal both the Mormon withdrawal and\nsubsequent reengagement with the world that serve as bookends for this chapter. In the period between, Mormonism developed\nthe policies, practices, attitudes, and cultural attributes that came to typify the Utah Church in the nineteenth century and impact\nits form and function into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The Utah church that emerged from this crucible was in many\nways in transition as it entered the twentieth century, from communalism to capitalism, from polygamy to monogamy, from Old\nTestament Israelites to New Testament Christians, and from despised outcasts and racialized un-Americans to flag-waving,\napple-pie-eating, teetotaling, \u00fcber-Americans with a racial policy of their own. The transformation was gradual but stunning.\n(p. 40)\nExodus, Gathering, and Withdrawal\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 2 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nWhen the Mormons abandoned Nauvoo in 1846 they left not just their homes; they left the country whose ideals of religious\npluralism and freedom were enshrined in the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment. The Mormons had already forced\nProtestant America to test the boundaries of that clause in frontier practice, and eventually they would force Congress and the\nSupreme Court to test it in legal principle. As the Mormons trudged across Iowa and Indian country, the lessons of their short\nhistory must have resonated with every step, that contact with the outside world worked decidedly to their disadvantage. They\nwould therefore sever ties with the outside world and establish a religious kingdom isolated from Euro-American settlement and\nanchored in a restorationist cosmology.\nThe Great Basin became sacred space for Mormons and the new gathering place for its global missionary outreach. It was an\nisolated desert Zion, which included some of the driest expanses in the continental United States. In Brigham Young\u2019s mind it\nwas \u201ca good place to make Saints.\u201d He saw the benefit of an inhospitable region in both keeping outsiders away and sifting the\nwavering from the devout: \u201cMy soul feels hallelujah, it exults in God, that He has planted this people in a place that is not\ndesired by the wicked; for if the wicked come here they do not wish to stay, no matter how well they are treated, and I thank the\nLord for it. I want hard times,\u201d Young insisted, \u201cso that every person that does not wish to stay, for the sake of his religion, will\nleave.\u201d Young was satisfied with the Great Basin as \u201cthe place the Lord has appointed,\u201d and announced his intent to \u201cstay here\u201d\nuntil Jesus told the Saints \u201cto go somewhere else.\u201d 1\nThe first pioneers arrived in July of 1847 and by the spring of 1848 Young announced the Salt Lake valley as the new gathering\nplace for Mormon proselytes: \u201cTo all saints in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and adjacent islands and countries, we say\nemigrate as speedily as possible to this vicinity.\u201d 2 A follow-up announcement tapped into an Israelite identity: \u201cThe long looked\nfor time of gathering has come. Good tidings from Mount Zion! The resting place of Israel, for the last days, has been\ndiscovered.\u201d 3\nThe nineteenth-century doctrine of gathering became a central tenet of the faith and proved a crucial element in unifying\nMormonism\u2019s scattered flock. Conversion to Mormonism meant much more than changing where one worshipped on Sunday.\nFor many Mormons it dictated an international migration, a new climate and culture, and a conscious decision to abandon the\nperceived corrupting influences of Babylon. It brought together disparate Saints from a largely northern and western European\nharvest and made them into Mormons. It was an important element in forging a group identity, especially in distinguishing\nLatter-day Saints from Gentiles. The doctrine tightened internal bonds in direct correlation to seemingly constant opposition\nfrom without. As some historians have argued, it forged a new ethnicity out of a multicultural and polyglot people.\nMormon leaders urged a new identity upon a sometimes divided flock. In 1852, for example, two Mormon apostles,\nErastus Snow and Franklin Richards, visited a struggling economic mission sent to southern Utah to produce iron. They reported\n\u201cconsiderable excitement\u201d among the iron missionaries over problems of integrating former iron workers from Wales and\nPennsylvania. To the visiting authorities it seemed that the missionaries were divided along cultural lines and lacked unity and a\ncommon purpose. Snow wrote: \u201cwe found a Scotch party, a Welch party, an English party, and an American party, and we turned\nIron Masters and undertook to put all these through the furnace, and run out a party of Saints for building up the Kingdom of\nGod.\u201d Although Snow does not specify the means for such a process, broadly speaking it included the elevation of a Mormon\nidentity above any other. 4\n(p. 41)\nIt was a process that continued throughout the nineteenth century and signaled the Mormon effort to unify its people. In 1856,\nJedediah M. Grant put it succinctly: \u201cI like to see the English, the Scotch, Welsh, French, Danes, and men from every nation,\n5\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 3 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nkindred, tongue, and people, come forth and unite under the standard of truth, obey God and be one.\u201d 5 In the sermons at least,\nthe Saints\u2019 Mormon identity transcended former national and cultural ties and created a new sense of peoplehood.\nStill, the failed Deseret alphabet, foreign-language worship services and newspapers, nationalistic celebrations and holidays, as\nwell as public services available in foreign languages, all suggest that the desired assimilation had its limits. It raises intriguing\nquestions about the development of a distinctive Mormon identity and the impact that it might have had upon foreign\nimmigrants. What impact did immigrants have upon a developing Mormon ethnicity? Did they view themselves as Mormons\nfirst or did their Scotch, Irish, Swedish, or English cultural roots dominate? In what ways did Mormonism shape the immigrant\npopulations and in what ways did the immigrants shape Mormonism?\nBecause the gathering has dominated the story of the Utah church, the history of post-1847 Mormonism focuses on Salt Lake\nCity and the Mormon colonization of the intermountain West. It is a focus, however, that leaves the story of the ungathered\nSaints unexplored. What did it mean to be a Mormon in the nineteenth century if one stayed in Wales or Denmark or Scotland,\nor New Jersey or in the postbellum American South? Was it possible to forge a Mormon identity in small and isolated settings?\nWhat impact did staying behind have upon ritual, worship, and unity with those in the Great Basin? What did it mean for the\ninternational church when the significant strength of a congregation had gathered to Utah? Telling the story of the ungathered\nwill deepen the traditional story and further complicate the ways in which historians think about the emergence of a Mormon\nethnicity.\nGathering and colonizing the Great Basin was intimately intertwined with concern for the poor and less fortunate. Public works\nprojects, economic missions, such as the Iron and Cotton missions, Zion\u2019s Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), United\nOrder efforts, and monthly fasts with corresponding offerings to the poor were all facets of an economic withdrawal and\nevidence of ways in which Mormons attempted to insulate themselves from harsh market fluctuations. These initiatives were\nalso components (p. 42) of the Mormon effort to achieve economic self-sufficiency and create an egalitarian society with no\npoor among them. Of course their efforts met with varying success, but even failures serve as evidence of a commitment to\ncommunitarian ideals.\nThose ideals insisted that even the unfit, the poor, and the needy should gather to Zion and if they could not afford to do so,\ncommunal concern would provide a solution. For the gathering, that solution took the form of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund\nCompany (PEF), a revolving micro lender. It provided financial assistance to poor Saints gathering to Zion with the\nunderstanding that they would pay back the loan after arrival. Repayment would then fund a new immigrant\u2019s opportunity.\nAlthough the PEF ran heavily in debt due to the failure of many to repay, it nonetheless assisted thousands of Mormon converts\nto make their way to the Great Basin. To cut expenses, Mormon leaders in 1856 launched a new and subsequently storied\nversion of emigration via handcarts. In lieu of more expensive horses or oxen the converts would walk to Zion pulling their\nmeager possessions in the two-wheeled carts. Ten handcart companies made their way to Utah between 1856 and 1860, bringing\nroughly 3,000 Mormons to the Salt Lake Valley, only a small fraction of the estimated 70,000 Mormon immigrants who traveled\nto Utah before the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869.\nIn Mormon memory, however, the handcart migration has grown to occupy a disproportionate position. Handcarts have come to\nstand in for all forms of migration, and the two handcart tragedies, those of the James G. Willie and Edward Martin companies,\nhave come to stand in for all migrant companies. In 1856, the Willie and Martin companies left late in the season with green\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 4 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nhandcarts and were subsequently caught in an early Wyoming blizzard. Around 200 members of the two companies died before\nrescuers arrived.\nIn Mormon memory, the suffering and privation of those handcart pioneers symbolize faith in adversity and fortitude against\ngreat odds. In the twenty-first century, Mormon youth groups and congregations go on scripted handcart pulls, and during\nsummer months as many as 3,000 Mormons a week travel to Martin\u2019s Cove, Wyoming, to camp, square dance, and pull\nhandcarts in an effort to connect to a constructed version of sacred history. Handcart treks have become nearly universal rites of\npassage for youth groups in the United States and sometimes internationally, even though the vast majority of nineteenth-\ncentury Mormons emigrated via other means and even though the majority of those who came via handcart did not endure\ntragedies like those of the Willie and Martin companies.\nEngagement and Integration\nFor as much as the Mormons sought isolation, it was never fully possible. The dynamic that most powerfully shaped the\nMormon Utah experience involved a complex and shifting tension between isolation and separation on the one hand and the\ndesire for (p. 43) acceptance, belonging, and inclusion on the other. The one demanded severing of political, economic, social,\nand geographic ties, the other dictated engagement and contact in a protracted search for self-determination and religious liberty,\na search that included seven applications for statehood and considerable wrangling with the federal government as well as with\n\u201cGentiles\u201d or non-Mormons.\nThe first evidence of the impossibility of complete separation came even as the Mormons fled the United States in 1846. The US\nwar with Mexico erupted as the Mormons were stretched in camps across Iowa. Reaction to its outbreak offers a unique glimpse\ninto Mormon views of the nation they were then leaving. One Mormon, Hosea Stout, learned in May of the outbreak of war with\nMexico and recorded his feelings in his diary: \u201cI confess that I was glad to learn of war against the United States and was in\nhopes that it might never end until they were entirely destroyed for they had driven us into the wilderness & was now laughing\nat our calamities.\u201d 6\nTo add insult to injury, Captain James Allen, a US Army recruiter, appeared with authorization to enlist 500 men to serve in the\nUS war against Mexico. When Stout learned of this development, he saw it as a plot to harm the Mormons. If they did not join,\nit would reinforce suspicions of their disloyalty and brand them \u201cas enemies to our country,\u201d and if they did enlist, Stout\nsurmised, \u201cthey would then have 500 of our men in their power to be destroyed as they had done our leaders at Carthage.\u201d 7\nOther Mormons expressed similar reactions, with Abraham Day perhaps the most succinct when he wrote, \u201cHere is one man\nwho will not go, dam\u2019um.\u201d 8\nUnbeknown to those on the ground, Allen\u2019s recruitment efforts were actually the fruit of negotiations between President James\nK. Polk and Mormon agent Jessie Little. Little had requested federal aid to assist the Mormon exodus, and the enlistment\nopportunity resulted from his efforts. Brigham Young recognized the financial boon the enlistment represented and he in turn\nensured that Mormons filled the 500-man quota.\nHere then, at the very moment of their flight from the United States, the Mormons agreed to enlist in the US Army. It is a\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 5 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nmoment that captures the central paradox of the Mormon experience in the Great Basin, the desire for autonomy coexisting with\nthe desire for belonging. To be sure there was a significant amount of self-interest bound up in the Mormon enlistment, but the\nMormons nonetheless were fond of reminding federal officials of their service in the war with Mexico as evidence of their\nloyalty to the nation, especially when they felt the crushing weight of federal power bearing down upon them. Ultimately, those\ncompeting forces found expression in multiple applications for Utah statehood. Statehood offered sovereignty, especially in the\nantebellum period, and autonomy to define marriage laws. Statehood also meant equal footing in the sisterhood of states.\nHistorians debate the degree and nature of Mormon desires for separation, with some suggesting it was a full-blown effort at\npolitical and religious independence, an independent Mormon theocracy, or even an effort at \u201cworld dominion.\u201d 9 Others view a\nmore nuanced and complex relationship with federal authority, one that captures both the Mormon desire to establish a godly\nkingdom in preparation for Christ\u2019s imminent return, and the Mormons\u2019 vision of themselves as the true preservers of republican\nprinciples. In (p. 44) 1852, Brigham Young expressed his devotion to the Declaration of Independence and Constitution as \u201cthe\nsafe guard of our liberties, and for our protection. We not only cordially support its principles, but will defend it with our utmost\nendeavors, physical, or otherwise, whenever required.\u201d 10 By 1856, however, Young grew dissatisfied with the federal territorial\nsystem, announcing to a Mormon congregation, \u201cI say, as the Lord lives, we are bound to become a sovereign State in the\nUnion, or an independent nation by ourselves, and let them drive us from this place if they can; they cannot do it.\u201d 11\nToo frequently such statements are taken out of context, both from the entirety of a speech, and from the broader history of the\nUS West. Young\u2019s speech in 1856, for example, was laced with Mormon millenarian references suggesting that in due course\nearthly power did not matter because Jesus would return and assume control: \u201cThose who vote for Jesus will be on the right\nhand, and those who vote for Lucifer on the left. \u2026 We are going to vote for the sovereign we believe in; and when he comes\nbehold he will go into the chair of state and take the reins of government.\u201d Young predicted that \u201cJesus Christ will be the\nPresident, and we are his officers.\u201d 12 It was Jesus to whom Young swore final loyalty. Republicans and Democrats were\nirrelevant in his cosmic vision. Young viewed his call as a divine mandate to preserve an embattled people, mold them into\nSaints, and with them establish God\u2019s kingdom on earth in anticipation of Jesus\u2019 return.\nFrom the outside looking in, however, the sometimes fiery Mormon rhetoric sounded alarm bells and touched off fears of\ntreason and rebellion. Mormon William I. Appleby had difficulty understanding that response. He wrote to Brigham Young from\nNew York, in October 1857, as federal troops marched on Utah and a reported Mormon rebellion commanded national attention:\n\u201cThere is a great excitement here in relation to Utah, and any news from that quarter is sought after with great anxiety by press\nand people, and the cry is \u2018down with the Mormons, use them up,\u2019 \u2018blot them out\u2019 &c.\u201d What perplexed Appleby most was a lack\nof understanding about Mormon devotion to the United States. \u201cThey do not know the Mormons[;]\u200b they are the best friends of\nthis Government, its constitution, and its laws, and feel willing to protect and defend them,\u201d he explained. Appleby made a\ndistinction between the Constitution and those who administered it and, like Young, placed his utmost trust in God: \u201cI love my\ncountry and its constitution, but I hate and despise demagogues. Come what will, all is well and all is right with those who put\ntheir trust in their god, and relies upon his Almighty arm.\u201d 13 In essence, Mormons swore allegiance to the Constitution and the\nUnited States even as they saw its governments as corrupt and oppressive.\nBecause the Mormon desire for self-determination was frequently couched in religious language, historians have sometimes\nexaggerated its exceptional aspects and failed to situate the Mormon experience within the broader history of the US West. In\nfact, the American West was rife with calls for self-rule, especially as many westerners viewed the territorial system as\noppressive, little better than the British colonialism that Americans had overthrown. The appointment of outsiders to territorial\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 6 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\npositions was particularly troubling in the West. In 1869, for example, when James M. Ashley, former congressman from\nToledo, Ohio, was appointed governor of Montana Territory, The Independent of Deer Lodge, Montana, called Ashley a \u201ccarpet-\nbagger\u201d and a \u201cbroken down political hack.\u201d The newspaper wondered \u201chow long are the people to be scorned and insulted by\nbeing told, by implication at least, that there is not one among the thirty thousand freemen of Montana who is capable of\ndischarging the functions of the executive office?\u201d 14 That same year, in a more general criticism about the territorial system, the\nIdaho Statesman expressed frustration over political neglect and ignorance of the West: the \u201cCommittee on Territories is\ncomposed of men, who with one or two exceptions, never saw a Territory, much less lived in one long enough to appreciate its\npeculiar necessities.\u201d 15 Mormons, in other words, were far from unique in their desire for self-rule or in their frustration with the\n(p. 45)\nterritorial system. It was when the Mormons mixed their frustrations with sometimes bombastic religious rhetoric and strident\ndefenses of polygamy that politicians in Washington, DC, and the Protestant majority in America resisted.\nIn no case was this truer than that of the Utah War. By 1857, United States president James Buchanan became convinced that\nUtah Territory under Governor Brigham Young was in a state of rebellion. Without communicating his intent, Buchanan\ndetermined to replace Young as governor, send a 2,500-man army to Utah to suppress rebellion, and install new territorial\nofficials. Young, in turn, viewed the advancing army through a glass darkly and filtered through previous persecution. He treated\nthe troops as an invading army. The result was an avoidable episode that grew into the most extensive and expensive military\noperation between the US war with Mexico and the Civil War, and it was aimed at American citizens. Cooler heads eventually\nprevailed and the conflict ended with no pitched battles between Mormons and federal forces, but the heightened atmosphere\nproved deadly for groups whom the Mormons became convinced were allied with government forces or whom they demonized\nas the enemy.\nThe Mountain Meadows Massacre was the most bloody of the violent episodes to grow out of the Utah War. Southern Utah\nMormons induced members of the Baker-Fancher party, a group of immigrants passing through Utah on their way to California,\nto give up their weapons under a flag of truce and then murdered them after promising protection. Mormons killed 120 innocent\nmen, women, and children, on September 11, 1857. Postmassacre justifications focused upon the provocative nature of the\nBaker-Fancher party\u2019s interactions with Mormons at Cedar City. They included accounts of the emigrant party insulting\nMormon leaders, speaking provokingly of prior atrocities committed against Mormons, or suggesting that they would send an\narmy to Utah from California after they arrived. Those stories, if nothing else, only confirm the heightened sense of fear that\npermeated southern Utah in the face of an impending federal invasion. Those fears led southern Utah leaders from one bad\ndecision to the next until they became convinced that the Baker-Fancher party was a threat to their continued safety and needed\nto be destroyed.\nSince 1857, Mormons, government investigators, descendants of the victims and of the perpetrators, as well as historians have\nstruggled to understand such horrific violence, made more difficult to explain because it involved whites killing whites, with no\neasy racial answer self-evident. Adding to the complexity of the issue, especially for subsequent generations of Mormons, is the\neffort to understand how their pioneer co-religionists could violate fundamental aspects of the Christian gospel, the divine\nmandate to \u201crenounce war and proclaim peace\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants [D&C] 98:16), (p. 46) to rescue and aid the less\nfortunate, to turn the other cheek, and to \u201cforgive all men\u201d (D&C 64:10). Instead, Mormons at Mountain Meadows lied and\nmurdered in a cowardly manner and then attempted to cover their crimes with silence and blame shifting.\nWhile historians generally agree on a timeline, their interpretations and explanations of events vary widely. Where Juanita\nBrooks described the massacre as a tragic byproduct of the Utah War and an overzealous response to the impending federal\n16\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 7 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\ninvasion, Will Bagley sees it as the natural outgrowth of a Mormon \u201cculture of violence.\u201d 16 More recently Ronald Walker,\nRichard Turley, and Glen Leonard situate the decisions for the massacre in southern Utah. They see events spiraling out of\ncontrol as hot-headed southern leaders linked the Baker-Fancher party with federal troops and dehumanized them as an enemy\nin need of elimination. 17\nMuch of the contention animating massacre historiography centers upon the extent of Young\u2019s involvement. Historians also\ndebate the nature of Southern Paiute participation in the siege and at the massacre. Those controversies, however, cloud more\ndifficult questions, especially because no single narrative will satisfy the various constituencies who are so heavily invested in\nthe event. Although no evidence to date implicates Young in ordering the massacre, the full complexity of moral responsibility\nand the heightened sense of obedience to authority that created an atmosphere ripe for deterioration into fanaticism remains\nunderexplored. The bombastic sermons from the Mormon Reformation of 1856\u201357 hung heavily in the air, especially talk of\nblood atonement and harsh language aimed at apostates and backsliders. Factor in the failure to hold accountable the\nperpetrators of the Santa Clara ambush and the Parish-Potter murders, or at the very least to denounce those events as clear\nviolations of the standards expected of Latter-day Saints, and then add in an impending federal invasion with Mormon memories\nof previous persecutions, and the stage was set.\nWhy did not more southern Utah Mormons refuse the order to murder? What did the Mormon culture of obedience look like and\nwhat did those in southern Utah believe that disobedience might mean? Questions also remain regarding the postmassacre\ncover-up. How might the impact of the massacre been different if justice stern and severe had been meted out to the\nperpetrators? John D. Lee was the only participant held accountable for the massacre when he was tried and then executed by\nfiring squad in 1877. While Mormon-federal tension complicated the issue, a clear denunciation of the massacre from LDS\nleaders could have sent a strong message that those involved not only violated the law, but the standards of what it meant to be a\nLatter-day Saint. Absent such decisive messages, the massacre remained a taboo topic, at least until Juanita Brooks wrote about\nit in 1950, to the discomfort of some Latter-day Saints. It was not until 2007 that the LDS Church officially addressed the event\nin its publications. In 2011 the massacre site was designated a National Historic Landmark, a move that may neutralize ongoing\ntension over who controls the land and how to memorialize the victims.\nFollowing the Utah War, federal troops remained in Utah. Although those troops were quickly called east at the outbreak of the\nCivil War, President Abraham Lincoln did not fully trust the Mormons. Replacement forces, volunteers from California,\nestablished Fort Douglas on the bench overlooking Salt Lake City and formed a permanent federal (p. 47) presence in the\nterritory. Still, the end of the Utah War marked a shift in federal policy toward the Mormons, away from a military solution to a\nlegislative and judicial solution. Congress largely viewed Mormon polygamy and theocracy as a two-headed monster and was\nintent upon severing both heads. The first antipolygamy legislation passed Congress in 1862. Over the ensuing nearly three\ndecades, Congress proposed and sometimes passed legislation designed to force a Mormon surrender and ultimately to make the\nLatter-day Saints into acceptable Americans. The Mormons in turn claimed protection for polygamy as a religious principle\nunder the free-exercise clause of the Constitution. Congress maintained its role as gatekeeper, making it clear that Mormonism\ndid not fit prevailing ideals about what it meant to be an American.\nThe Supreme Court weighed in on the matter in 1879, in United States v. Reynolds, a decision which denied a constitutional\nshield for polygamy. The court held unanimously that the Constitution protected religious belief, not practice, and thereby paved\nthe way for increasingly stringent federal action.\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 8 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nThe Reynolds decision ushered in an era of Mormon civil disobedience, which pushed polygamists into hiding in an elaborate\n\u201cunderground\u201d network of safe houses designed to shield them from arrest. It was only in 1890, after the Supreme Court opened\nthe door for the confiscation of LDS temple properties, that Mormon resolve weakened. LDS president Wilford Woodruff\narticulated the difficult choice he faced between two important elements of Mormon religious life, temples and polygamy. For\nMormons temples represent the highest manifestation of their devotion to their God, and when the government threatened to\nconfiscate the St. George, Manti, and Logan temples, Woodruff blinked. On September 24, 1890, he announced the Manifesto,\ndeclaring his intention to submit to the law of the land and to use his influence with his Mormon flock to \u201chave them do\nlikewise\u201d (D&C Official Declaration 1). Mormon leadership also adopted the national two-party political system. In the wake of\nthese reforms, two US presidents issued successive proclamations of amnesty and in 1896 President Grover Cleveland\nproclaimed Utah the forty-fifth state.\nLinking the abandonment of polygamy to statehood, however, obscures the real tradeoff. There was no quid pro quo agreement\nbetween the federal government and Mormon leaders, no trading polygamy for statehood. For almost forty years after they\noutlawed polygamy, Congress had consistently impressed upon the Mormons the necessity of abandoning it, but Mormons still\nclung tenaciously to \u201cthe Principle.\u201d Even after Woodruff issued the Manifesto, statehood was still almost six years away. The\nmost immediate tradeoff was internal, the abandonment of polygamy to preserve temple worship.\nEven with temples hanging in the balance, the abandonment of polygamy was wrenching, especially for individual Mormons\nwho had sacrificed to defend it and who now had to find new paths forward. The federal government was generally willing to let\nexisting plural marriages die out so long as new marriages did not take place. Although federal authorities did expect Mormons\nto stop \u201ccohabitating\u201d with plural wives, they did not punish offenders with the same zeal as before the Manifesto.\nFor polygamous Mormons it was a bewildering new world without clear directives from LDS leaders. Some Mormons breathed\na sigh of relief that the long tension with (p. 48) the federal government was coming to an end. Others viewed Woodruff\u2019s\nmanifesto as a capitulation to political pressure and labeled him a fallen prophet; they refused to abandon polygamy. B. Carmon\nHardy has documented over 200 cases of post-Manifesto plural marriage, including those of seven members of the Quorum of\nTwelve Apostles. Still others refused to abandon existing families and continued to cohabit with plural wives. Even church\npresident Joseph F. Smith pled guilty to unlawful cohabitation in 1906, and was fined $300. The transformation was dramatic,\nfrom monogamy to polygamy and back to monogamy in less than seventy years.\nThe Americanization process was still not complete and polygamy still not fully ended. When Utahns elected polygamist B. H.\nRoberts to the US House of Representatives in 1898, Congress refused to seat him. The real test came, however, in 1903 when\nReed Smoot, a monogamist and sitting LDS apostle, was elected to the US Senate. Charges of continuing plural marriage,\ndevotion to priestly rule over devotion to the Constitution, and church control of politics in Utah promoted Senate hearings that\nstretched over three years and put the entire Mormon church on trial. In the end Smoot retained his seat, but the hearings forced\nthe hand of LDS leadership. Joseph F. Smith ducked and weaved in his testimony before the Senate and then issued what\nhistorians refer to as the \u201cSecond Manifesto.\u201d He proclaimed excommunication as the penalty for future plural marriages. Two\nparticularly determined defenders of polygamy, sitting LDS apostles Matthias Cowley and John W. Taylor, were dropped from\nthe Quorum, and after 1910 the church actively excommunicated those entering plural marriage, a policy it continues in the\ntwenty-first century. Splinter groups committed to the continuation of polygamy emerged from this context, forming their own\nchurches.\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 9 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nPolygamy, once preached as the ideal marriage system and taught as a sacrament essential for exaltation, was difficult to leave\nbehind. Contemporary Mormon sensitivity to polygamy stems from a variety of concerns. Feminist sensibilities, genuine\nabhorrence of the practice, and the ever-present concern among Mormon leaders for the public image of the faith cultivate a\ndesire to dismiss lingering misperceptions that Mormon men in the twenty-first century have more than one wife. The HBO\nseries Big Love, which ran from 2006 to 2011, along with reality television shows, add to the confusion, as does news attention\ngiven to fundamentalist splinter groups which continue to practice polygamy outside of the LDS Church.\nA Struggle for Whiteness\nHistorians most frequently characterize the nineteenth-century Utah experience as an Americanization process, whereby\nMormons shed polygamy and theocracy in a struggle for statehood and broader acceptance. While that characterization is\naccurate, it obscures the ways in which the Mormon story can be recast as a struggle for whiteness. Like other marginalized\ngroups in the nineteenth century, the Protestant white majority racialized Mormons as somehow less than white. The\nracialization that Mormons (p. 49) endured never reached the same level as that employed against African Americans, but fell\nsomewhere between hard racism and full acceptance.\nWhiteness in the nineteenth century meant access to power, acceptability, and the full privileges of citizenship. Senator John C.\nCalhoun, in late 1847, asserted on the floor of the US Senate that America \u201cis the Government of a white race.\u201d 18 It was a\nsentiment consistently reinforced in policy and practice even after the Civil War and the end of Reconstruction, when white\nSoutherners reinstated racial supremacy through Jim Crow laws and the Supreme Court stamped its approval on the idea of\n\u201cseparate but equal.\u201d Within that broader and shifting racial context, outsiders looked at the Mormon body and concluded that\nMormons were not just religiously, but physically different; as such they were unfit for the blessings of democracy.\nThe most explicit and provocative enunciation of this racialization came from two medical doctors whose reports were widely\ndistributed in medical journals. In 1860, Dr. Roberts Bartholow, a US Army doctor, argued that Mormon polygamy was giving\nrise to a \u201cnew race,\u201d so degraded, deformed, and degenerate that one could \u201cdistinguish\u201d it \u201cat a glance.\u201d 19 Three years later, Dr.\nCharles C. Furley likewise described the Mormon body as \u201cmean and sensual to the point of absolute ugliness.\u201d 20 Other\nobservers conflated white Mormons with Indians, blacks, and Asians in a process designed to justify discriminatory policies\nagainst Mormons and suggest that they were more like the other \u201cundesirable\u201d groups than they were white.\nMormons were aware of these assertions and responded with a racialized rhetoric of their own. In 1868, Mormon leader George\nQ. Cannon insisted that \u201chere in these [Utah] valleys, we shall raise a race of men who will be the joy of the earth, whose\ncomplexions will be the complexions of angels.\u201d 21 Neither side questioned that a marriage system could give rise to a new race,\nthey only debated its outcome. It is a powerful commentary on race as a social construct and on the shifting, fluid, and\nfrequently illogical way in which nineteenth-century Americans imagined it.\nThe racialization of Mormons places Mormonism\u2019s own troubled history with race in a different light. When the Mormons\narrived in the Great Basin in 1847 there was no racial priesthood policy in place. Blacks were among the earliest converts to\nMormonism and at least two black men were ordained to the Mormon priesthood prior to 1847. One of the ordinations, that of\nElijah Abel, was sanctioned by Joseph Smith, himself. Abel served at least three proselytizing missions for the church and\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 10 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nremained devout throughout his life.\nIt was Brigham Young in 1852 who publicly announced a priesthood restriction based upon his belief that blacks belonged to a\ndivinely cursed lineage traceable through Cain and Ham. In doing so, Young borrowed from long-standing Judeo-Christian ideas\nthat predated Mormonism by several centuries. Young and other Mormon leaders employed those ideas to their own ends. In a\nself-reinforcing process that stretched across the course of the nineteenth century they created and then reinforced race-based\npriesthood and temple restrictions. In 1908 LDS president Joseph F. Smith solidified those restrictions with a false memory that\nforgot the black priesthood holders of the early church and wrongly suggested that the ban had always been in place. LDS\nleaders (p. 50) thereby distanced the institutional church from its own black converts. It was a process that repeated itself outside\nMormonism in a variety of ways as white Americans across the nation reasserted supremacy in the wake of black freedom.\nFear of interracial mixing also permeated nineteenth-century America and took form in a variety of miscegenation laws. Utah\u2019s\n1852 \u201cservant\u201d code included a clause prohibiting \u201cany white person\u201d from \u201csexual intercourse with any of the African race.\u201d\nBrigham Young further declared to a Mormon audience in 1863 that \u201cIf the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his\nblood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot.\u201d Such alarm over race mixing made Young\nmore American than uniquely Mormon, especially as Americans moved to enforce racial separation in the aftermath of the Civil\nWar and black freedom. In Arkansas, as legislators there contemplated the issue, one lawmaker argued for a provision that\nstipulated \u201cif any white man shall be found cohabiting with a negro woman, the penalty shall be death.\u201d Even some Native\nAmerican tribes distanced themselves from blacks. The Choctaw General Council declared it a felony for a Choctaw to marry a\nblack, while Creek leaders stated that it was \u201ca disgrace to our nation for our people to marry a Negro.\u201d\nIn essence, marginalized groups across the nation clamored for position on America\u2019s hierarchical racial ladder, Mormons\nincluded. The Mormon struggle for whiteness occurred in the face of its own racialization at the hands of outsiders, especially as\noutsiders came to view polygamy as not just a threat to the traditional family, but a threat to the white race. Political cartoons\nfeatured a black wife among a Mormon man\u2019s \u201charem,\u201d or black children as the offspring of polygamy. One antipolygamy\nwriter even turned the mark of Cain back on the Mormons, a sign of the degenerative effects of polygamy upon women:\n\u201cEspecially do the first wives seem to carry the signs of care and sorrow,\u2014a mark of Cain, as it were, which separates them\nfrom the rest of their kind. It is perceptible to even the most transient visitors, and those who tarry for any length of time can\nreadily distinguish a Mormon woman from an outsider.\u201d\nThe irony here is that by the turn of the century Utah had already adopted its own antimiscegenation law and Mormons barred\nblack men from the priesthood and black women and men from LDS temple worship. While membership remained open to\npeople of all races, the highest sacraments of Mormonism were in essence segregated. These internal policies took shape against\na backdrop in which outsiders portrayed Mormons as racially impure. The Mormon response was an attempt to claim whiteness\nfor Mormonism that solidified into a racial policy by the early twentieth century and did not end until 1978.\nTemples and Lived Religion\nWhile Mormonism\u2019s ongoing tension with the United States offers a compelling way of viewing the major events engaging the\nUtah Church, it simultaneously neglects Mormonism\u2019s internal development: transitions and changes in ritual, the creation\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 11 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\nof new organizational programs, the shedding of doctrines, and aspects of Mormon lived religion, all of which directly\nimpacted the average Saint in the nineteenth century.\n(p. 51)\nWilford Woodruff, for example, not only issued the Manifesto ending polygamy but also ended the law of adoption, a practice\nunfamiliar to most modern-day Mormons. In its place, Woodruff instituted genealogy and family history, something that grew\ninto a central tenet of Mormonism in the twentieth century. Charismatic gifts of the spirit such as speaking in tongues also\ntransitioned over time. Those gifts attracted some converts to early Mormonism and found continued and vibrant expression in\nthe Great Basin. Their practice, however, diminished and all but disappeared after the turn of the twentieth century. Modern\nMormons tend to think of the gift of tongues as divine help for missionaries learning a foreign language rather than a spiritual\nmanifestation in worship. Female ritual healing also diminished, as did baptisms for health and rebaptisms in general. Brigham\nYoung\u2019s ideas about blood atonement were formally rejected in an 1889 First Presidency manifesto, and Young\u2019s successors\ndistanced themselves from his identification of Adam as humanity\u2019s God.\nThe Church also adopted new programs: it formalized its Sunday school initiative, added organizations for youth and children,\nand formally reinstituted the Relief Society. Perhaps the most important development in the territorial period had to do with the\narchitectural and liturgical distinction between Sunday worship and weekday temple worship. Almost from the beginning,\nMormons were a temple-building people but they did not routinely build chapels for Sunday worship before coming to the Great\nBasin. The Kirtland Temple was something of an anomaly, a hybrid between what would formalize as separate worship facilities\nin Utah. Joseph Smith\u2019s focus was so intent upon temple construction that Sunday worship facilities were an afterthought that\nonly formally developed in the intermountain West. The temple ritual also developed over time. It was at St. George in 1877 that\ntemple worship first included patrons performing all of the present rituals of the LDS temple, not just for the living but also by\nproxy for the dead.\nIn conjunction with these developments, Mormons began to build chapels for weekly Sunday services. As Mormons founded\nnew communities spread across the intermountain West, the need for local meeting places prompted the building of chapels.\nThese structures were much smaller and less elaborate than temples, and frequently served weekday functions, such as\nschoolhouse, a place for dances, meetings, celebrations, funerals, and dinners, in addition to Sunday worship. Chapels were\nalways open to visitors of other faiths or of no faith, whereas after dedication temples are reserved for Mormons who meet\nspecified standards of conduct.\nTemple worship as a fully articulated proxy work for the dead and a corresponding focus upon family history are among the\nmost enduring legacies of the Utah territorial phase. They represent a central component of the Mormon experience which\npassed into the twenty-first century and served to set Mormons apart from other Christian denominations. Temples captured the\nimagination and devotion of nineteenth-century\nand then sacrificed polygamy to keep them.\n(p. 52)\nMormon pioneers who sacrificed time, money, and labor to build them,\nThe Salt Lake Temple\u2019s completion in 1893 marked both the continued centrality of temples to Mormonism and important\ntransformations then underway. Mormons were three years into their difficult extraction from polygamy, they were integrating\nthemselves economically and politically into the national mainstream, and in other ways they demonstrated a willingness to shed\ntheir distinctiveness and to Americanize. Yet Mormons clung to certain aspects of peculiarity and withdrawal. The completed\nSalt Lake Temple represented a purely religious withdrawal, but a withdrawal nonetheless, a retreat into the solace of sacred\nspace, and an ongoing desire to seek and encounter the divine. Rather than gather to the Great Basin, Mormons thereafter would\nhttps://www-oxfordhandbooks-com.erl.lib.byu.edu/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199778362.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199778362-e-4?print\nPage 12 of 17Mormon Church in Utah - Oxford Handbooks\n1/4/22, 7:03 PM\ngather to temples. The fiery rhetoric of blood and justice were gone, the millenarian fervor tempered, and the grandiose visions\nof a religious kingdom subsumed. Moroni\u2019s eastward-facing trump atop the tallest spire of the Salt Lake Temple sounded a call\nto all nations that primitive Christianity was restored and that Zion was established anew. It signaled an invitation to enter sacred\ntemple space and therein experience a diminished but persistent Mormon desire to be in the world but not of it.\nBibliography\nAlexander, Thomas G.

Because of iniquity, dissensions, and intrigue, they found themselves in the most dangerous of circumstances (see Alma 53:9). The government teetered on the brink of collapse. The war with the Lamanite nation had been ongoing for years. Nephite dissidents were leaving to join forces with the enemy. Many Nephite cities had been attacked and captured.\nIn the midst of this dangerous and chaotic situation, righteous men were sought after to lead the Nephite armies\u2014men like Moroni and Helaman. These Nephite leaders understood that their nation\u2019s ability to defend itself was in direct proportion to their obedience to the Lord. They constantly struggled to motivate the population to remember the Lord and keep His commandments.\nAt this very critical point in time, after many Nephite cities had been lost and the balance of power seemed to be shifting towards the Lamanites, a miraculous thing took place. A group of people, once Lamanites, now known as Ammonites because they were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ through the teachings of Ammon, came forward desirous to take up arms in the defense of their newly inherited land, country, and way of life (see Alma 53:13).\nThe fathers of these Ammonite families had previously made an oath to the Lord never to take up arms again. Helaman, the Nephite prophet, counseled these men to keep their promise to the Lord (see Alma 53:15). Helaman relates what transpired after he shared that counsel:\n\u201cBut behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.\n\u201cAnd they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty. \u2026\n\u201cNow behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country. \u2026\n\u201cAnd they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all\u2014they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.\n\u201cYea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.\n\u201cAnd now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people\u201d (Alma 53:16\u201318, 20\u201322).\nHelaman and his 2,000 stripling soldiers fought valiantly to protect their families and their liberty. Their entrance onto the field of battle changed the course of the war. Momentum swung back in favor of the Nephites.\nIn a letter written to Moroni, Helaman describes the faith and courage these young men exhibited:\n\u201cAnd now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites. \u2026\n\u201cNow they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them\u201d (Alma 56:45, 47).\nBrothers and sisters, \u201cthey did not doubt, [and] God [did] deliver them.\u201d In their first great battle, not one of the 2,000 was slain. After the battle, 60 more young Ammonite men joined the small army. Helaman tells us \u201cthey did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them\u201d (Alma 57:21).\nThe second battle in which this small army was engaged was more intense than the first. In its aftermath Helaman writes:\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, \u2026 there was not one soul of them who did perish. \u2026\n\u201cAnd now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, \u2026 And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith\u201d (Alma 57:25\u201326).\nHelaman and his young stripling soldiers understood the importance of making covenants with the Lord. They were also recipients of the blessings that come to those who faithfully keep their covenants.\nAs members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have also taken upon ourselves sacred obligations. We have done this in the waters of baptism and in the temples of the Lord. We call these obligations covenants. Covenants are promises we make to the Lord. They are extremely sacred in nature. The most important thing we can do in this life is to keep the promises or covenants we have made with the Lord. When we keep our promises to the Lord, He allows us to progress spiritually.\nDuring the past two years, Sister Maynes and I have been assigned to serve in the Philippines. We have come across many examples of Filipino families and individuals who understand and keep the covenants they have made with the Lord. Let me share with you an experience that we have had with one of these families.\nA few months ago I was assigned to preside at the Talisay Philippines Stake conference. During the Sunday general session, I began my talk by thanking the congregation for their reverence. While speaking, I looked down to my left and saw a very large family sitting a couple of rows back from the front of the chapel. I was impressed to point them out and use them as an example of a family who understood and lived the principle of reverence. The parents were sitting there surrounded by many, many reverent children.\nUpon the completion of the meeting, we had the wonderful opportunity to meet the Abasanta family. The more I learned about them, the more I was impressed with the fact that they truly understood what it meant to keep covenants and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nBrother Lani and Sister Irenea Abasanta joined the Church 22 years ago. Together, they have had 17 children. Among the 17 children is one set of triplets. We all know that raising a family is not an easy task anywhere in the world, and the Philippines is no exception. The Abasanta family is a living example that it can be done, and it can be done in the right way.\nThe successes they have enjoyed raising their children in the Church are made manifest in many ways. A family of 19 sitting reverently through Church meetings is just one example.\nAnother example is illustrated by how they work hard and how they work together to meet their everyday financial needs. Brother Abasanta works as an electrician. Sister Abasanta, with the help of her daughters, makes and sells jewelry out of their home. Together, they have succeeded in providing the necessities of life for their family.\nEven more important than their example in supporting their large family financially is how they teach their children to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Their regular family home evenings play an essential part in the teaching of their family. Referring to their family home evenings, Brother Abasanta explained, \u201cFirst we discuss any problems we might have in the family and how we can become more united; then there is a spiritual thought or lesson; then we play games.\u201d\nAt a recent family home evening, Brother Abasanta used the Liahona magazine as a tool to help him teach his children not to spend so much time watching television but instead to use that time doing something of greater worth, like homework or reading the scriptures. Over the years during family home evenings the children have been taught to practice being reverent. Because their children have been taught to be reverent in their home, it is easier for them to demonstrate reverence at church on Sunday.\nAnother example of living the gospel and keeping their covenants is the priority they have given in teaching their children the importance of paying an honest and full tithing. Brother Abasanta stated: \u201cWe teach our children that the food we have is a direct result of paying tithing. When our kids have their own work, we make sure to tell them that they need to pay their tithing. It\u2019s hard to provide for so many children, but when I pay my tithing faithfully and honestly, it\u2019s not hard at all. We just trust in the Lord 100 percent that if we pay an honest tithing, we\u2019ll be able to eat daily.\u201d\nRemember that I mentioned that Brother and Sister Abasanta have 17 children. Now, let me tell you about the triplets. They happen to be all boys. They happen to be 19 years old. Their names are Ammon, Omni, and Omner. Yes, you guessed it. All three are serving the Lord as faithful and hard-working full-time missionaries. Ammon is serving in the Philippines Baguio Mission, Omni is serving in the Philippines Davao Mission, and Omner is serving in the Philippines Manila Mission.\nNow I do not want you to get the impression that the Abasanta family is perfect. None of us are perfect. However, by trying their best to live the commandments and keep their covenants, the Abasanta family is able to enjoy the blessings of the Lord in their lives.\nBrothers and sisters, we are all looking forward to the day when we can return home to our Heavenly Father. In order to qualify for exaltation in the celestial kingdom, we must gain the trust of the Lord here on earth. We gain the trust of the Lord through earning it, and that is accomplished through our actual performance in living His gospel and keeping our covenants. In other words, we earn the trust of the Lord by doing His will.\nRemember when the Lord warned Joseph Smith regarding those who \u201cdraw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me\u201d (JS\u2014H 1:19).\nRemember the admonition of James: \u201cBut be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only\u201d (James 1:22).\nActions truly do speak louder than words. In fact, actions mean much more to the Lord than words. The Lord declared in the Doctrine and Covenants, \u201cIf thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments\u201d (D&C 42:29).\nHelaman and his young stripling soldiers are an ancient illustration of the blessings that come to those who faithfully keep their promises to the Lord. The Abasanta family is a modern-day example of a family doing their best to keep their covenants and live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nAll members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have made promises to the Lord. We have promised to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments (see D&C 20:77). Faithful members of the Church keep those promises.\nIt is my prayer today that we might all recommit ourselves to do everything in our power to earn the trust of the Lord by doing His will, by living His gospel, and by keeping our covenants, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRichard J. Maynes\nKeeping Our Covenants\n2004\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My brothers and sisters, as I stand at the pulpit of this old but new Tabernacle, I am overwhelmed with the sense of history I feel at this moment. As one foot is planted in the past and the other in the future, I give thanks for pioneer and modern-day prophets and apostles who have had and still have the vision to construct and extend into the future this remarkable building.\nI wish to speak of two such men of vision: Brigham Young and his successor today.\nBrigham Young was the second prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He led the Church for 33 years. He built this Tabernacle and presided at its dedication during the October general conference in 1875, more than 131 years ago.\nHis other accomplishments were many, and I can refer to only a few.\nHe was a pioneer, meaning someone who opens or prepares the way for others to follow. One writer said of Brigham Young: \u201cHe led a ragged and impoverished band, stripped of virtually all their earthly goods, into an unknown territory. His critics and biographers note that the man was unique among the leaders of modern history, for he alone, without any political and financial backing, established from scratch in the desert an ordered and industrious society, having no other authority than the priesthood and the spiritual strength with which he delivered his teachings. By constant exhortations and instructions, he drew his people together and inspired them in carrying out the divine mandate to build up the kingdom of God on earth.\u201d1\nWhen Brigham Young first entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake, he declared, \u201cThis is the right place.\u201d2 He later said:\n\u201cGod has shown me, that this is the spot to locate his people, and here is where they will prosper; he will temper the elements to the good of the Saints; he will rebuke the frost and the sterility of the soil, and the land shall become fruitful, \u2026 and we shall build a city and a temple to the most high God in this place.\u201d3\nToday, we can all attest to the truth of this prophecy. Truly, the desert land and the valleys of the Rocky Mountains are a fruitful and a productive land of promise and prophecy.\nHe built temples. He started the Salt Lake Temple, which took 40 years to complete. He also started the Manti and the Logan Temples. He dedicated the St. George Temple 4 1/2 months before he died.\nHe was one of America\u2019s greatest colonizers. By the time of his death, nearly 400 colonies had been established.\nHe organized the Perpetual Emigrating Fund to reach out to those in need, assisting those of limited means in emigrating from countries in Europe.\nHe established universities. The University of Deseret is now known as the University of Utah. Latter-day Saints\u2019 College is now known as LDS Business College. And, of course, he also established Brigham Young University.\nHe loved the Church and its members. Brigham Young had a unique way in which he referred to the Church:\n\u201cGod is at the helm. This is the mighty ship Zion. You stick to the ship and honor it, and see that you are in favor with the ship Zion and you need not worry about anything else. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 He guides the ship, and will bring us safely into port. All we have to care about is to take care of ourselves and see that we do right. Let us man the ship manfully, everyone standing faithfully and firmly to his post, and she will outride every storm and safely bear us to the harbor of celestial bliss.\u201d4\nHe loved the youth of the Church, as is evidenced by the experience of Heber J. Grant. Nine days after Heber\u2019s birth, his father, Jedediah M. Grant, who was Second Counselor to President Brigham Young, died. For the next 21 years, Brigham Young took special interest in the boy Heber J. Grant.\nHeber J. Grant wrote:\n\u201cI was almost as familiar in the homes of President Brigham Young as I was in the home of my own mother. In one home \u2026 if I was hungry I felt as free to go in and ask for something to eat there as in my own home. \u2026 I knelt down time and time again in his home in the Lion House at family prayers, as a child and as a young man.\u201d5\nHe loved the Prophet Joseph Smith. Of this, he said:\n\u201cWhat I have received from the Lord, I have received by Joseph Smith.\u201d6\n\u201cI love his doctrine. \u2026 I feel like shouting Hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith.\u201d7\nHow I love Brigham Young. His modern-day successor is President Gordon B. Hinckley, also a beloved and revered prophet.\nA beautiful painting shows President Hinckley looking forward to the future, a set of architectural drawings before him. In the background is a portrait of Brigham Young, making it appear that President Young looks over President Hinckley\u2019s shoulder.\nThe portrait of Brigham Young shown in this painting actually hangs in President Hinckley\u2019s office, and he has often spoken of it. In a recent general conference, he said:\n\u201cAt the close of one particularly difficult day, I looked up at a portrait of Brigham Young that hangs on my wall. I asked, \u2018Brother Brigham, what should we do?\u2019 I thought I saw him smile a little, and then he seemed to say: \u2018In my day, I had problems enough of my own. Don\u2019t ask me what to do. This is your watch. Ask the Lord, whose work this really is.\u2019\u201d8\nThese two great prophets, President Brigham Young and President Gordon B. Hinckley, are linked together in their shared prophetic vision that comes from seeing the future and having the faith to bring that vision into present reality.\nPresident Hinckley, like Brigham Young, is a pioneer and a builder. He has traveled the world, meeting kings, queens, and presidents. He has been interviewed by the world\u2019s media. He continues to bring the Church \u201cout of obscurity.\u201d9 More than 75 temples have been built in the last 12 years. And he had the inspiration to build the majestic Conference Center.\nPresident Hinckley, like Brigham Young, spreads the gospel and values education. Church membership now approaches 13 million in 176 nations, territories, and countries. More than 53,000 missionaries circle the globe. This conference is being translated into 90 languages. He continues to support Church universities and Church education. More than 26,000 members now enjoy the benefits of the Perpetual Education Fund.\nPresident Hinckley, like Brigham Young, loves the youth and all members of the Church. The youth of the Church especially reach out to President Hinckley for prophetic counsel.\nPresident Hinckley loves the Prophet Joseph Smith. Several years ago, he said:\n\u201cI worship the God of heaven who is my Eternal Father. I worship the Lord Jesus Christ who is my Savior and my Redeemer. I do not worship the Prophet Joseph Smith, but I reverence and love this great seer through whom the miracle of this gospel has been restored. I am now growing old, and I know that in the natural course of events before many years, I will step across the threshold to stand before my Maker and my Lord and give an accounting of my life. And I hope that I shall have the opportunity of embracing the Prophet Joseph Smith and of thanking him and of speaking of my love for him.\u201d10\nI bear my humble witness that both President Brigham Young and President Gordon B. Hinckley are prophets who have led the Church by inspiration and revelation. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nEarl C. Tingey\nProphets\u2014Pioneer and Modern Day\n2007\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brethren, it is a joy for me to be with you in this worldwide meeting of the priesthood of God. Tonight I will speak of priesthood preparation, both our own and that which we help provide for others.\nMost of us must wonder to ourselves at times, \u201cAm I prepared for this assignment in the priesthood?\u201d My answer is, \u201cYes, you have been prepared.\u201d My purpose today is to help you recognize that preparation and draw courage from it.\nAs you know, the Aaronic Priesthood is designated as a preparatory priesthood. The great majority of Aaronic Priesthood holders are young deacons, teachers, and priests between 12 and 19 years of age.\nWe may come to think of priesthood preparation as occurring in the Aaronic Priesthood years. But our Heavenly Father has been preparing us since we were taught at His knee in His kingdom before we were born. He is preparing us tonight. And He will continue to prepare us as long as we will let Him.\nThe purpose of all priesthood preparation, in the premortal life and in this life, is to fit us, and those we serve for Him, for eternal life. Some of the first lessons in the premortal life surely included the plan of salvation, with Jesus Christ and His Atonement at its center. We were not only taught the plan but were in councils where we chose it.\nBecause a veil of forgetfulness was placed over our minds at birth, we have had to find a way to relearn in this life what we once knew and defended. Part of our preparation in this life has been to find that precious truth so that we can then recommit to it by covenant. That has required faith, humility, and courage on our part as well as help from people who had found the truth and then shared it with us.\nIt may have been parents, missionaries, or friends. But that help was part of our preparation. Our priesthood preparation always includes others who have already been prepared to offer us the opportunity to accept the gospel and then choose to act by keeping covenants to get them down into our hearts. For us to qualify for eternal life, our service in this life must include working with all our heart, might, mind, and strength to prepare others to return to God with us.\nSo part of the priesthood preparation we will have in this life will be opportunities to serve and teach others. It may include being teachers in the Church, wise and loving fathers, members of a quorum, and missionaries for the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will offer the opportunities, but whether we are prepared will depend on us. My intent tonight is to point out some of the crucial choices necessary for priesthood preparation to succeed.\nGood choices both by the person training and the one being trained depend on some understanding of how the Lord prepares His priesthood servants.\nFirst, He calls people, young and old, who may appear to worldly eyes, and even to themselves, to be weak and simple. The Lord can turn those apparent shortcomings into strengths. That will change the way the wise leader chooses whom to train and how to train. And it can change how the priesthood holder responds to the development opportunities he is offered.\nLet\u2019s consider some examples. I was an inexperienced priest in a large ward. My bishop called me on the phone one Sunday afternoon. When I answered, he said, \u201cDo you have time to go with me? I need your help.\u201d He explained only that he wanted me to go as his companion to visit a woman I did not know, who was without food and who needed to learn how to manage her finances better.\nNow, I knew that he had two seasoned counselors in his bishopric. Both were mature men of great experience. One counselor was the owner of a large business, who later became a mission president and a General Authority. The other counselor was a prominent judge in the city.\nI was the bishop\u2019s newly called first assistant in the priests quorum. He knew that I understood little about welfare principles. I knew even less about financial management. I had not yet written a check; I had no bank account; I hadn\u2019t even seen a personal budget. Yet, despite my inexperience, I sensed that he was deadly serious when he said, \u201cI need your help.\u201d\nI have come to understand what that inspired bishop meant. He saw in me a golden opportunity to prepare a priesthood holder. I am sure that he did not foresee in that untrained boy a future member of the Presiding Bishopric. But he treated me that day, and all the days I knew him over the years, as a preparation project of great promise.\nHe seemed to enjoy it, but it was work for him. On our return to my home after we visited the widow in need, he parked the car. He opened his well-worn and heavily marked scriptures. And he gave me kindly correction. He told me that I needed to study the scriptures and learn more. But he must have seen that I was weak and simple enough to be teachable. To this day I remember what he taught that afternoon. But even more, I remember how confident he was that I could learn and be better\u2014and that I would.\nHe saw beyond the reality of who I was to the possibilities that lie inside someone who feels weak and simple enough to want the Lord\u2019s help and to believe that it will come.\nBishops, mission presidents, and fathers can choose to act on those possibilities. I saw it happen recently in a fast meeting as a deacons quorum president bore his testimony. He was about to become a teacher and leave his quorum members behind him.\nHe testified with great feeling in his voice of the growth in goodness and power in the members of his quorum. I\u2019ve never heard a person praise an organization more wonderfully than he did. He praised their service. And then he said that he knew that he had been able to help the new deacons when they felt overwhelmed because he had felt overwhelmed when he came into the priesthood.\nHis feelings of weakness had made him more patient, more sympathetic, and therefore better able to strengthen and serve others. In those two years in the Aaronic Priesthood, it seemed to me, he had become seasoned and wise. He had learned that he was helped as a quorum president by a clear and vivid memory of his own needs when he was two years younger. His challenge in the future in his leadership and ours will come when such memories fade and grow dim through time and our success.\nPaul must have seen that danger in counsel to his younger companion in the priesthood, Timothy. He encouraged and instructed him in his own priesthood preparation and in helping the Lord prepare others.\nListen to what Paul said to Timothy, his younger companion:\n\u201cLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\n\u201cTill I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.\n\u201cNeglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands. \u2026\n\u201cTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine;1 continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d2\nPaul gave good counsel for all of us. Don\u2019t worry about how inexperienced you are or think you are, but think about what, with the Lord\u2019s help, you can become.\nThe doctrine that Paul urges us to feast upon in our priesthood preparation is the words of Christ and so to qualify for the receipt of the Holy Ghost. Then we can know what the Lord would have us do in our service and receive the courage to do it, whatever difficulty we face in the future.\nWe are being prepared for priesthood service that will become more challenging with time. For instance, our muscles and our brains age as we do. Our capacity to learn and remember what we have read will diminish. To give the priesthood service the Lord expects of us will take more and more self-discipline every day of our lives. We can be prepared for that test by building faith through service as we go.\nThe Lord has given us the opportunity to prepare by something He has called \u201cthe oath and covenant [of] the priesthood.\u201d3\nIt is a covenant we make with God to keep all His commandments and give service as He would give it if He were personally present. Living up to that standard as best we can builds the strength we will need to endure to the end.\nGreat priesthood trainers have shown me how to build that strength: it is to form a habit of pushing on through the fatigue and fear that might make you think of quitting. The Lord\u2019s great mentors have shown me that spiritual staying power comes from working past the point when others would have taken a rest.\nYou great priesthood leaders who have built that spiritual strength in your youth still possess it when physical strength weakens.\nMy younger brother was in a small Utah city on business. He got a phone call at his hotel from President Spencer W. Kimball. It was late at night after what was a hard day of work for my brother and surely for President Kimball, who began the conversation this way. He said, \u201cI heard that you were in town. I know it\u2019s late and that you may be in bed, but could you help me? I need you as my companion to see the condition of all our chapels in this city.\u201d My brother went with him that night, lacking knowledge of chapel maintenance or anything about chapels and not knowing why President Kimball would be doing such a thing after his long day or why he needed any help.\nYears later I received a similar call late at night in a hotel in Japan. I was then the new commissioner of education for the Church. I knew that President Gordon B. Hinckley was staying somewhere in that same hotel on his separate assignment to Japan. I answered the ringing phone just after I had lain down on the bed to sleep, exhausted by having done all I thought I had the strength to do.\nPresident Hinckley asked in his pleasant voice, \u201cWhy are you sleeping when I am here reading a manuscript that we have been asked to review?\u201d So I got up and went to work, even though I knew that President Hinckley could give a better review of a manuscript than I could possibly do. But somehow he made me feel that he needed my help.\nPresident Thomas S. Monson, at the end of almost every meeting, asks the secretary to the First Presidency, \u201cAm I up to date on my work?\u201d And he always smiles when the answer comes back: \u201cOh, yes, President, you are.\u201d President Monson\u2019s pleased smile sends me a message. It makes me think, \u201cIs there something more I could do on my assignments?\u201d And then I go back to my office to work.\nGreat teachers have shown me how to prepare to keep the oath and covenant when time and age will make it harder. They have shown and taught me how to discipline myself to work harder than I thought I could while I still have health and strength.\nI can\u2019t be a perfect servant every hour, but I can try to give more effort than I thought I could. With that habit formed early on, I will be prepared for trials later. You and I can be prepared with the strength to keep our oath and covenant through the tests that will surely come as we approach the end of life.\nI saw evidence of that in a Church Board of Education meeting. President Spencer W. Kimball by then had given years of service while enduring a series of health challenges only Job would understand. He was chairing the meeting that morning.\nSuddenly, he stopped speaking. He slumped in his chair. His eyes closed. His head fell on his chest. I was seated near him. Elder Holland was next to us. The two of us rose to help him. Inexperienced as we were in emergencies, we decided to carry him, still seated in his chair, to his nearby office.\nHe became our teacher in that moment of his extremity. With one of us lifting each side of his chair, we went out of the meeting room into the hallway of the Church Administration Building. He half opened his eyes, still dazed, and said, \u201cOh, please be careful. Don\u2019t hurt your backs.\u201d As we got near his office door, he said, \u201cOh, I feel terrible that I interrupted the meeting.\u201d Minutes after we got him into his office, still not knowing what his problems were, he looked up at us and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you ought to go back to the meeting?\u201d\nWe left and hurried back, knowing that somehow our being there must matter to the Lord. President Kimball had since his childhood pushed himself beyond his limits of endurance to serve and to love the Lord. It was a habit so ingrained that it was there when he needed it. He was prepared. And so he was able to teach and show us how to be prepared to keep the oath and covenant: by steady preparation over the years, through all our strength in what might appear to be little tasks with small consequences.\nMy prayer is that we may keep our priesthood covenants to qualify ourselves for eternal life and those we are called to train. I promise you if you do all that you can, God will magnify your strength and your wisdom. He will season you. I promise you that those whom you train and set an example for will praise your name as I have this day the great trainers I have known.\nI testify that God the Father lives and loves you. He knows you. He and His resurrected and glorified Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to an inexperienced boy, Joseph Smith. They trusted him with the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel and of the true Church. They encouraged him when he needed it. They let him feel loving chastening when it would bring him down to lift him up. They prepared him and They are preparing us for the strength to keep working toward the celestial glory that is the aim and the reason of all priesthood service.\nI leave you my blessing that you will be able to recognize the glorious opportunities God has given you in calling and preparing you to His service and the service of others. In the name of our loving leader and teacher, Jesus Christ, amen.\nHenry B. Eyring\nPreparation in the Priesthood: \u201cI Need Your Help\u201d\n2011\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "When our oldest children were still small, we lived on a busy street here in Salt Lake City. My wife, Verla, and I were concerned about the danger that street presented to our children. We used every opportunity to reinforce the importance of staying away from the street. In addition, this was a time in our children\u2019s lives when they were learning about temples and eternal families. So our children\u2019s prayers regularly included this request: \u201cPlease help us to be married in the temple and stay out of the street.\u201d\nOne day after some of our neighbor\u2019s children had gone home after playing at our house, my wife received a call from their mother. One of her children had heard a prayer while he was visiting us and had offered this variation when he said his own prayer at home: \u201cPlease help us stay out of the temple and get married in the street.\u201d\nI trust that that particular prayer was not received exactly the way it was phrased, but I do have a strong testimony of the importance of prayer in shaping our lives.\nThe Savior puts great emphasis on prayer in the Book of Mormon. He repeatedly and personally prayed with and for the Nephites. And after He did this, He asked them to follow His example:\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.\n\u201cAnd as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.\u201d (3 Ne. 18:15\u201316; see also 3 Ne. 18:24; 3 Ne. 19:17\u201334; 3 Ne. 27:21.)\nIn fact, Christ specifically exhorts the Nephites at least ten times to \u201cpray unto the Father in [his] name.\u201d (3 Ne. 18:19; see also 3 Ne. 13:6\u20139; 3 Ne. 14:11; 3 Ne. 17:3; 3 Ne. 18:20\u201321, 23; 3 Ne. 20:31; 3 Ne. 21:27; 3 Ne. 27:2\u20137, 9, 28.)\nChrist taught that prayer is indispensable at each step of the perfection process, but especially at the very beginning. For example, He taught that one of the key reasons for the restoration of the gospel was so scattered Israel could pray to the Father in the name of Christ:\n\u201cYea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name.\u201d (3 Ne. 21:27; emphasis added.)\nFurthermore, He taught that we in the Church are to pray on behalf of those who are investigating the Church. (See 3 Ne. 18:23\u201330.) He encouraged those who had heard His words to ponder them and to pray to the Father in His name for increased understanding. (See 3 Ne. 17:3.) And, of course, He showed us that even perfected people, such as Himself, should pray constantly.\nAt each level of our progression toward becoming like our Heavenly Father, prayer is a necessary step. Once we have tasted of His goodness, Christ encourages us to pray often\u2014in secret, in our families, in our churches, and in our hearts, continually asking specifically for the things which we need\u2014telling us, \u201cAnd whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.\u201d (3 Ne. 18:20.)\nChrist taught the Nephites that prayer is more than just a means to receive our Father in Heaven\u2019s generosity; rather, prayer itself is an act of faith as well as an act of righteousness. Prayer is the defining act of the worshipper of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ. This is because the act of prayer itself can change and purify us, both individually and as a group. As our Bible Dictionary states, \u201cThe object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.\u201d (P. 753.)\nIn other words, prayers bring our desires and the desires of our Father into harmony, thus bringing us both the blessing we are seeking and also the blessing of greater unity with the Father. This practice is key to the collective and individual salvation of women and men.\nElder Hyrum M. Smith expressed this idea well when he wrote, \u201cThe prayer of faith is the secret of the strength of the Church.\u201d (Hyrum M. Smith and Janne M. Sjodahl, The Doctrine and Covenants Commentary, rev. ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 194.)\nI have seen this verified in my own life. While we were living in California, one of our sons was seriously injured in an automobile accident. His skull was badly fractured, and doctors gave us very little encouragement that he would survive. Three days after he was admitted to the hospital, he contracted meningitis, and his condition worsened. Our family doctor and neighbor came to our home and said, \u201cAll we can do now is pray.\u201d\nAnd pray we did. For several weeks our neighbors, friends, and business associates joined us in praying for our son and for our own strength. After almost a month, our son\u2019s condition finally stabilized and then improved, and we were blessed to see him eventually recovered and smiling again.\nI would not wish a similar experience on anyone, but that terrible, difficult period taught us the principle that President Thomas S. Monson has taught the Church. Said he, \u201cPrayer is the passport to spiritual power.\u201d (Ensign, Nov. 1990, p. 47.) During our son\u2019s illness, we saw and felt the spiritual power of prayer! Our ward had never prayed harder than it did then, and I don\u2019t think the members had ever been closer to each other. Our family was sustained by the collective faith and prayers of our friends. And even as our hearts were breaking in fear that we might lose our son, we felt closer to our Heavenly Father and more aware of our dependency on Him than at almost any other time in our lives.\nWhile the blessings we ask for and receive through prayer are undeniably magnificent, the greatest blessing and benefit is not the physical or spiritual blessings that may come as answers to our prayers but in the changes to our soul that come as we learn to be dependent on our Heavenly Father for strength.\nOne mother told the following experience that helps to explain this idea. She said, \u201cSometimes while we are eating, one of my children will get my attention and signal to me while his mouth is full of food. Grunting and waving, he will try to motion for me to do something for him. I know perfectly well that what he wants is for me to pour him a glass of milk, but I will wait until he uses words to ask me before I will do it. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t understand what he wants but that I feel it is important for him to learn how to communicate well.\u201d\nIn much the same way that parents tutor their children in communication and courtesy, I believe that our Heavenly Father teaches us to pray because the very act of praying will improve us. We worship our Father in Heaven as all-knowing and all-powerful. Surely, as our Creator, He knows our cares, our worries, our joys, our struggles without our informing Him. The reason our Heavenly Father asks us to pray cannot be that we are able to tell Him something He does not already know. Rather, the reason He asks us to pray is that the process of learning to communicate effectively with Him will shape and change our lives as much as we are changed by learning to communicate as children.\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley teaches it this way: \u201cThere is something in the very posture of kneeling that contradicts the attitudes described by Paul; \u2018proud \u2026 heady, highminded.\u2019 \u2026\n\u201cThere is something in the act of addressing Deity that offsets a tendency toward blasphemy and toward becoming lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\n\u201cThe inclination to be unholy, as Paul described it, to be unthankful, is erased as together family members thank the Lord for life and peace and all they have.\u201d (Ensign, Feb. 1991, p. 4.)\nAside from participating in the ordinances of the gospel, there is no other time in our lives when we can renew our spiritual life and improve our understanding of our place before Heavenly Father the way we can when we pray. As we humble ourselves to approach our God and thoughtfully consider His grace and great love for us, we will become a more holy and reverent people, more able to receive the blessings He will willingly pour out on us. Truly, the prayer of faith is the secret of the strength of the Church.\nI testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was the Prophet of the Restoration. Ezra Taft Benson is our prophet. The Book of Mormon\u2019s gold plates are a reality, as were the appearances of Moroni and many other angels who instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith in response to his prayers. The restoration of the priesthood is real and eternal. It is the binding force for such divine ordinances as baptisms and sealings as administered by the Church today. The First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDavid E. Sorensen\nPrayer\n1993\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brothers and sisters, each day is a day of decision. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught us that \u201cdecisions determine destiny.\u201d1 The wise use of your freedom to make your own decisions is crucial to your spiritual growth, now and for eternity. You are never too young to learn, never too old to change. Your yearnings to learn and change come from a divinely instilled striving for eternal progression.2 Each day brings opportunity for decisions for eternity.\nWe are eternal beings\u2014spirit children of heavenly parents. The Bible records that \u201cGod created man in his own image, \u2026 male and female created he them.\u201d3 Recently I heard a chorus of children sing the beloved song \u201cI Am a Child of God.\u201d4 I wondered, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard that song rendered more often by singing mothers or faithful fathers?\u201d Are we not all children of God? In truth, not one of us can ever stop being a child of God!\nAs children of God, we should love Him with all our heart and soul, even more than we love our earthly parents.5 We should love our neighbors as brothers and sisters. No other commandments are greater than these.6 And we should ever revere the worth of human life, through each of its many stages.\nScripture teaches that the body and the spirit are the soul of man.7 As a dual being, each of you can thank God for His priceless gifts of your body and your spirit.\nThe Human Body\nMy professional years as a medical doctor gave me a profound respect for the human body. Created by God as a gift to you, it is absolutely amazing! Think of your eyes that see, ears that hear, and fingers that feel all the wondrous things around you. Your brain lets you learn, think, and reason. Your heart pumps tirelessly day and night, almost without your awareness.8\nYour body protects itself. Pain comes as a warning that something is wrong and needs attention. Infectious illnesses strike from time to time, and when they do, antibodies are formed that increase your resistence to subsequent infection.\nYour body repairs itself. Cuts and bruises heal. Broken bones can become strong once again. I have cited but a tiny sample of the many amazing God-given qualities of your body.\nEven so, it seems that in every family, if not in every person, some physical conditions exist that require special care.9 A pattern for coping with such a challenge has been given by the Lord. He said, \u201cI give unto men weakness that they may be humble; \u2026 for if they humble themselves \u2026 and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.\u201d10\nStellar spirits are often housed in imperfect bodies.11 The gift of such a body can actually strengthen a family as parents and siblings willingly build their lives around that child born with special needs.\nThe aging process is also a gift from God, as is death. The eventual death of your mortal body is essential to God\u2019s great plan of happiness.12 Why? Because death will allow your spirit to return home to Him.13 From an eternal perspective, death is only premature for those who are not prepared to meet God.\nWith your body being such a vital part of God\u2019s eternal plan, it is little wonder that the Apostle Paul described it as a \u201ctemple of God.\u201d14 Each time you look in the mirror, see your body as your temple. That truth\u2014refreshed gratefully each day\u2014can positively influence your decisions about how you will care for your body and how you will use it. And those decisions will determine your destiny. How could this be? Because your body is the temple for your spirit. And how you use your body affects your spirit. Some of the decisions that will determine your eternal destiny include:\nHow will you choose to care for and use your body?\nWhat spiritual attributes will you choose to develop?\nThe Human Spirit\nYour spirit is an eternal entity. The Lord said to His prophet Abraham: \u201cThou wast chosen before thou wast born.\u201d15 The Lord said something similar about Jeremiah16 and many others.17 He even said it about you.18\nYour Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth.19 You were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others.\nYou developed some of these attributes premortally. Others you can develop here on earth20 as you persistently seek them.21\nA pivotal spiritual attribute is that of self-mastery\u2014the strength to place reason over appetite. Self-mastery builds a strong conscience. And your conscience determines your moral responses in difficult, tempting, and trying situations. Fasting helps your spirit to develop dominance over your physical appetites. Fasting also increases your access to heaven\u2019s help, as it intensifies your prayers. Why the need for self-mastery? God implanted strong appetites within us for nourishment and love, vital for the human family to be perpetuated.22 When we master our appetites within the bounds of God\u2019s laws, we can enjoy longer life, greater love, and consummate joy.23\nIt is not surprising, then, that most temptations to stray from God\u2019s plan of happiness come through the misuse of those essential, God-given appetites. Controlling our appetites is not always easy. Not one of us manages them perfectly.24 Mistakes happen. Errors are made. Sins are committed. What can we do then? We can learn from them. And we can truly repent.25\nWe can change our behavior. Our very desires can change. How? There is only one way. True change\u2014permanent change\u2014can come only through the healing, cleansing, and enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.26 He loves you\u2014each of you!27 He allows you to access His power as you keep His commandments, eagerly, earnestly, and exactly. It is that simple and certain. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of change!28\nA strong human spirit with control over appetites of the flesh is master over emotions and passions and not a slave to them. That kind of freedom is as vital to the spirit as oxygen is to the body! Freedom from self-slavery is true liberation!29\nWe are \u201cfree to choose liberty and eternal life \u2026 or to choose captivity and death.\u201d30 When we choose the loftier path toward liberty and eternal life, that path includes marriage.31 Latter-day Saints proclaim that \u201cmarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator\u2019s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.\u201d We also know that \u201cgender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.\u201d32\nMarriage between a man and a woman is fundamental to the Lord\u2019s doctrine and crucial to God\u2019s eternal plan. Marriage between a man and a woman is God\u2019s pattern for a fulness of life on earth and in heaven. God\u2019s marriage pattern cannot be abused, misunderstood, or misconstrued.33 Not if you want true joy. God\u2019s marriage pattern protects the sacred power of procreation and the joy of true marital intimacy.34 We know that Adam and Eve were married by God before they ever experienced the joy of uniting as husband and wife.35\nIn our day civil governments have a vested interest in protecting marriage because strong families constitute the best way of providing for the health, education, welfare, and prosperity of rising generations.36 But civil governments are heavily influenced by social trends and secular philosophies as they write, rewrite, and enforce laws. Regardless of what civil legislation may be enacted, the doctrine of the Lord regarding marriage and morality cannot be changed.37 Remember: sin, even if legalized by man, is still sin in the eyes of God!\nWhile we are to emulate our Savior\u2019s kindness and compassion, while we are to value the rights and feelings of all of God\u2019s children, we cannot change His doctrine. It is not ours to change. His doctrine is ours to study, understand, and uphold.\nThe Savior\u2019s way of life is good. His way includes chastity before marriage and total fidelity within marriage.38 The Lord\u2019s way is the only way for us to experience enduring happiness. His way brings sustained comfort to our souls and perennial peace to our homes. And best of all, His way leads us home to Him and our Heavenly Father, to eternal life and exaltation.39 This is the very essence of God\u2019s work and glory.40\nMy dear brothers and sisters, each day is a day of decision, and our decisions determine our destiny. One day each of us will stand before the Lord in judgment.41 We will each have a personal interview with Jesus Christ.42 We will account for decisions that we made about our bodies, our spiritual attributes, and how we honored God\u2019s pattern for marriage and family. That we may choose wisely each day\u2019s decisions for eternity is my earnest prayer in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson\nDecisions for Eternity\n2013\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Many of the examples used in the teachings of our Savior, Jesus Christ, were from everyday events which happened around him. In much the same way, modern-day prophets teach us by their daily example. The simple but powerful message is \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d\nMay I share with you some of the teaching moments and lessons I have learned from a modern-day prophet.\nWe can learn much from the courage shown by President Kimball as he has endured his many illnesses. He is a living testimony that, by overcoming pain and adversity, we can cleanse our souls and strengthen our faith and testimony in Jesus Christ. Indeed, in terms of the trials he has had to face, he is in many ways a modern-day Job.\nThe story of Job in the Old Testament relates three of the great tests we all should be prepared to face at some period in our lives. First, temporal setbacks. Job lost all he owned. Second, physical illness that will test our faith and testimony. And third, depression. Job said, \u201cWhy died I not from the womb?\u201d (Job 3:11.) \u201cMy soul is weary of my life.\u201d (Job 10:1.) But the great lesson of Job is that, \u201cin all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.\u201d (Job 1:22.) Too often when adversity strikes, we use it as a justification to commit sin and turn away from the teachings of Jesus Christ, the prophets who lead us, and our family and friends. Job maintained his testimony and was blessed for his unwavering faith that God lived and that he would dwell in God\u2019s presence.\nPresident Kimball, being a righteous man like Job, has endured many trials\u2014cancer of the throat, heart surgery, boils, cranial surgery, and numerous other afflictions. President Kimball\u2019s experiences serve as an example of how we should meet similar adversity and suffering in our lives.\nPresident Kimball has not sinned or charged God foolishly. He has kept his integrity and his testimony, and sung the praises of his Lord throughout his many physical trials. We have never heard him complain about his trials. On the contrary, his challenge has been, \u201cGive me this mountain\u201d to climb. (See Josh. 14:12.)\nThe courage and faith of President Kimball to overcome adversity are an example to all of us, to testify that we, too, can meet the challenges of life. Our aches and pains are but little hurts in comparison to his. After his throat operation, President Kimball had no voice. During a testimony meeting in the temple, President David O. McKay asked him to bear his testimony. He could not speak a word. He could only utter inaudible, breathy sounds. He wrote a note to President McKay afterwards and asked, \u201cWhy would you do that to me?\u201d The President answered, \u201cSpencer, you must get your voice back, for you still have a great mission to perform.\u201d (What a moving example of the love of one prophet for another.) President Kimball was obedient. He learned how to control air in his throat and to use the scar tissue that developed in his larynx and his remaining vocal cord. He regained his voice and carried on his great work. The accomplishment of President Kimball\u2019s prophetic mission will stand equal to any in this or any other dispensation.\nPresident Kimball\u2019s wife, Camilla, has devotedly and lovingly followed her husband every step of the way. I remember one night in Samoa when both President and Sister Kimball had temperatures of 104 degrees. Early the next morning they were the first ones on the bus. He conducted the meetings, and they fulfilled all their busy schedule throughout the day, not just enduring, but being gracious and considerate and thinking of the needs of everyone else around them.\nWhen President Kimball was called to the Council of the Twelve, he accepted his call with humble tears. He wondered if he was worthy of such a great calling. After he hung up the telephone, it was Camilla who assured him, \u201cYou can do it, Spencer. You can do it.\u201d Camilla is a perfect example of being one with her companion. When asked about her health, her reply was \u201cWhen he is well, I\u2019m well.\u201d\nPresident Kimball taught me a lesson during my call to become a General Authority. He asked if I would come to Salt Lake City to serve as a General Authority for the rest of my life. I was overcome with emotion. My reply: \u201cPresident Kimball, I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Then he said, \u201cI only want you to say yes.\u201d The lesson was clear; there is no need for an eloquent speech to express our commitment or our love and devotion when accepting a call from the prophet. He already knows these things.\nPresident Kimball always reaches out with love to touch the \u201cone.\u201d\nWe were preparing for an area conference briefing, and as I entered President Kimball\u2019s office, he was seated at a typewriter, his back toward the door. He finished typing and spun around in his chair to greet me. In one hand was a thirty-two-page letter from a young man who had read his bookThe Miracle of Forgiveness and, in the other, his personally typed reply to answer the special needs of a young man who wanted and needed his help to repent. The message was a clear one to me: No matter how busy you are, never forget those who need your help.\nHe bears his missionary testimony as a special witness without the fear of man. I have observed it. At the Copenhagen Denmark Area Conference held August 3\u20135, 1976, President Kimball went to see Thorvaldsen\u2019s beautiful sculpture The Christus, the resurrected Christ, which has been reproduced, as you know, for the visitors\u2019 centers in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and New Zealand. After a few spiritual moments admiring The Christus, President Kimball bore his testimony to the caretaker who stood nearby. As he turned to the statue of Peter and pointed to the large set of keys in Peter\u2019s right hand, he proclaimed: \u201cThe keys of priesthood authority which Peter held as President of the Church I now hold as President of the Church in this dispensation.\u201d Then he stated to the caretaker, \u201cYou work every day with Apostles in stone, but today you are in the presence of living Apostles.\u201d He then introduced President N. Eldon Tanner, Elder Thomas S. Monson, and Elder Boyd K. Packer. He presented the caretaker with a Book of Mormon in Danish, and bore his testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The caretaker was moved to tears in acknowledgment of the Spirit he felt in the presence of a prophet and Apostles. He acknowledged to me as we left the church, \u201cToday I have been in the presence of servants of God.\u201d\nPresident Kimball works with loving diligence with all of his heart, might, mind, and strength. He does not demand or expect those around him to work at his pace, but at their pace. He is a man of action, demonstrated by the simple sign on his desk that says, \u201cDo It.\u201d\nFor those who work with him, his example eliminates phrases such as \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d His example and love motivate those who follow his example to achieve higher goals and lengthen their stride toward perfection. He has that rare ability to encourage each of us to do better than our best and to keep striving until we exceed our goals.\nDuring the planning and preparation for the Mexico, Central and South America area conferences in February 1977, we were scheduled to hold meetings in La Paz, Bolivia, which is twelve thousand feet above sea level. Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson and Dr. Russell M. Nelson advised us that President Kimball should have four to six hours\u2019 rest to acclimate his heart and blood pressure to the high altitude. President Kimball is very tightly scheduled during area conferences, and this allows little time for rest. (In reality, the doctors accompanied the General Authorities so that we could keep up with President Kimball.)\nI talked with President Tanner and President Romney to seek their assistance in getting President Kimball to rest in La Paz before the start of the area conference. They only smiled and said, \u201cYou can try.\u201d\nDetailed plans were presented to the First Presidency for area conferences in Mexico, Central and South America. I saw President Kimball make two small red check marks next to La Paz, Bolivia, where there were two meetings that he was not scheduled to attend. \u201cWhat are these meetings? Why am I not attending?\u201d he asked. There was a pause; then I replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a rest period, President Kimball.\u201d And he remarked, \u201cAre you tired, Elder Hales?\u201d\nWe arrived in La Paz, and the first meeting was a cultural event. He would not rest. My head ached; it felt as though it would explode in adjusting to the altitude, and we breathed oxygen to attempt to speed up our being acclimated to the twelve-thousand-foot altitude; but President Kimball took no oxygen. He greeted, embraced, and shook hands with two thousand Saints.\nAfter the last meeting, he invited one thousand more of his beloved Lamanites, who had come down from the Altiplano, to come shake his hand. They came and embraced him and shook his hand vigorously. He wanted to show his love for the Lamanites.\nDr. Wilkinson was concerned with the President\u2019s vigorous activity at twelve thousand feet and approached him. He asked President Kimball if it would be possible for him to stop soon. President Kimball said, \u201cIf you knew what I knew, you wouldn\u2019t ask me that question.\u201d President Kimball is driven by the knowledge that we are preparing for the second coming of Jesus Christ. He knows that it is his responsibility, along with those who are chosen to work with him, to take the message to all nations in their own tongue and language.\nPresident Kimball told the General Authorities, \u201cI am not afraid of death. What I am afraid of is that I will meet the Savior and he will say, \u2018You could have done better.\u2019\u201d\nCan you feel the dedication and urgency of a prophet\u2019s voice to move the kingdom forward? \u201cAre you tired, Elder Hales?\u201d has a way of ringing in my ears when I rest for a moment. If we knew what President Kimball knows, then we, too, would work with all our heart, might, mind, and strength.\nWhen we tried to save his strength, he\u2019d say, \u201cI know you are trying to save me. But I don\u2019t want to be saved; I want to be exalted.\u201d He then would tell us that the Lord would sustain him as the prophet, and we should not slow the Church down because of him.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith was counseled:\n\u201cMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\u201cAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.\n\u201cThy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.\u201d (D&C 121:7\u20139.)\nIn testimony, I ask the Lord\u2019s blessing upon us that we might feel the urgency of this great work, to understand what drives our prophet. He is a missionary because he knows that all mankind must be taught by the Spirit and be baptized. Then, if we live worthily, we will attain eternal life, be exalted, and return to the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ to dwell with them throughout eternity.\nI bear you my testimony that a prophet leads this Church today by revelation. One time, in closing a general conference, President Kimball said, \u201cMy people say \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 and do not what I say.\u201d It is my prayer that we will say, \u201cLord, Lord,\u201d and do as our prophet and those who lead this Church today say, and follow their example, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRobert D. Hales\nExamples from the Life of a Prophet\n1981\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brothers and sisters, this morning I wish to speak to you of eternal truths\u2014those truths which will enrich our lives and see us safely home.\nEverywhere people are in a hurry. Jet-powered aircraft speed their precious human cargo across broad continents and vast oceans so that business meetings might be attended, obligations met, vacations enjoyed, or families visited. Roadways everywhere\u2014including freeways, thruways, and motorways\u2014carry millions of automobiles, occupied by more millions of people, in a seemingly endless stream and for a multitude of reasons as we rush about the business of each day.\nIn this fast-paced life, do we ever pause for moments of meditation\u2014even thoughts of timeless truths?\nWhen compared to eternal verities, most of the questions and concerns of daily living are really rather trivial. What should we have for dinner? What color should we paint the living room? Should we sign Johnny up for soccer? These questions and countless others like them lose their significance when times of crisis arise, when loved ones are hurt or injured, when sickness enters the house of good health, when life\u2019s candle dims and darkness threatens. Our thoughts become focused, and we are easily able to determine what is really important and what is merely trivial.\nI recently visited with a woman who has been battling a life-threatening disease for over two years. She indicated that prior to her illness, her days were filled with activities such as cleaning her house to perfection and filling it with beautiful furnishings. She visited her hairdresser twice a week and spent money and time each month adding to her wardrobe. Her grandchildren were invited to visit infrequently, for she was always concerned that what she considered her precious possessions might be broken or otherwise ruined by tiny and careless hands.\nAnd then she received the shocking news that her mortal life was in jeopardy and that she might have very limited time left here. She said that at the moment she heard the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, she knew immediately that she would spend whatever time she had remaining with her family and friends and with the gospel at the center of her life, for these represented what was most precious to her.\nSuch moments of clarity come to all of us at one time or another, although not always through so dramatic a circumstance. We see clearly what it is that really matters in our lives and how we should be living.\nSaid the Savior:\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\n\u201cBut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:\n\u201cFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d1\nIn our times of deepest reflection or greatest need, the soul of man reaches heavenward, seeking a divine response to life\u2019s greatest questions: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go after we leave this life?\nAnswers to these questions are not discovered within the covers of academia\u2019s textbooks or by checking the Internet. These questions transcend mortality. They embrace eternity.\nWhere did we come from? This query is inevitably thought, if not spoken, by every human being.\nThe Apostle Paul told the Athenians on Mars\u2019 Hill that \u201cwe are the offspring of God.\u201d2 Since we know that our physical bodies are the offspring of our mortal parents, we must probe for the meaning of Paul\u2019s statement. The Lord has declared that \u201cthe spirit and the body are the soul of man.\u201d3 Thus it is the spirit which is the offspring of God. The writer of Hebrews refers to Him as \u201cthe Father of spirits.\u201d4 The spirits of all men are literally His \u201cbegotten sons and daughters.\u201d5\nWe note that inspired poets have, for our contemplation of this subject, written moving messages and recorded transcendent thoughts. William Wordsworth penned the truth:\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\nThe soul that rises with us, our life\u2019s Star,\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar:\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\nFrom God, who is our home:\nHeaven lies about us in our infancy!6\nParents ponder their responsibility to teach, to inspire, and to provide guidance, direction, and example. And while parents ponder, children\u2014and particularly youth\u2014ask the penetrating question, why are we here? Usually it is spoken silently to the soul and phrased, why am I here?\nHow grateful we should be that a wise Creator fashioned an earth and placed us here, with a veil of forgetfulness of our previous existence so that we might experience a time of testing, an opportunity to prove ourselves in order to qualify for all that God has prepared for us to receive.\nClearly, one primary purpose of our existence upon the earth is to obtain a body of flesh and bones. We have also been given the gift of agency. In a thousand ways we are privileged to choose for ourselves. Here we learn from the hard taskmaster of experience. We discern between good and evil. We differentiate as to the bitter and the sweet. We discover that there are consequences attached to our actions.\nBy obedience to God\u2019s commandments, we can qualify for that \u201chouse\u201d spoken of by Jesus when He declared: \u201cIn my Father\u2019s house are many mansions. \u2026 I go to prepare a place for you \u2026 that where I am, there ye may be also.\u201d7\nAlthough we come into mortality \u201ctrailing clouds of glory,\u201d life moves relentlessly forward. Youth follows childhood, and maturity comes ever so imperceptibly. From experience we learn the need to reach heavenward for assistance as we make our way along life\u2019s pathway.\nGod, our Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, have marked the way to perfection. They beckon us to follow eternal verities and to become perfect, as They are perfect.8\nThe Apostle Paul likened life to a race. To the Hebrews he urged, \u201cLet us lay aside \u2026 the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.\u201d9\nIn our zeal, let us not overlook the sage counsel from Ecclesiastes: \u201cThe race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.\u201d10 Actually, the prize belongs to him or her who endures to the end.\nWhen I reflect on the race of life, I remember another type of race, even from childhood days. My friends and I would take pocketknives in hand and, from the soft wood of a willow tree, fashion small toy boats. With a triangular-shaped cotton sail in place, each would launch his crude craft in the race down the relatively turbulent waters of Utah\u2019s Provo River. We would run along the river\u2019s bank and watch the tiny vessels sometimes bobbing violently in the swift current and at other times sailing serenely as the water deepened.\nDuring a particular race we noted that one boat led all the rest toward the appointed finish line. Suddenly, the current carried it too close to a large whirlpool, and the boat heaved to its side and capsized. Around and around it was carried, unable to make its way back into the main current. At last it came to an uneasy rest amid the flotsam and jetsam that surrounded it, held fast by the tentacles of the grasping green moss.\nThe toy boats of childhood had no keel for stability, no rudder to provide direction, and no source of power. Inevitably, their destination was downstream\u2014the path of least resistance.\nUnlike toy boats, we have been provided divine attributes to guide our journey. We enter mortality not to float with the moving currents of life but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve.\nOur Heavenly Father did not launch us on our eternal voyage without providing the means whereby we could receive from Him guidance to ensure our safe return. I speak of prayer. I speak too of the whisperings from that still, small voice; and I do not overlook the holy scriptures, which contain the word of the Lord and the words of the prophets\u2014provided to us to help us successfully cross the finish line.\nAt some period in our mortal mission, there appears the faltering step, the wan smile, the pain of sickness\u2014even the fading of summer, the approach of autumn, the chill of winter, and the experience we call death.\nEvery thoughtful person has asked himself the question best phrased by Job of old: \u201cIf a man die, shall he live again?\u201d11 Try as we might to put the question out of our thoughts, it always returns. Death comes to all mankind. It comes to the aged as they walk on faltering feet. Its summons is heard by those who have scarcely reached midway in life\u2019s journey. At times it hushes the laughter of little children.\nBut what of an existence beyond death? Is death the end of all? Robert Blatchford, in his book God and My Neighbor, attacked with vigor accepted Christian beliefs such as God, Christ, prayer, and particularly immortality. He boldly asserted that death was the end of our existence and that no one could prove otherwise. Then a surprising thing happened. His wall of skepticism suddenly crumbled to dust. He was left exposed and undefended. Slowly he began to feel his way back to the faith he had ridiculed and abandoned. What had caused this profound change in his outlook? His wife died. With a broken heart he went into the room where lay all that was mortal of her. He looked again at the face he loved so well. Coming out, he said to a friend: \u201cIt is she, and yet it is not she. Everything is changed. Something that was there before is taken away. She is not the same. What can be gone if it be not the soul?\u201d\nLater he wrote: \u201cDeath is not what some people imagine. It is only like going into another room. In that other room we shall find \u2026 the dear women and men and the sweet children we have loved and lost.\u201d12\nMy brothers and sisters, we know that death is not the end. This truth has been taught by living prophets throughout the ages. It is also found in our holy scriptures. In the Book of Mormon we read specific and comforting words:\n\u201cNow, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection\u2014Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.\n\u201cAnd then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.\u201d13\nAfter the Savior was crucified and His body had lain in the tomb for three days, the spirit again entered. The stone was rolled away, and the resurrected Redeemer walked forth, clothed with an immortal body of flesh and bones.\nThe answer to Job\u2019s question, \u201cIf a man die, shall he live again?\u201d came when Mary and others approached the tomb and saw two men in shining garments who spoke to them: \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.\u201d14\nAs the result of Christ\u2019s victory over the grave, we shall all be resurrected. This is the redemption of the soul. Paul wrote: \u201cThere are \u2026 celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.\u201d15\nIt is the celestial glory which we seek. It is in the presence of God we desire to dwell. It is a forever family in which we want membership. Such blessings are earned through a lifetime of striving, seeking, repenting, and finally succeeding.\nWhere did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go after this life? No longer need these universal questions remain unanswered. From the very depths of my soul and in all humility, I testify that those things of which I have spoken are true.\nOur Heavenly Father rejoices for those who keep His commandments. He is concerned also for the lost child, the tardy teenager, the wayward youth, the delinquent parent. Tenderly the Master speaks to these and indeed to all: \u201cCome back. Come up. Come in. Come home. Come unto me.\u201d\nIn one week we will celebrate Easter. Our thoughts will turn to the Savior\u2019s life, His death, and His Resurrection. As His special witness, I testify to you that He lives and that He awaits our triumphant return. That such a return will be ours, I pray humbly in His holy name\u2014even Jesus Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer, amen.\nBy President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson\nThe Race of Life\n2012\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "The Choir has sung \u201cJesus, the Very Thought of Thee.\u201d1 In the Book of Mormon, Nephi, speaking messianically, prophesies:\n\u201cAnd the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.\u201d2\nThe great and exquisite suffering of the Savior was for us, to keep us from having to suffer as He suffered.3 However, suffering is a part of life, and few will escape its grasp. Since it is something that each of us has gone through, is going through, or will go through, there is scriptural suggestion that we can learn spiritual lessons if we can approach suffering, sorrow, or grief with a focus on Christ. Anciently Paul wrote that our suffering may give us an opportunity to know the Savior better. Paul wrote to the Romans:\n\u201cThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:\n\u201cAnd if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\u201d4\nNow, lest anyone go looking for hardship and suffering, that is not what is taught. Rather, it is the attitude with which we approach our hardships and trials that allows us to know the Savior better. Experience teaches us that suffering is one of life\u2019s experiences that will come without seeking it. If I may use a personal example:\nSome years ago when our first son was about a year old, I was the source of some seemingly unnecessary suffering. We were attending college, and one evening I had been playing with my boy on the floor. I left the room to study, and as I closed the door behind me he apparently reached for me, raising his hand up behind his head, and his finger went into the hinged side of the door. When I closed the door he suffered a rather severe injury to his finger.\nWe rushed him to the emergency room at the hospital, he was given a local anesthetic, and a doctor came in; he assured us that it could be repaired. Almost paradoxically, at that point the only thing my one-year-old wanted was to be held by his dad. As long as he could see me he resisted any efforts to bind him for the delicate surgery. When I left the room he calmed down, and the doctor was able to proceed.\nDuring the process I was anxious and would draw close to the open door and look around the corner to see how things were proceeding. Perhaps by some unseen sense, as I would peek noiselessly around the corner, which was located behind him and to the side, his head would come up and he would strain to see if I was there.\nOn one of those occasions, as I saw him with his arm pinned out from his side\u2014his head arched, searching for his father\u2014the thought came to my mind of another Son, His arms stretched out, nailed to a cross, searching for His Father, and to my mind came the words, \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d5 What was a very traumatic moment in my life suddenly became very sacred.\nThere is throughout the scriptures a line of men and women who always seemed to keep their focus on Christ\u2014people who, no matter what injury or injustice life dealt them, remained faithful and willing to endure. I speak of Abraham, dispossessed of the land of his inheritance and commanded to sacrifice Isaac; of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers, imprisoned for honoring virtue and chastity, and left to linger in jail because of a thoughtless servant; of Ruth, widowed young and left destitute, yet constant and loyal to her mother-in-law; of all three Nephis, both Almas, and of course the Prophet Joseph.\nParticularly notable to me is Nephi\u2019s endurance. Continually receiving the wrath of his brothers, he was bound for four days on the boat coming to the promised land. He could not move, and on the fourth day, when it appeared that they were about to be swallowed up by the ocean, the brothers, fearing that they might perish, \u201cloosed the bands which were upon [his] wrists, and behold they had swollen exceedingly; and also [his] ankles were much swollen, and great was the soreness thereof.\n\u201cNevertheless, [he] did look unto [his] God, and [he] did praise him all the day long; and [he] did not murmur.\u201d6\nRemember, though, that it was Nephi who recorded: \u201cThey scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it.\u201d7 Nephi understood.\nAlthough the purpose of the suffering is not always apparent at the time, the Prophet Joseph had a singularly spiritual experience as he lingered in Liberty Jail. The Lord comforted him:\n\u201cMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;\n\u201cAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.\u201d8\n\u201cKnow thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.\n\u201cThe Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?\u201d9\nAs we are called upon to endure suffering, sometimes inflicted upon us intentionally or negligently, we are put in a unique position\u2014if we choose, we may be allowed to have new awareness of the suffering of the Son of God. While Alma tells us that Christ suffered all that any of us will ever have to suffer that He might know how to succor us,10 the reverse may also be true: that our suffering may allow us insight into the depth and magnitude of His atoning sacrifice.\nAs I have pondered that event with my own son so many years ago, it has provided new insights and perhaps even deeper understanding of the magnitude and magnificence of the Atonement. I have a deeper appreciation of what a Father was willing to allow His Son to go through for me and for each of us. I had a new personal insight into the depth and breadth of the Atonement. I could not imagine that I would willingly have let my son suffer even in this small way; and our Father \u201cso loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.\u201d11\nAlthough we have never discussed it, my son, too, would have the op-portunity to appreciate the passage where the Savior explains, \u201cBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.\u201d12\nAlthough I would not suggest that anything here can approach the holy Atonement, the scar on my son\u2019s hand is continually before him, and he has the opportunity, if he chooses to take it, to use his scar as a reminder of scars in the palms of the Savior\u2014suffered for our sins. He has the opportunity to understand in his own way the love the Savior has for us in willingly being scarred, bruised, broken, and torn for us.\nAlthough suffering may provide insight, we must be careful not to compare but rather to appreciate. There will always be infinite differences between us and our Savior. His comment to Pilate, \u201cThou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee,\u201d13 reminds us again of the willing and voluntary nature of His sacrifice. We can never endure the depth, the exquisite nature, or the magnitude of His suffering, \u201cwhich suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit.\u201d14 But like Nephi, we can have a greater appreciation for that which He did, and we can feel His spirit succoring us, and we can know the Savior in a very real sense, \u201cand this is life eternal, that [we] might know\u201d Him.15\nI bear testimony that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that through His suffering and Atonement we can receive a remission of our sins and can gain eternal life. I bear witness of His gentle and loving kindness. He is the Only Begotten of the Father and in all things did the will of His Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nKeith R. Edwards\nThat They Might Know Thee\n2006\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "\nWilford G. Edling\nChurch Audit Committee Report\n1973\nFriday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brethren, it is a humbling experience to stand before you this evening and to realize that beyond the imposing audience in this, the Conference Center, many hundreds of thousands of priesthood bearers are similarly assembled throughout the world.\nWhile contemplating the responsibility to speak to you, I recalled a definition of priesthood authority declared by President Stephen L Richards. Said he: \u201cThe Priesthood is usually simply defined as \u2018the power of God delegated to man.\u2019 This definition, I think, is accurate. But for practical purposes I like to define the Priesthood in terms of service and I frequently call it \u2018the perfect plan of service.\u2019\u201d1\nWhether we hold the office of a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood or that of an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood, we are duty bound by the Lord\u2019s revelation found in the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 99 [D&C 107:99]: \u201cWherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.\u201d\nAs our youngest son, Clark, was approaching his 12th birthday, he and I were leaving the Church Administration Building when President Harold B. Lee approached and greeted us. I mentioned that Clark would soon be 12, whereupon President Lee turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat happens to you when you turn 12?\u201d\nThis was one of those times when a father prays that a son will be inspired to give a proper response. Clark, without hesitation, said to President Lee, \u201cI will be ordained a deacon!\u201d\nThe answer was the one President Lee had sought. He then counseled our son, \u201cRemember, it is a great blessing to hold the priesthood.\u201d\nWhen I was a boy, I looked forward to passing the sacrament to the ward members. We deacons were trained as to our duties. One of the men in our ward, Louis, suffered from palsy. His head and hands shook so violently that he could not, by himself, partake of the sacrament. Each deacon knew that his duty in serving Louis was to hold the bread to his lips so that he might partake and to similarly place the cup of water to his mouth with one hand, while steadying his head with the other, the tray being held by another deacon while doing so. Always Louis would say, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nIt was 40 years ago this conference time when President David O. McKay called me to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. At the first meeting of the Presidency and Twelve which I attended where the sacrament was served, President McKay announced, \u201cBefore we partake of the sacrament, I would like to ask our newest member of this body, Brother Monson, if he would instruct the First Presidency and Twelve on the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\u201d It was then that I gained a true understanding of the old adage: \u201cWhen the time for decision arrives, the time for preparation is past.\u201d It was also the time to remember the counsel found in 1 Peter: \u201cBe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.\u201d2\nI began my remarks by referring to a letter which I had received from one of the servicemen from our ward who was serving on the front lines in Korea during that sometimes forgotten war. The writer told how, amidst the shelling on Sunday morning, several in his platoon partook of the bread and then the water, both served from a helmet. Each remembered the significance of the blessing pronounced on the sacred emblems and his individual responsibility to keep the commandments of the Lord and to follow the Lord\u2019s example of service to others.\nThe memory of that particular experience with the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve has not dimmed in the intervening 40 years.\nTo those who have been absent from home and family, whether in the military, on missions, or for other purposes, the holiday season brings forth a yearning\u2014even a longing\u2014to be together with loved ones. To hear the laughter of children, to witness the expression of love by parents, and to feel the embrace of brothers and sisters provide a preview of heaven and the eternal joy to be found there.\nOne December evening, while waiting to board a plane en route to the United States, Sister Monson and I were standing in the stifling heat and humidity of Singapore, when over the airport loudspeaker system came a familiar, lilting melody, with Bing Crosby singing the words:\nI\u2019ll be home for Christmas;\nYou can plan on me.\nPlease have snow and mistletoe\nAnd presents on the tree.\nChristmas Eve will find me\nWhere the love-light gleams.\nI\u2019ll be home for Christmas\nIf only in my dreams.3\nThe First Presidency has long emphasized the statement, \u201cThe home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place nor fulfill its essential functions.\u201d4\nThere are those families comprised of mothers and fathers, sons and daughters who have, through thoughtless comment, isolated themselves from one another. An account of how such a tragedy was narrowly averted occurred many years ago in the life of a young man who, for purposes of privacy, I shall call Jack.\nThroughout Jack\u2019s life, he and his father had many serious arguments. One day, when he was 17, they had a particularly violent one. Jack said to his father, \u201cThis is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. I\u2019m leaving home, and I shall never return.\u201d So saying, he went to the house and packed his bag. His mother begged him to stay; he was too angry to listen. He left her crying at the doorway.\nLeaving the yard, he was about to pass through the gate when he heard his father call to him, \u201cJack, I know that a large share of the blame for your leaving rests with me. For this I am truly sorry. I want you to know that if you should ever wish to return home, you\u2019ll always be welcome. And I\u2019ll try to be a better father to you. I want you to know that I\u2019ll always love you.\u201d\nJack said nothing but went to the bus station and bought a ticket to a distant point. As he sat on the bus, watching the miles go by, he commenced to think about the words of his father. He began to realize how much love it had required for him to do what he had done. Dad had apologized. He had invited him back and left the words ringing in the summer air: \u201cI love you.\u201d\nIt was then that Jack realized that the next move was up to him. He knew the only way he could ever find peace with himself was to demonstrate to his father the same kind of maturity, goodness, and love that Dad had shown toward him. Jack got off the bus. He bought a return ticket and went back.\nHe arrived shortly after midnight, entered the house, turned on the light. There in the rocking chair sat his father, his head in his hands. As he looked up and saw Jack, he arose from the chair and they rushed into each other\u2019s arms. Jack often said, \u201cThose last years that I was home were among the happiest of my life.\u201d\nWe could say that here was a boy who overnight became a man. Here was a father who, suppressing passion and bridling pride, rescued his son before he became one of that vast, \u201clost battalion\u201d resulting from fractured families and shattered homes. Love was the binding band, the healing balm. Love so often felt, so seldom expressed.\nFrom Mount Sinai there thunders in our ears, \u201cHonour thy father and thy mother.\u201d5 And later from the Lord the injunction, \u201cLive together in love.\u201d6\nBrethren, ours is the responsibility, yes, even the solemn duty, to reach out to those who have slipped into inactivity or strayed from the family circle.\nRecall with me the beautiful words of the Lord\u2019s revelation from section 18 of the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. \u2026\n\u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\n\u201cAnd now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\u201d7\nAs presidencies of Aaronic Priesthood quorums, as advisers to these quorums, we can, with the Lord\u2019s help, reach out and rescue those for whom we have responsibility. Young men, with a smile on your face and determination in your heart, you can take, arm in arm, a less-active boy and together come to priesthood meeting and learn of the Lord and what He has prepared for you to do. You are entitled to His divine help, for He has promised you: \u201cI will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d8\nBrethren of the Melchizedek Priesthood, you have the same sacred charge and obligation as pertains to your duties to other men and to their families. And you have the same promise of the Lord to attend your efforts.\nAs you succeed, you will be answering a mother\u2019s prayer, the tender though unexpressed feelings of children\u2019s hearts; and your names will forever be honored by those whom you reach out and help.\nLet me share with you a rather private but joyful example from my own experience.\nAs a bishop, I worried about any members who were inactive, not attending, not serving. Such was my thought one day as I drove down the street where Ben and Emily Fullmer lived. Aches and pains of advancing years caused them to withdraw from activity to the shelter of their home\u2014isolated, detached, shut out from the mainstream of daily life and association. Ben and Emily had not been in our sacrament meeting for many years. Ben, a former bishop, would sit constantly in his front room reading and memorizing the New Testament.\nI was en route from my uptown sales office to our plant on Industrial Road. For some reason I had driven down First West, a street which I never had traveled before to reach the destination of our plant. Then I felt the unmistakable prompting to park my car and visit Ben and Emily, even though I was on my way to a meeting. I did not heed the impression at first but drove on for two more blocks; however, when the impression came again, I returned to their home.\nIt was a sunny weekday afternoon. I approached the door to their home and knocked. I heard the tiny fox terrier dog bark at my approach. Emily welcomed me in. Upon seeing me, she exclaimed, \u201cAll day long I have waited for my phone to ring. It has been silent. I hoped the postman would deliver a letter. He brought only bills. Bishop, how did you know today is my birthday?\u201d\nI answered, \u201cGod knows, Emily, for He loves you.\u201d\nIn the quiet of their living room, I said to Ben and Emily, \u201cI really don\u2019t know why I was directed here today, but I was. Our Heavenly Father knows. Let\u2019s kneel in prayer and ask Him why.\u201d This we did, and the answer came. As we arose from our knees, I said to Brother Fullmer, \u201cBen, would you come to priesthood meeting when we meet with all the priesthood and relate to our Aaronic Priesthood boys the story you once told me when I was a boy, how you and a group of boys were en route to the Jordan River to swim one Sunday, but you felt the Spirit direct you to attend Sunday School. And you did. One of the boys who failed to respond to that Spirit drowned that Sunday. Our boys would like to hear your testimony.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he responded.\nI then said to Sister Fullmer, \u201cEmily, I know you have a beautiful voice. My mother has told me so. Our ward conference is a few weeks away, and our choir will sing. Would you join the choir and attend our ward conference and perhaps sing a solo?\u201d\n\u201cWhat will the number be?\u201d she inquired.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019d like you to sing it.\u201d\nShe sang. He spoke to the Aaronic Priesthood. Hearts were gladdened by the return to activity of Ben and Emily. They rarely missed a sacrament meeting from that day forward. The language of the Spirit had been spoken. It had been heard. It had been understood. Hearts were touched and souls saved.

The sesquicentennial celebration of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley attracted attention all over the world. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio told our story. What a grand opportunity it was for the peoples of the world to learn more about who we are. Now we must determine whether we will just let it stand as a great media event or whether it will be an opportunity to better fulfill our charge to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.\nI am certain the Lord expects us to do the latter. When we were brought forth out of the waters of baptism and were confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we covenanted with the Lord that we would be part of bringing His gospel message to His children. I pondered this renewed opportunity which is ours and started to examine myself. How prepared am I to make a contribution to the kingdom?\nAs I reviewed my qualifications, my mind turned to the teachings early in my life in Primary when I was between 3 and 12 years of age. The Primary had a profound influence on my life and fortified the teachings of noble parents. Before I could move into the Aaronic Priesthood, join the Boy Scouts, or enter into senior Sunday School, I had to graduate from Primary. Two requirements were to memorize the names of the current Twelve Apostles and the 13 Articles of Faith. I had to stand beside my bishop in a sacrament meeting and answer a question directed from him to certify my completion of Primary graduation requirements. I knew the bishop would usually ask prospective Primary graduates to repeat one of the Articles of Faith. The bishop was my father, and you can rest assured he didn\u2019t let me off easy! Of course, he asked me to repeat the 13th article of faith, the longest, before he presented me with my Primary graduation certificate.\nAs I\u2019ve reflected on this experience, I\u2019ve quizzed myself, How well do I remember those two memorization requirements? I discovered I could still name the Twelve Apostles that existed at that time\u2014Rudger Clawson, Reed Smoot, George Albert Smith, George F. Richards, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Stephen L Richards, Richard R. Lyman, Melvin J. Ballard, John A. Widtsoe, Joseph F. Merrill, and Charles A. Callis. But after the first five articles of faith, I had trouble remembering their order and their full content. I needed a refresher course! I photocopied the Articles of Faith from the scriptures and taped them to the wall of my bathroom where I could see them each morning as I was brushing my teeth and shaving. Within a very few days, I again had them firmly in mind. This experience has brought a deep conviction to me that they were given by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I reached the conclusion that if I studied the content of each of the Articles of Faith, I could explain and defend every gospel principle I might have the opportunity to expound to someone searching for the restored truth.\nWhat a great blessing it would be if every member of the Church memorized the Articles of Faith and became knowledgeable about the principles contained in each. We would be better prepared to share the gospel with others.\nLet us review for a moment how the Articles of Faith came to be. The Prophet was often asked to explain the teachings and practices of Mormonism. \u201cJohn Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, asked Joseph Smith to provide him with a sketch of \u2018the rise, progress, persecution, and faith of the Latter-Day Saints.\u2019\u201d Mr. Wentworth, originally from New Hampshire, desired this information to help a friend compile a history of his native state. \u201cJoseph complied with this request and sent Wentworth a multi-page document containing an account of many of the early events in the history of the Restoration, including the First Vision and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. The document also contained thirteen statements outlining Latter-day Saint beliefs, which have come to be known as the Articles of Faith.\u201d The information sent to Wentworth was not published in the Chicago Democrat, but in the Church newspaper, Times and Seasons, published in March of 1842. \u201cIn 1851 the Articles of Faith were included in the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price published in the British Mission. After the Pearl of Great Price was revised in 1878 and canonized in 1880, the Articles of Faith became official doctrine of the Church\u201d (see Church History in the Fulness of Times [Church Educational System Manual, 1993], 256\u201357).\nPerhaps a brief review of the content of each of the 13 Articles of Faith will help in memorizing them to explain the basic doctrines of the Church.\nThe first article anchors our belief in God, our Eternal Father, in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. How grateful we are for a knowledge of Supreme Beings that rule and govern this world. Our belief does not come from the speculations of men about the existence and nature of God, but from firsthand experience from the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove. His experience clarified for mankind the existence of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Thus to the world came the vision that three personages comprise this great presiding council of the universe and have revealed themselves to mankind as three separate beings, physically distinct from each other as demonstrated by the accepted records of their divine dealings with mankind. We know the occasions where they have been in evidence to mankind as three distinct personages. It is clear that the Father is a personal being possessing a definite form of body, parts, and spiritual passions, that Jesus Christ was with the Father in spirit before coming to dwell in the flesh, and through whom worlds were made. He lived among men as a man, with all of the physical characteristics of a human being. After His Resurrection He appeared in that same form. The Holy Ghost, also called Spirit or Spirit of the Lord, Spirit of God, Comforter, or the Spirit of the Truth, is not tabernacled in a body of flesh and bones but is a personage of spirit. The Holy Ghost is a witness of the Father and of the Son declaring to man their attributes, bearing record of the other personages of the Godhead.\nThe second and third articles announce our belief in the Atonement of our Lord and Savior, that through Him all mankind will be blessed with immortality. They state that we have the responsibility for accepting Him as our Savior, and we will only be responsible for our \u201cown sins and not for Adam\u2019s transgression\u201d (A of F 1:2).\nThe fourth and fifth articles refer to our belief in the first principles of the gospel. They are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and repentance. We also learn that the first ordinances of the gospel are baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. These ordinances are bestowed by men \u201ccalled of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those\u201d who have the authority to administer them (A of F 1:5).\nWe believe that from the very beginning the Lord established a plan for His children on earth. He would, in times and seasons, have the priesthood on earth to bless mankind with the authority to perform the sacred ordinances that would prove man\u2019s obedience to His will. There were tests to be conducted as we progressed in each step towards achieving God\u2019s greatest gift, the gift of life eternal. Fundamental, then, is having faith in His plan, in His law, to be clean and holy and to repent of our sins, and to partake of the sacred ordinance of baptism required for admission into His celestial kingdom. And after baptism to be given the great gift, that Comforter, to abide with us, to lead and guide and direct us as we progress through mortality\u2014all of these done under the authority given to mankind from God. Each man who officiates can trace that authority directly back to the Lord Himself, who bestowed that right on mankind.\nBuilding on the foundation established in the first five articles of faith, the sixth article tells us that an organization is necessary, and the same organization that existed in the primitive Church has been restored. The restored Church exists on the earth today, with the sacred power received through the restoration of the holy priesthood.\nThe seventh and ninth articles profess that the heavens are not closed, that God continues to reveal His will to mankind; as He has in the past, He does now in the present, and He will in the future. Spiritual gifts are received by mankind today, just as they were in days past.\nThe eighth article states our belief in the Bible as the \u201cword of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\u201d The Book of Mormon gives to us that second witness of the authenticity of the scriptures as recorded in the Bible. The Lord, in His divine plan for the restoration of the gospel in the latter days, brought forth the Book of Mormon as that additional witness to the mission of our Lord and Savior. It also provides a religious history that is profoundly important to our Father in Heaven\u2019s children.\nArticle 10 tells of our belief \u201cin the literal gathering of Israel,\u201d that Zion will be built again and Christ will return and \u201creign personally upon the earth.\u201d It was in June of 1830 that Samuel Smith, the brother of the Prophet, embarked on the first missionary journey to proclaim the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Thus began the gathering of Zion. The word went forth from Mount Zion to the peoples of the earth that the gospel had been restored. Today the work of uniting our Father in Heaven\u2019s children continues as we prepare for His ultimate return, for His millennial reign over the earth. We are anxiously and personally engaged in that great literal gathering when we profess His everlasting gospel to our friends, our neighbors, and the other peoples of the earth.\nThe 11th and 12th articles profess our belief in religious liberty, tolerance, and agency. Agency is one of the great gifts of God to His children. It allows all men and women the right to choose for themselves and to earn their own individual salvation. Also declared is our belief in secular governments and \u201cin obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law\u201d of the land (A of F 1:12).\nThe 13th article provides a special insight into how we should conduct our lives and present ourselves before the peoples of the earth. It reads: \u201cWe believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u2014We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\u201d\nThe Articles of Faith were not the work of a team of scholars but were authored by a single, inspired man who declared comprehensively and concisely the essential doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They contain direct and simple statements of the principles of our religion, and they constitute strong evidence of the divine inspiration that rested upon the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nI encourage each of you to study the Articles of Faith and the doctrines they teach. They are \u201cone of the most important statements of inspiration, history, and doctrine for the Church. \u2026 Each article is a positive statement [explaining] the differences between Mormonism and the [beliefs of other peoples of the world]\u201d (Church History in the Fulness of Times, 257). If you will use them as a guide to direct your studies of the Savior\u2019s doctrine, you will find yourselves prepared to declare your witness of the restored, true church of the Lord. You will be able to declare with conviction: \u201cWe believe these things.\u201d\nI add my testimony to the truthfulness of these special revealed truths in the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.\nL. Tom Perry\nThe Articles of Faith\n1998\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "A ribbon of black asphalt wends its way through the mountains of northern Utah into the valley of the Great Salt Lake, then meanders southward on its appointed course. Interstate 15 is its official name. This super freeway carries the output of factories, the products of commerce, and masses of humanity toward appointed destinations.\nSeveral days ago, while driving to my home, I approached the entrance to Interstate 15. At the on-ramp I noticed three hitchhikers, each one of whom carried a homemade sign which announced his desired destination. One sign read \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d while a second carried the designation \u201cBoise.\u201d However, it was the third sign which not only caught my attention but caused me to reflect and ponder its message. The hitchhiker had lettered not Los Angeles, California, nor Boise, Idaho, on the cardboard sign which he held aloft. Rather, his sign consisted of but one word and read simply \u201cANYWHERE.\u201d\nHere was one who was content to travel in any direction, according to the whim of the driver who stopped to give him a free ride. What an enormous price to pay for such a ride. No plan. No objective. No goal. The road to anywhere is the road to nowhere, and the road to nowhere leads to dreams sacrificed, opportunities squandered, and a life unfulfilled.\nUnlike the youthful hitchhiker, you and I have the God-given gift to choose the direction we go. Indeed, the apostle Paul likened life to a race with a clearly defined goal. To the saints at Corinth he urged: \u201cKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.\u201d (1 Cor. 9:24.) In our zeal, let us not overlook the sage counsel from Ecclesiastes: \u201cThe race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.\u201d (Eccl. 9:11.) Actually, the prize belongs to him who endures to the end.\nEach must ask himself the questions: \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d \u201cHow do I intend to get there?\u201d \u201cReally, what is my divine destiny?\u201d\nWhen I reflect on the race of life, I remember another race, even from childhood days. Perhaps a shared experience from this period will assist in formulating answers to these significant and universally asked questions.\nWhen I was about ten, my boyfriends and I would take pocketknives in hand and from the soft wood of a willow tree fashion small toy boats. With a triangular-shaped cotton sail in place, each would launch his crude craft in a race down the relatively turbulent waters of the Provo River. We would run along the river\u2019s bank and watch the tiny vessels sometimes bobbing violently in the swift current and at other times sailing serenely as the water deepened.\nDuring such a race, we noted that one boat led all the rest toward the appointed finish line. Suddenly, the current carried it too close to a large whirlpool, and the boat heaved to its side and capsized. Around and around it was carried, unable to make its way back into the main current. At last it came to rest at the end of the pool, amid the flotsam and jetsam which surrounded it, held fast by the fingerlike tentacles of the grasping green moss.\nThe toy boats of childhood had no keel for stability, no rudder to provide direction, and no source of power. Like the hitchhiker, their destination was \u201cANYWHERE,\u201d but inevitably downstream.\nWe have been provided divine attributes to guide our destiny. We entered mortality not to float with the moving currents of life, but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve.\nOur Heavenly Father did not launch us on our eternal journey without providing the means whereby we could receive from Him God-given guidance to ensure our safe return at the end of life\u2019s great race. Yes, I speak of prayer. I speak, too, of the whisperings from that still, small voice within each of us; and I do not overlook the holy scriptures, written by mariners who successfully sailed the seas we too must cross.\nIndividual effort will be required of us. What can we do to prepare? How can we assure a safe voyage?\nFirst, we must visualize our objective. What is our purpose? The Prophet Joseph Smith counseled: \u201cHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.\u201d (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp. 255\u201356.) In this one sentence we are provided not only a well-defined goal, but also the way we might achieve it.\nSecond, we must make continuous effort. Have you noticed that many of the most cherished of God\u2019s dealings with His children have been when they were engaged in a proper activity? The visit of the Master to His disciples on the way to Emmaus, the good Samaritan on the road to Jericho, even Nephi on his return to Jerusalem, and Father Lehi en route to the precious land of promise. Let us not overlook Joseph Smith on the way to Carthage, and Brigham Young on the vast plains to the valley home of the Saints.\nThird, we must not detour from our determined course. In our journey we will encounter forks and turnings in the road. There will be the inevitable trials of our faith and the temptations of our times. We simply cannot afford the luxury of a detour, for certain detours lead to destruction and spiritual death. Let us avoid the moral quicksands that threaten on every side, the whirlpools of sin, and the crosscurrents of uninspired philosophies. That clever pied piper called Lucifer still plays his lilting melody and attracts the unsuspecting away from the safety of their chosen pathway, away from the counsel of loving parents, away from the security of God\u2019s teachings. His tune is ever so old, his words ever so sweet. His prize is everlasting. He seeks not the refuse of humanity but the very elect of God. King David listened, then followed, then fell. But then so did Cain in an earlier era, and Judas Iscariot in a later one.\nFourth, to gain the prize we must be willing to pay the price. The apprentice does not become the master craftsman until he has qualified. The lawyer does not practice until he has passed the bar. The doctor does not attend our needs until internship has been completed.\nYou are the fellow that has to decide\nWhether you\u2019ll do it or toss it aside. \u2026 \nWhether you\u2019ll try for the goal that\u2019s afar\nOr just be contented to stay where you are.\nLet us remember how Saul the persecutor became Paul the proselyter, how Simon, the fisherman, became Peter, the apostle of spiritual power. And let us be mindful that before Easter there had to be a cross.\nOur example in the race of life could well be our elder brother, even the Lord. As a small boy, he provided a watchword: \u201cWist ye not that I must be about my Father\u2019s business?\u201d (Luke 2:49.) As a grown man he taught by example compassion, love, obedience, sacrifice, and devotion. To you and to me his summons is still the same: \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d\nOne who listened and who followed was the Mormon missionary Randall Ellsworth, about whom you may have read in your daily newspaper or watched on the television set in your home.\nSix months ago, while serving in Guatemala as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Randall Ellsworth survived the devastating earthquake which hurled a beam down on his back, paralyzed his legs, and severely damaged his kidneys.\nAfter receiving emergency medical treatment, Randall was flown to a large hospital near his home in Rockville, Maryland. While confined there, a television newscaster conducted with Randall an interview which I witnessed through the miracle of television. The reporter asked, \u201cCan you walk?\u201d The answer, \u201cNot yet, but I will.\u201d \u201cDo you think you will be able to complete your mission?\u201d Came the reply, \u201cOthers think not, but I will.\u201d\nWith microphone in hand, the reporter continued: \u201cI understand you have received a special letter containing a get-well message from none other than the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Randall, \u201cI am very grateful to President Ford for his thoughtfulness; but I received another letter, not from the president of my country, but from the president of my church\u2014The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014even President Spencer W. Kimball. This I cherish. With him praying for me, and the prayers of my family, my friends, and my missionary companions, I will return to Guatemala. The Lord wanted me to preach the gospel there for two years, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d\nI turned to my wife and commented, \u201cHe surely must not know the extent of his injuries. Our official medical reports would not permit us to expect such a return to Guatemala.\u201d\nHow grateful am I that the day of faith and the age of miracles are not past history but continue with us even now.\nThe newspapers and the television cameras directed their attention to more immediate news as the days turned to weeks and the weeks to months. The words of Rudyard Kipling described Randall Ellsworth\u2019s situation:\nThe tumult and the shouting dies;\n The Captains and the Kings depart:\nStill stands Thine ancient sacrifice,\n An humble and a contrite heart.\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\n Lest we forget\u2014lest we forget!\nAnd God did not forget him who possessed an humble and a contrite heart, even Elder Randall Ellsworth. Little by little the feeling in his legs began to return. In his own words, Randall described the recovery: \u201cThe thing I did was always to keep busy, always pushing myself. In the hospital I asked to do therapy twice a day instead of just once. I wanted to walk again on my own.\u201d\nWhen the Missionary Committee evaluated the amazing medical progress Randall Ellsworth had made, word was sent to him that his return to Guatemala was authorized. Said he, \u201cAt first I was so happy I didn\u2019t know what to do. Then I went into my bedroom and I started to cry. Then I dropped to my knees and thanked my Heavenly Father.\u201d\nTwo months ago Randall Ellsworth walked aboard the plane that carried him back to the mission to which he was called and back to the people whom he loved. Behind he left a trail of skeptics, a host of doubters, but also hundreds amazed at the power of God, the miracle of faith, and the reward of determination. Ahead lay honest, God-fearing, and earnestly seeking sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. They shall hear His word. They shall learn His truth. They shall accept His ordinances. A modern-day Paul, who too overcame his \u201cthorn in the flesh,\u201d has returned to teach them the truth, to lead them to life eternal.\nLike Randall Ellsworth, may each of us know where he is going, be willing to make the continuous effort required to get there, avoid any detour, and be ready to pay the often very high price of faith and determination to win life\u2019s race. Then, as mortality ends, we shall hear the plaudit from our Eternal Judge, \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\u201d (Matt. 25:21.)\nEach will then have completed his journey, not to a nebulous \u201cANYWHERE,\u201d but to his heavenly home\u2014even eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.\nMay such be our goal and our reward is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nWhich Road Will You Travel?\n1976\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "1 Behold, thus saith the Lord, even aAlpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was bcrucified for the sins of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094/n2 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you./n3 And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly ahumble before me and contrite./n4 And as the covenant which they made unto me has been abroken, even so it has become bvoid and of none effect./n5 And wo to him by whom this aoffense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea./n6 But blessed are they who have kept the acovenant and observed the bcommandment, for they shall obtain cmercy./n7 Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you./n8 And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of aMissouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites./n9 And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a aliving like unto men, until I prepare a place for you./n10 And again, be apatient in tribulation until I bcome; and, behold, I come quickly, and my creward is with me, and they who have dsought me early shall find erest to their souls.

In the story of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere gives this advice to Lancelot, the bravest of the Knights of the Round Table: \u201cFor I would not have you declare yourself to the world until you have proved your worthiness. Wherefore do not yourself proclaim your name, but wait until the world proclaimeth it.\u201d\nHow much more effective it is in our day also to let the world see our good works rather than hear us dwell on our own accomplishments or point out impressive achievements.\nWe should remember to avoid the damaging effects that can come when we appear to be boasting about increased numbers or growth. How much better it is to let others measure our achievements rather than misunderstand as we recite on a continuing basis our percentages, progress, or family performances.\nBoasting is to glorify oneself, to talk in a vain or bragging manner, or to talk especially about one\u2019s deeds. Boasting is to speak with pride and to take pride in, to brag about, to be proud to possess.\nOftentimes, boastful people are starving for attention. Boastful people may not be aware of the consequences caused by their method of presentation.\nAmmon gives us excellent guidelines for putting our success in proper perspective.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.\n\u201cBut Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.\n\u201cYea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.\u201d (Alma 26:10\u201312.)\nIn our conversations and conduct we can be much more effective if we avoid the demeaning effect of that which could be classified as boasting. We should wisely let others become aware of accomplishments by observations rather than to have us appear to flaunt them before the world. Boasting diminishes credibility and too often alienates friends, co-workers, family members, and even those who may observe us from a distance.\nWe are humbly grateful for the increased number of conversions, for the many missionaries in the field, and for the evidence of improved commitments to and in the Church.\nWe recall the response of one of our prophets, Spencer W. Kimball, years ago when he was told of the great numbers of missionaries serving in the field. He said, \u201cI am thankful, but not impressed.\u201d Gratitude was expressed, but he urged Church members to refrain from basking in their glory and to move on to higher levels and new horizons.\nOur Savior, Jesus Christ, to whose Church we belong, would be disappointed if we ever created the impression that the efforts and the hard work put forth to build his kingdom were based only on the wisdom and power of man.\nRecently during a special women\u2019s conference, a speaker told about how he\u2019d been quite successful in land development and how everything he\u2019d touched had turned to gold. He\u2019d also tried to live a faithful life and had been a very active servant in the gospel. Then he\u2019d been called as a mission president. He had apparently been a very effective mission president and had subsequently returned to his home state. Throughout his life he\u2019d experienced one success after another\u2014he was a recognized leader in his community, had built a prosperous business. Being called as a mission president had sort of cemented in his mind that he\u2019d \u201cmade it\u201d\u2014that he was an all-around success.\nWhen he returned from his mission, a combination of changing interest rates and other business factors caused his once-prosperous business to plummet. In fact, he\u2019d lost nearly everything. Telling the story, this man said, \u201cI realized that I\u2019d become quite boastful\u2014that while I felt I had a testimony of Jesus Christ, in my mind I had brought about all of these wonderful things through my hard work, intelligence, and so forth. But when hard times hit, I began to realize how offensive I must have been to others and to my Heavenly Father to assume that I had brought all of these good things on my own. I felt like I\u2019d lived a life of arrogance and boasting.\u201d\nHelaman\u2019s advice to his sons, Nephi and Lehi, can give us strength today:\n\u201cTherefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good. \u2026\n\u201cAnd now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal.\u201d (Hel. 5:7\u20138.)\nHelaman wanted his sons to do good for the right reasons\u2014not to boast, but to lay up treasures in heaven.\n\u201cLet not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth\u201d is counsel often stated. (Matt. 6:3.) This is especially true when we have had the opportunity to comfort, console, or counsel any fellowmen who are confused, troubled, or weary. Whatever success we might have had as we have tried to help should usually not be discussed, let alone boasted about. Humble, quiet, compassionate service is so soul-rewarding; who would need to point out the subject or location of kindly deeds?\n\u201cFor although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.\u201d (D&C 3:4.)\nHow easy it is for man to believe that temporal success has been achieved by his own skills and labor. Everything good comes from the Lord.\nConsideration for the feelings of others should always be important to worthy Latter-day Saints. Rightfully we may be happy about the number of children with which we have been blessed, the missionaries who have served, the temple marriages of our offspring, and the accomplishments of family members; but others who are not so fortunate may have feelings of guilt or inadequacy. They may have been praying long and hard for the same blessings about which we are boasting. These people may feel that they are out of favor with God.\nFor this reason our appreciation should be sincerely felt and gratitude expressed frequently to our Father in Heaven\u2014but not too vocally to the world.\nMay we all be gratefully aware of the source of our blessings and strengths and refrain from taking undue credit for personal accomplishments.\nOftentimes when we dwell on where we have been and where we are now, and what we have now spiritually or financially, we can create resentment rather than respect.\nBoasting, whether it be done innocently or otherwise, is not good. Too frequently it creates an impression of more interest in self than in others.\nIt has been my experience over the years as a participant in team athletics that the star performer who boasts of his achievements and records asks for trouble. Those who have records that continue to impress are those who point out and who truly acknowledge the strengths of teammates, coaches, managers, and thank God himself for extra talents and abilities.\nOpponents in athletic competitions seem to lie in wait to clobber those who boast in their own strength. Unusual satisfaction must have been David\u2019s when he was able to slay Goliath, a boastful, defiant giant.\nIt pleases God to have us humbly recognize his powers and his influence in our accomplishments rather than to indicate by words or innuendo that we have been responsible for remarkable achievements.\nWe learn from James 3:5 that often \u201cthe tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.\u201d No thinking Latter-day Saint will permit his comments, attitudes, or expressions to be construed as boasting in his own strength. Those who persist in boasting fail to recognize the true sources of personal achievement.\nHistory teaches us that those who boast in their own strength cannot have lasting success. Constantly we should be reminded that we must not boast of faith nor of mighty works, but instead should boast of God in his blessings and goodness to us. God will help us to understand that humility must be our foundation if the goodness of the Lord is to continue to come to and from us. The boasting man will certainly fall, because in his own strength no man endures. The boasting or conceited person in life is not expected by his peers to achieve great heights because he conveys an attitude he is already there.\nOne of the most common of all sins among worldly people is relying on and then boasting in the arm of flesh. This is a most serious evil. It is a sin born of pride, a sin that creates a frame of mind which keeps men from turning to the Lord and accepting his saving grace. When a man knowingly or unknowingly engages in self-exultation because of his riches, his political power, his worldly learning, his physical prowess, his business ability, or even his works of righteousness, he is not in tune with the Spirit of the Lord.\nWe would all do well to take a lesson from the Savior, who repeatedly acknowledged and gave credit to the Father in all things. Indeed, that precedent was set in the premortal council when Jesus Christ pledged the fruits of all he might himself accomplish to go to the Father: \u201cAnd the glory be thine forever.\u201d (Moses 4:2.)\nDuring his mortal ministry, Jesus raised Jairus\u2019s daughter to life. \u201cAnd her parents were astonished,\u201d Luke says, as well they should have been, \u201cbut he charged them that they should tell no man.\u201d (Luke 8:56.) Mark\u2019s account says, \u201che charged them straitly that no man should know it.\u201d (Mark 5:43.)\nThis wondrous deed that turned death into life, that bore record of the divinity of the One who even now was forecasting his own future victory over the grave, that could be performed only in righteousness and only by the power of God\u2014this mighty miracle should, as Matthew says, send His fame into all the land on its own merits. (See Matt. 4:24.)\nIndeed, the parents could not enshroud in secrecy that which was already public knowledge; everyone in the whole area would soon know, because of the way Jesus himself had handled the successive events, that the little maid who once was dead now lived. Her death had been announced openly to the multitude. Jesus himself had replied before the multitude that, notwithstanding her death, she would \u201cbe made whole.\u201d (Luke 8:50.) All the people would soon know that she now lived and could only be expected to wonder how and by what means life had come to her again.\nThe parents were charged to tell no man, but instead left the telling of this wondrous event to outsiders who were aware of the miracle. We as a matter of standard gospel counsel encourage that those who enjoy the gifts of the Spirit and who possess the signs which always follow those who believe are commanded not to boast of these spiritual blessings. In our day, after naming the miraculous signs that always attend those who have faith and those who believe the very truth taught by Jesus anciently, the Lord has said:\n\u201cBut a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation.\u201d (D&C 84:73.)\nPerhaps the charge to \u201ctell no man\u201d meant they were not to tell the account in a boastful way, lest a spirit of pride\u2014a spirit of self-adopted superiority\u2014should come into their souls. There were times when Jesus told the recipients of his healing power to go forth and testify of the goodness of God unto them, and other times when he limited the extent and detail of their witness.\nThe many admonitions in the scriptures to avoid boasting send the message that we should realize the source of all our blessings.\nEverything is given by God. All talent, creativity, ability, insight, and strength comes from him. In our own strength we can do nothing, as Ammon admitted to his brother. (See Alma 26:10\u201312.) When we seek the praise of man more than the praise of God, it will become easy to fall.\nBoasting will be erased when we seek the Lord\u2019s help and thank him for all we have and are.\nGod help us to humbly accept his blessings of strength and guidance. The wise and committed will praise his name forever and will avoid the very appearance of any attitudes or situations that feature personal accomplishments or boastings.\nI leave you my special witness of the truthfulness of this great work. All of us can more effectively share our knowledge and testimonies if we boast not. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nMarvin J. Ashton\n\u201cNeither Boast of Faith Nor of Mighty Works\u201d\n1990\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "My dear brothers and sisters, because it was not appropriate for me to commence my Church service until I had concluded my judicial duties in state government, I did not speak at the April conference where I was sustained. Consequently, this semiannual conference is my first opportunity to speak to the general membership of the Church, to express acceptance of my calling to the Council of the Twelve.\nI am thrilled with this calling. Having been \u201ccalled of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority\u201d (A of F 1:5), I have gladly forsaken my professional activities to spend the rest of my days in the service of the Lord. I will devote my whole heart, might, mind, and strength to the great trusts placed in me, especially to the responsibilities of a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world.\nMany men and women were called to Church service last April. Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.\nAs I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?\nService is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, \u201cWhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.\u201d (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: \u201cVerily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (Matt. 25:40.)\nIn latter-day revelation the Lord has commanded that we \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d (D&C 81:5.) In another section of the Doctrine and Covenants, he instructed us to be \u201canxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.\u201d (D&C 58:27.) Holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood receive it upon a covenant to use its powers in the service of others. Indeed, service is a covenant obligation of all members of the Church of Jesus Christ.\nWhether our service is to our fellowmen or to God, it is the same. (See Mosiah 2:17.) If we love him, we should keep his commandments and feed his sheep. (See John 21:16\u201317.)\nWhen we think of service, we usually think of the acts of our hands. But the scriptures teach that the Lord looks to our thoughts as well as to our acts. One of God\u2019s earliest commandments to Israel was that they should love him and \u201cserve him with all your heart and with all your soul.\u201d (Deut. 11:13.) When the prophet Samuel was sent to Bethlehem to choose and anoint one of the sons of Jesse as a new king for Israel, the Lord told him to reject the first son, though he was a man of fine appearance. The Lord explained, \u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7.)\nWe are familiar with the proverb which states that as a man \u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he.\u201d (Prov. 23:7.) We also read in Proverbs: \u201cAll the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.\u201d (Prov. 16:2.)\nLatter-day revelation declares that the Lord requires not only the acts of the children of men, but \u201cthe Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind.\u201d (D&C 64:34.)\nNumerous scriptures teach that our Heavenly Father knows our thoughts and the intents of our heart. (See D&C 6:16; Mosiah 24:12; Alma 18:32.) The prophet Moroni taught that if our works are to be credited for good, they must be done for the right reasons. If a man \u201coffereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.\n\u201cFor behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.\u201d (Moro. 7:6\u20137.)\nSimilarly, the prophet Alma taught that if we have hardened our hearts against the word of God, we will \u201cnot dare to look up to our God\u201d at the final judgment because \u201call our works will condemn us; \u2026 and our thoughts will also condemn us.\u201d (Alma 12:14.)\nThese scriptures make clear that in order to purify our service in the Church and to our fellowmen, it is necessary to consider not only how we serve, but also why we serve.\nPeople serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.\nWhat are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.\nSome may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth. Others might serve in order to obtain worldly honors, prominence, or power.\nThe scriptures have a word for gospel service \u201cfor the sake of riches and honor\u201d; it is \u201cpriestcraft.\u201d (Alma 1:16.) Nephi said, \u201cPriestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.\u201d (2 Ne. 26:29.). In these latter days, we are commanded to \u201cseek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.\u201d (D&C 6:6.) Unfortunately, not all who accomplish works under that heading are really intending to build up Zion or strengthen the faith of the people of God. Other motives can be at work.\nService that is ostensibly unselfish but is really for the sake of riches or honor surely comes within the Savior\u2019s condemnation of those who \u201coutwardly appear righteous unto men, but within \u2026 are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\u201d (Matt. 23:28.) Such service earns no gospel reward.\n\u201cI would that ye should do alms unto the poor,\u201d the Savior declared, \u201cbut take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.\u201d (3 Ne. 13:1; see also Matt. 6:1\u20132.) The Savior continued:\n\u201cTherefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\u201d (3 Ne. 13:2; see also Matt. 6:2.)\nIn contrast, those who serve quietly, even \u201cin secret,\u201d qualify for the Savior\u2019s promise that \u201cthy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\u201d (3 Ne. 13:18; see also Matt. 6:4.)\nAnother reason for service\u2014probably more worthy than the first, but still in the category of service in search of earthly reward\u2014is that motivated by a personal desire to obtain good companionship. We surely have good associations in our Church service, but is that why we serve?\nI once knew a person who was active in Church service until a socially prominent friend and fellow worker moved away. When the friend moved from the ward, this person ceased to serve. In this case, a Church worker was willing to serve only when the fellow workers were acceptable.\nPersons who serve only to obtain good companionship are more selective in choosing their friends than the Master was in choosing his servants or associates. Jesus called most of his servants from those in humble circumstances. And he associated with sinners. He answered critics of such association by saying, \u201cThey that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d (Luke 5:31\u201332.)\nThe first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which speaks of people in the last days, gives a description that seems to include those who serve for hope of earthly reward of one sort or another: \u201cThey seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol.\u201d (D&C 1:16.)\nThese first two reasons for service are selfish and self-centered and unworthy of Saints. As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so \u201cto please ourselves.\u201d (Rom. 15:1.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.\nSome may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with \u201ca lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.\u201d (Mosiah 2:38.) Such descriptions surely offer sufficient incentive for keeping the commandment of service. But service out of fear of punishment is a lesser motive at best.\nOther persons may serve out of a sense of duty or out of loyalty to friends or family or traditions. These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.\nService of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:\n\u201cBut this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.\n\u201cEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\u201d (2 Cor. 9:6\u20137.)\n\u201cIt is obeying God willingly that is accepted,\u201d an anonymous writer has said. \u201cThe Lord hates that which is forced\u2014it is rather a tax than an offering.\u201d\nAlthough those who serve out of fear of punishment or out of a sense of duty undoubtedly qualify for the blessings of heaven, there are still higher reasons for service.\nOne such higher reason for service is the hope of an eternal reward. This hope\u2014the expectation of enjoying the fruits of our labors\u2014is one of the most powerful sources of motivation. As a reason for service, it necessarily involves faith in God and in the fulfillment of his prophecies. The scriptures are rich in promises of eternal rewards. For example, in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in June 1829, the Lord said: \u201cIf you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\u201d (D&C 14:7.)\nThe last motive I will discuss is, in my opinion, the highest reason of all. In its relationship to service, it is what the scriptures call \u201ca more excellent way.\u201d (1 Cor. 12:31.)\n\u201cCharity is the pure love of Christ.\u201d (Moro. 7:47.) The Book of Mormon teaches us that this virtue is \u201cthe greatest of all.\u201d (Moro. 7:46.) The Apostle Paul affirmed and illustrated that truth in his great teaching about the reasons for service:\n\u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. \u2026\n\u201cAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, \u2026 and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\u201d (1 Cor. 13:1\u20133.)\nWe know from these inspired words that even the most extreme acts of service\u2014such as giving all of our goods to feed the poor\u2014profit us nothing unless our service is motivated by the pure love of Christ.\nIf our service is to be most efficacious, it must be accomplished for the love of God and the love of his children. The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:\n\u201cFor if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?\n\u201cAnd if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?\u201d (Matt. 5:46\u201347.)\nThis principle\u2014that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive\u2014is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (Matt. 5:48.)\nThis principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:\n\u201cTherefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.\u201d (D&C 4:2.)\nWe learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our might and strength. He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our heart and mind.\nService with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.\nIf we have difficulty with the command that we serve for love, a Book of Mormon teaching can help us. After describing the importance of charity, the prophet Moroni counseled:\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.\u201d (Moro. 7:48.)\nThe service of persons filled with that love will meet the high test expressed in the Twenty-fourth Psalm:\n\u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?\n\u201cHe that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.\u201d (Ps. 24:3\u20134.)\nI know that God expects us to work to purify our hearts and our thoughts so that we may serve one another for the highest and best reason, the pure love of Christ.\nMost of all, I know that God lives, and I know that his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, died for our sins and is our Savior. And I know that God has restored the fulness of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in these latter days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDallin\u00a0H. Oaks\nWhy Do We Serve?\n1984\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I have prayed for the blessings of heaven to be upon my efforts in speaking to you today.\nMatthew\u2019s New Testament account includes these words of the Savior: \u201cEvery good tree bringeth forth good fruit\u201d (Matt. 7:17), and \u201cby their fruits ye shall know them\u201d\u2014whether they be good or evil (Matt. 7:20).\nAs Michael Watson was reading the Annual Report confirming the continued growth and expansion of the Church throughout the world, with an increasing number of new converts making possible more stakes and more wards with their increasing numbers of priesthood holders and women in their organizations, and with our growing numbers of missionaries making possible more new missions, I felt a burning in my soul\u2014a feeling of divine affirmation and direction of this work as it comes \u201cforth out of obscurity\u201d (D&C 1:30).\nThis is the church of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it does indeed bring forth fruit worthy of him. Its growth will continue unabated because of the faith of its members and because more men and women are discovering the golden threads of truth, hope, and salvation as they learn gospel principles and are \u201cnourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, \u2026 relying \u2026 upon the merits of Christ, who [is] the author \u2026 of their faith\u201d (Moro. 6:4).\nOutside of our church, many watch in amazement at this consistent expansion in spite of popular secularism. We hope they may one day know of the joy and happiness available to the Saints who hold fast to the iron rod of gospel truth (see 1 Ne. 11:25), which they treasure as dearly as life itself and which they maintain by their abiding faith.\nWe see the light of the gospel continuing to dawn like a gentle new day upon previous intolerable darkness. It continues to spread out into new frontiers, confirming the revelation to Joseph the Prophet that \u201cthe voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape\u201d (D&C 1:2) and all hearts shall be penetrated.\nThe gospel breathes a new life and a new hope and a new and unknown holiness into a troubled world. This we see, and we see the work grow and increase and become more and more irresistible as it spreads like the gentleness of a sea that refreshes the shore upon which it flows.\nWitnessing this miracle continuing to unfold today, I liken it to the account in Acts where Peter and other Apostles were preaching of Jesus, and the high priests\u2019 council and the Sadducees tried to restrain them from speaking and teaching of Christ by putting them in prison. But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, and again they went to the temple to teach the people. Gamaliel, a Pharisee and doctor of the law, halted the council when they would again cast the Apostles in prison, saying:\n\u201cRefrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:\n\u201cBut if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\n\u201cAnd to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak \u2026 the name of Jesus, and let them go.\n\u201cAnd they departed, \u2026 rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer \u2026 for his name\u201d (Acts 5:38\u201341).\nAnd\u2014true to their callings as special witnesses of Christ\u2014the Apostles went \u201cdaily in the temple, and in every house, they [continued] to teach and preach Jesus Christ\u201d and him crucified (Acts 5:42).\nThe early Apostles fearlessly continued to preach the principles of the gospel, as we do today, calling upon mankind to believe in the Son of God, our Savior, and to repent\u2014to repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins, and to receive the Holy Ghost in preparation to have administered unto them even higher ordinances of the gospel. Those early disciples declared to those seeking truth, in plainness, that as the Holy Ghost rested upon them, filling their hearts with joy, they would know of the doctrine for themselves, whether it be of God or man.\nThe Spirit of truth leads men to righteousness, but we must have a desire to seek truth and to take the time to form spiritual habits and respond to spiritual impressions if we are to keep our souls alive\u2014and is not now the time to begin?\nA person who has developed spirituality may suffer deeply and know frustration; but yet he is able to continue in showing forth kindness and love because of a power that rises up from his spiritual base that governs his actions and urges him to \u201cspeak with a new tongue\u201d (2 Ne. 31:14), as Nephi said, and to be his best despite obstacles and setbacks.\nMy desire is to aid the cause of truth and righteousness and, like the Apostles of old, to add my witness of the divinity of Jesus the Christ.\nTomorrow is Easter! Christians everywhere will commemorate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though the anniversary date may not be accurate, the Easter season should inspire us to study and reflect upon the infinite and eternal atonement of Christ\u2014\u201cthe firstfruits of them that slept\u201d (1 Cor. 15:20). The resurrection of Jesus from the tomb is the most glorious of all messages to mankind.\nI believe in Christ. As a Latter-day Saint, I believe in Christ with all my heart. We invite all to \u201ccome unto Christ, and be perfected in him,\u201d as Moroni declared, \u201cand deny yourselves of all ungodliness\u201d (Moro. 10:32). Without reservation, we declare he is the Son of God and the Savior of the world.\nJoseph Smith, the first prophet of this dispensation, wrote:\n\u201cWe believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\n\u201cWe believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel\u201d (A of F 1:1, 3).\nWe believe that Christ came into the world to ransom mankind from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the fall of Adam, that through the shedding of His innocent blood all mankind are raised in immortality and that those who believe and obey His laws are raised unto eternal life.\nSalvation is administered on the same terms and conditions in all ages. Men must have faith in him, repent of their sins, be baptized in his name, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and remain steadfast to gain life eternal.\nThe Lord God has sent his holy prophets among all men in all ages to declare these things, even as he does today (see Mosiah 3:13).\nKing Benjamin, a Book of Mormon prophet, was instructed by an angel sent by the Lord to declare unto his people the coming of the Messiah more than one hundred years before Christ\u2019s birth, \u201cthat they may also be filled with joy\u201d (Mosiah 3:4). This holy prophet declared:\n\u201cFor behold, the time cometh, \u2026 that \u2026 the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity, \u2026 shall come down from heaven among the children of men, \u2026\n\u201cAnd \u2026 he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, \u2026 even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; \u2026 blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.\n\u201cAnd he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, \u2026 the Creator of all things from the beginning; \u2026\n\u201cAnd lo, he cometh \u2026 that salvation might come \u2026 through faith on his name; \u2026 [but] they shall consider him a man, \u2026 and shall scourge him, and \u2026 crucify him.\n\u201cAnd he shall rise the third day from the dead\u201d (Mosiah 3:5, 7\u201310).\nKing Benjamin had learned in a vision that Christ would atone for the sins of mankind and judge the world. New Testament narrators, who were actual witnesses, confirmed King Benjamin\u2019s prophetic declarations with this brief account:\nBefore daylight the second morning following Christ\u2019s crucifixion, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, having prepared fresh spices and ointments, went to the tomb of Jesus and found that the stone had been rolled away. Looking in and not finding the body, they hurried to find Peter and the Apostles and told them what they had found. Peter and John hastened at once to the tomb. John outran his older companion. Stooping down, he gazed in silent wonder into the empty tomb. Entering, Peter saw the burial clothes lying where the body of Jesus once lay. John followed him. And in spite of fear, there dawned upon them the hope, which later would become an absolute knowledge, that Christ had indeed risen; but as yet no one had seen him. The two wondering Apostles returned to their brethren.\nMary had stayed at the tomb and was grieving at the entrance when someone approached. Thinking it was the keeper of the garden, she asked where he had laid her Lord. Jesus said to her, \u201cMary\u201d (John 20:16).\nJesus himself was standing before her, but he did not appear as she had known him, for he was now risen and glorified. She then recognized our Lord and must have attempted to embrace him, for he said, \u201cTouch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God\u201d (John 20:17).\nFilled with amazement, she hastened to obey, and repeated that glorious message which would give hope through all future ages and to which she added her personal declaration that she had seen the risen Lord (see John 20:1\u201318).\n\u201cThe debt is paid, the redemption made, the covenant fulfilled, justice satisfied, the will of God done,\u201d wrote President John Taylor, \u201cand all power is now given into the hands of the Son of God\u2014the power of the resurrection, the power of the redemption, [and] the power of salvation\u201d (Mediation and Atonement, Salt Lake City: Deseret News Co., 1882, p. 171).\nHundreds of years before Christ\u2019s earthly ministry, the prophet Isaiah, foretelling of the establishment of Zion and speaking of Jehovah, the true God, wrote:\n\u201cSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: \u2026\n\u201cBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: \u2026 and with his stripes we are healed\u201d (Isa. 53:4\u20135).\nThese thoughtful words from a favorite Mormon sacrament hymn express our heartfelt gratitude for our Savior:\nThere was no other good enough\nTo pay the price of sin.\nHe only could unlock the gate\nOf heav\u2019n and let us in.\nOh, dearly, dearly has he loved!\nAnd we must love him too,\nAnd trust in his redeeming blood,\nAnd try his works to do.\nI repeat our Lord\u2019s ageless admonition, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments\u201d (John 14:15).\nInnumerable blessings have been promised to those who are faithful and obedient to God\u2019s laws. Once a person is true and obedient to the light and knowledge received, he not only develops the ability to use that which has been given but the capacity to receive more knowledge increases, for he now understands and appreciates the gift.\nPeople learn obedience by being obedient. We see its fruits. Halfhearted obedience is without reward. The gospel invites vigorous participation in living its principles. God commands that we serve him with all our heart, with all our might, with all our strength, and with the very best of our intelligence.\nOur Savior instructs us, \u201cThy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times\u201d (D&C 59:11).\nIf we could feel or were sensitive even in the slightest to the matchless love of our Savior and his willingness to suffer for our individual sins, we would cease procrastination and \u201cclean the slate,\u201d and repent of all our transgressions.\nThis would mean keeping God\u2019s commandments and setting our lives in order, searching our souls, and repenting of our sins, large or small. It means loving our neighbor, living an exemplary life, and\u2014high on the list\u2014being good husbands and good wives. It means teaching our children, by example and precept, to walk in the ways of truth and soberness. It means being honest in our affairs, and serving others, which includes sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world, and\u2014with love\u2014to succor those in need.\nIt is my hope that we will all come to know and love our Lord through obedience to his Word sufficiently to qualify for inclusion in the blessed circle of those who have heard of and believed his precious words uttered in the Garden of Gethsemane, his last night in mortality: \u201cAnd this is life eternal,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (John 17:3), to which I add my witness in his holy name, amen.\nDavid B.

Amen.\n"}, {"text": "We have come to the close of these glorious days of great spiritual uplift, during which we have listened to words of inspiration and revelation from our presiding brethren. We have been blessed by hearing praises to the Lord sung by this great Tabernacle Choir.\nWe have all felt the outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord as we have assembled in his name to worship and be instructed by the power of the Holy Ghost. This has always been the pattern of the meetings of the saints, for we read in the Book of Mormon the words of Moroni, who said:\n\u201cAnd their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.\u201d (Moro. 6:9.)\nWe have been counseled in the ways of righteousness, urged to be faithful and to keep the commandments of God, to love the Lord and our fellowmen. We have been warned against the pitfalls of following the ways of Satan and counseled to resist evil by being humble, prayerful, and submissive to the constant promptings of the Spirit. We have this great promise from the Lord given in our day:\n\u201cAssuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive. \u2026\n\u201cYea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.\n\u201cNow, behold, this is the spirit of revelation. \u2026\u201d (D&C 8:1\u20133.)\nOf all things, that for which we should be most grateful today is that the heavens are indeed open and that the restored church of Jesus Christ is founded upon the rock of revelation. Continuous revelation is indeed the very lifeblood of the gospel of the living Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nWe proclaim to the world in one of our Articles of Faith, \u201cWe believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.\u201d [A of F 1:9]\nFrom the scripture of ancient time comes this ringing declaration: \u201cSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\u201d (Amos 3:7.)\nThis postulation to the prophet Amos has come down from antiquity and speaks of the Lord \u201cJesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\u201d (Heb. 13:8.)\nWe read of the unchangeable Lord in the holy scriptures. In the Bible, which we proclaim \u201cto be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly\u201d [A of F 1:8], the Old Testament prophets from Adam to Malachi are testifying of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ was the God of the Old Testament, and it was He who conversed with Abraham and Moses. It was He who inspired Isaiah and Jeremiah; it was He who foretold through those chosen men the happenings of the future, even to the latest day and hour.\nAnd the New Testament is what it implies\u2014a new, additional witness and testimony of the sonship of Jesus Christ and the fatherhood of the Father and the divinity of this work, and the necessity of living the gospel, which he outlined and proclaimed.\nWe do not accept the theory of the so-called teachers of Christianity, that the Old Testament constituted the total words of God\u2019s prophets; nor do we believe the New Testament to be the end of revelation. We testify that rather than an end of revelations of God, they continue to pour forth from God for the welfare and benefit of men.\nI believe with Peter of old who said: \u201cFor the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u201d (2 Pet. 1:21.)\nHow this confused world of today needs revelation from God. With war and pestilence and famine, with poverty, desolation, with more and more graft, dishonesty, and immorality, certainly the people of this world need revelation from God as never before. How absurd it would be to think that the Lord would give to a small handful of people in Palestine and the Old World his precious direction through revelation and now, in our extremity, close the heavens.\nHowever, it is the sad truth that if prophets and people are unreachable, the Lord generally does nothing for them. Having given them free agency, their Heavenly Father calls, persuades, and directs aright his children, but waits for their upreaching hands, their solemn prayers, their sincere, dedicated approach to him. If they are heedless, they are left floundering in midnight\u2019s darkness when they could have the noonday sun.\nWhen the children of Israel would not live the commandments, believe in him, and follow his program, the Lord said: \u201cAnd I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:\n\u201cAnd your strength shall be spent. \u2026\u201d (Lev. 26:19\u201320.)\nIf the Bible were \u201cthe end of the prophets,\u201d then it was through lack of faith and belief, and that is the reason the heavens at times were closed and locked and became as iron, and the earth as brass. When the heavens are sealed, the spiritual darkness that follows is not unlike that physical darkness in Nephite history, when \u201cneither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood.\u201d (3 Ne. 8:21.)\nThe Lord will not force himself upon people, and if they do not believe, they will receive no revelation. If they are content to depend upon their own limited calculations and interpretations, then, of course, the Lord will leave them to their chosen fate.\nSpeaking of miracles and revelation, the Book of Mormon prophet Moroni states this:\n\u201cIf these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.\u201d (Moro. 7:38.)\nIn the meridian of time, the Son of God, the Light of the World, came and opened the curtains of heaven, and earth and heaven were again in communion.\nBut when the light of that century went out, the darkness was again impenetrable; the heavens were sealed and the \u201cdark ages\u201d moved in.\nI bear witness to the world today that more than a century and a half ago the iron ceiling was shattered; the heavens were once again opened, and since that time revelations have been continuous.\nThat new day dawned when another soul with passionate yearning prayed for divine guidance. A spot of hidden solitude was found, knees were bent, a heart was humbled, pleadings were voiced, and a light brighter than the noonday sun illuminated the world\u2014the curtain never to be closed again.\nA young lad spoken of by some of our brethren today, Joseph Smith, of incomparable faith, broke the spell, shattered the \u201cheavens of iron\u201d and reestablished communication. Heaven kissed the earth, light dissipated the darkness, and God again spoke to man, revealing anew \u201chis secret unto his servants the prophets.\u201d (Amos 3:7.) A new prophet was in the land and through him God set up his kingdom, never to be destroyed nor left to another people\u2014a kingdom that will stand forever.\nThe foreverness of this kingdom and the revelations which it brought into existence are absolute realities. Never again will the sun go down; never again will all men prove totally unworthy of communication with their Maker. Never again will God be hidden from his children on the earth. Revelation is here to remain.\nIn the early years of his newly established dispensation, the Lord set his divine law of succession, and prophets have followed each other and will continue to follow each other in never-ending, divinely appointed succession, and the secrets of the Lord will be revealed without measure.\nBy the power of God other books of scripture have come into being. Vital and priceless records of ancient America, with teachings of Christ, another testimony of his divinity, form the Book of Mormon, which we declare to be divine scripture, contemporary with and sustaining the Bible.\nSince that momentous day in 1820, additional scripture has continued to come, including the numerous and vital revelations flowing in a never-ending stream from God to his prophets on the earth. Many of these revelations are recorded in another scripture called the Doctrine and Covenants. Completing our Latter-day Saint scriptures is the Pearl of Great Price, another record of revelation and translated writings of both ancient and modern prophets.\nThere are those who would assume that with the printing and binding of these sacred records, that would be the \u201cend of the prophets.\u201d But again we testify to the world that revelation continues and that the vaults and files of the Church contain these revelations which come month to month and day to day. We testify also that there is, since 1830 when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, and will continue to be, so long as time shall last, a prophet, recognized of God and his people, who will continue to interpret the mind and will of the Lord.\nNow, a word of warning: Let us not make the error of the ancients. Numerous modern sectarians believe in the Abrahams, the Moseses, and the Pauls, but resist believing in today\u2019s prophets. The ancients also could accept the prophets of an earlier day, but denounced and cursed the ones who were their contemporaries.\nIn our day, as in times past, many people expect that if there be revelation it will come with awe-inspiring, earth-shaking display. For many it is hard to accept as revelation those numerous ones in Moses\u2019 time, in Joseph\u2019s time, and in our own year\u2014those revelations which come to prophets as deep, unassailable impressions settling down on the prophet\u2019s mind and heart as dew from heaven or as the dawn dissipates the darkness of night.\nExpecting the spectacular, one may not be fully alerted to the constant flow of revealed communication. I say, in the deepest of humility, but also by the power and force of a burning testimony in my soul, that from the prophet of the Restoration to the prophet of our own year, the communication line is unbroken, the authority is continuous, and light, brilliant and penetrating, continues to shine. The sound of the voice of the Lord is a continuous melody and a thunderous appeal. For nearly a century and a half there has been no interruption.\nMan never needs to stand alone. Every faithful person may have the inspiration for his own limited kingdom. But the Lord definitely calls prophets today and reveals his secrets unto them as he did yesterday, he does today, and will do tomorrow: that is the way it is.\nAs we sang \u201cWe Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet\u201d earlier in the afternoon, a thought ran through my mind which I have expressed before. I hope you were all thinking of Joseph Smith, of Brigham Young, of John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and all the other Presidents. I hope you were thinking of President David O. McKay and President Joseph Fielding Smith, President Harold B. Lee and all of those who have filled this position in these days.\nThey have contributed a great service. They have done a great work for the people of this world. They have organized the Church and continued to develop it, and it has grown tremendously under their care.\nI hope we will always remember that and not let it all be centered in the living person who currently serves, because the works of God continue in all these areas.\nBefore I close I should like to mention two other matters. One, I hope you have had the opportunity to see the four beautiful statues that have been placed just east of the temple in the central Church plaza. These four are a part of the group of thirteen statues honoring women that will be set up next year in the Relief Society park in Nauvoo, at the visitors center there. These four have been placed in the plaza for your enjoyment. They are lovely indeed. We invite you to visit that area and see the statues while you are here in Salt Lake City.\nI was impressed when Elder Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of Joseph Smith so tenderly, and sweetly, and the thought went through my mind of that last night in Carthage, Illinois. They were gathered together with the mob all around them and the Prophet Joseph Smith asked one of the brethren to sing for him \u201cA Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.\u201d\nA poor wayfaring Man of grief\nHath often crossed me on my way,\nWho sued so humbly for relief\nThat I could never answer, Nay.\nI had not power to ask his name,\nWhereto he went, or whence he came;\nYet there was something in his eye\nThat won my love; I knew not why.\nOnce, when my scanty meal was spread,\nHe entered, not a word he spake;\nJust perishing for want of bread,\nI gave him all he blessed it, brake,\nAnd ate, but gave me part again;\nMine was an angel\u2019s portion then,\nFor while I fed with eager haste,\nThe crust was manna to my taste.\nI spied him where a fountain burst\nClear from the rock; his strength was gone;\nThe heedless water mocked his thirst;\nHe heard it, saw it, hurrying on.\nI ran and raised the sufferer up;\nThrice from the stream he drained my cup,\nDipped and returned it running o\u2019er;\nI drank and never thirsted more.\nTwas night; the floods were out; it blew\nA winter hurricane aloof;\nI heard his voice abroad and flew\nTo bid him welcome to my roof.\nI warmed and clothed and cheered my guest\nAnd laid him on my couch to rest,\nThen made the earth my bed, and seemed\nIn Eden\u2019s garden while I dreamed.\nStript, wounded, beaten nigh to death,\nI found him by the highway side;\nI roused his pulse, brought back his breath,\nRevived his spirit, and supplied\nWine, oil, refreshment\u2014he was healed;\nI had myself a wound concealed,\nBut from that hour forgot the smart,\nAnd peace bound up my broken heart.\nIn prison I saw him next, condemned\nTo meet a traitor\u2019s doom at morn;\nThe tide of lying tongues I stemmed,\nAnd honored him \u2019mid shame and scorn.\nMy friendship\u2019s utmost zeal to try,\nHe asked if I for him would die;\nThe flesh was weak; my blood ran chill;\nBut the free spirit cried, \u201cI will!\u201d\nThen in a moment to my view\nThe stranger started from disguise;\nThe tokens in his hands I knew;\nThe Savior stood before mine eyes.\nHe spake, and my poor name he named\n\u201cOf me thou hast not been ashamed;\nThese deeds shall thy memorial be,\nFear not, thou didst them unto me.\u201d\nGod bless you, brothers and sisters. It has been a wonderful conference and a joy to mingle with you these days. Peace be with you; and may his joy and peace continue with you. We know it is true. I know the Lord lives and I know that he is revealing his mind and will to us daily, so that we can be inspired as to the direction to go.\nWe ask this all, with our affection for you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nSpencer W. Kimball\nRevelation: The Word of the Lord to His Prophets\n1977\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Several years ago I needed to speak to the wife of one of the bishops in our stake, so I called their home. A young son answered the phone. I said, \u201cHello. Is your mother there?\u201d\nHis reply: \u201cYes, she is. I\u2019ll get her. Who is this?\u201d\nMy response: \u201cTell her it\u2019s President Nielsen.\u201d\nThere was a short pause, and then, in a very animated voice, I heard, \u201cHey, Mom, President Hinckley\u2019s on the phone!\u201d\nI can\u2019t imagine what she must have been thinking. It had to be the longest walk to the phone she ever had. The thought did cross my mind: \u201cShould I?\u201d I didn\u2019t, but we had quite a laugh. Now that I think about it, she must have been so disappointed just talking to me.\nWhat would you do if the prophet of the Lord really called you? Well, he has! President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson, as he did once again this morning, has called each one of us to a very important work. He said, \u201cNow is the time for members and missionaries to come together, to work together, to labor in the Lord\u2019s vineyard to bring souls unto Him\u201d (\u201cFaith in the Work of Salvation\u201d [worldwide leadership training broadcast, June 2013]; lds.org/broadcasts).\nHave we been listening?\nAll over the world, stakes, districts, and missions are experiencing a new level of energy, as the Savior\u2019s declaration to Joseph Smith in 1832 is being fulfilled: \u201cBehold, I will hasten my work in its time\u201d (D&C 88:73).\nBrothers and sisters, that time is now! I feel it, and I\u2019m sure you do also.\nI wanted to put my excitement and my faith in Jesus Christ into action. When I played football, I thought in terms of game plans. There was no question going into a contest that if our team was prepared with the right plays, we were going to be successful. However, I recently spoke with BYU\u2019s legendary coach LaVell Edwards about our game plans, and he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t care what play you called just as long as we scored a touchdown!\u201d As one of his quarterbacks, I thought it was much more complex than that, but maybe his simple philosophy is the reason he has a stadium named after him.\nSince we are all on the Lord\u2019s team, do we each have our own winning game plan? Are we ready to play? If we, as members, really loved our family, friends, and associates, wouldn\u2019t we want to share our testimony of the restored gospel with them?\nAt the seminar for new mission presidents held in June, a record 173 new presidents and their wives received final instructions before beginning their service. All 15 members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles addressed this special group.\nElder L.\u00a0Tom Perry added the concluding comments: \u201cThis is the most remarkable era in the history of the Church. This is something that ranks with the great events that have happened in past history, like the First Vision, like the gift of the Book of Mormon, like the Restoration of the gospel, like all of the things that build that foundation for us to go forward and teach in our Father in Heaven\u2019s kingdom\u201d (\u201cConcluding Remarks\u201d [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 26, 2013], 1, Church History Library, Salt Lake City).\nWe need to be engaged as never before to match the excitement of our leaders and the commitment of our full-time missionaries. This work is not going to move forward in the Lord\u2019s intended way without us! As President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring has said, \u201cWhatever our age, capacity, Church calling, or location, we are as one called to the work to help Him in His harvest of souls\u201d (\u201cWe Are One,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 62).\nMay I share with you a game plan I\u2019ve felt impressed to implement after praying, reading chapter 13 of Preach My Gospel, and pondering past experiences? I invite you to consider these three points as you think about your own plan.\nFirst, specifically pray to bring someone closer to the Savior and His gospel every day. You could do this by seeing all people as sons and daughters of God helping each other on their journey home. Think of the new friends you would make.\nSecond, pray for the missionaries serving in your area and their investigators by name every day. The only way to do this is to greet them, look at their badge, call them by name, and ask them who they are teaching. Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson wisely contributed, \u201cUntil you know a person\u2019s name and face, the Lord cannot help you know his or her heart.\u201d\nI attended the baptism of a wonderful sister, who shared her testimony. I will forever remember her saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never had so many people praying for me and feeling so much love! I know this work is true!\u201d\nThird, invite a friend to an activity in or out of your home. Wherever you go or whatever you do, ponder who would enjoy the occasion and then listen to the Spirit as He directs you.\nThe Savior has taught me a subtle lesson in my personal gospel learning which, I believe, applies beautifully to \u201cthe hastening.\u201d When I\u2019m emotionally charged about something, it shows in my writing and often ends in an exclamation point that by definition conveys a \u201cstrong feeling [or an] indication of major significance\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th ed. [2003], \u201cexclamation point\u201d).\nI became intrigued as scriptures about \u201cthe gathering\u201d which ended with this punctuation mark started popping up, like Alma\u2019s heartfelt plea: \u201cO that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\u201d (Alma 29:1).\nResearch suggests there are 65 passages showing this kind of strong missionary emotion, including these:\n\u201cHow great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\n\u201cAnd now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\u201d (D&C 18:13, 15\u201316).\nMy awakening to these unique verses played an important role in my first assignment as an Area Seventy. I was a bit nervous being the companion of an Apostle, Elder Quentin\u00a0L. Cook, at a stake conference. As I walked into the stake president\u2019s office for the initial meeting that weekend, I noticed a pair of tattered-looking, bronzed shoes on the credenza behind his desk, accompanied by a scripture ending in an exclamation point. As I read it, I felt the Lord was aware of my study, had answered my prayers, and that He knew exactly what I needed to soothe my anxious heart.\nI asked the stake president to tell me the story of the shoes.\nHe said:\n\u201cThese are shoes of a young convert to the Church whose family situation was strained, yet he was determined to serve a successful mission and did so in Guatemala. Upon his return I met with him to extend an honorable release and saw his shoes were worn out. This young man had given his all to the Lord without much, if any, family support.\n\u201cHe noticed I was staring at his shoes and asked me, \u2018President, is anything wrong?\u2019\n\u201cI responded, \u2018No, Elder, everything is right! Can I have those shoes?\u2019\u201d\nThe stake president continued: \u201cMy respect and love for this returning missionary was overwhelming! I wanted to memorialize the experience, so I had his shoes bronzed. It is a reminder to me when I walk into this office of the effort we all must give regardless of our circumstances. The verse was from Isaiah: \u2018How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\u2019 (Isaiah 52:7).\u201d\nMy dear brothers and sisters, the good bishop\u2019s wife may have been wondering why the prophet was calling her. I testify she and we need wonder no more\u2014EXCLAMATION POINT!\nI know we each must develop and carry out our own personal game plan to serve with enthusiasm alongside the full-time missionaries\u2014EXCLAMATION POINT!\nI add my testimony to that of the Prophet Joseph Smith: \u201cAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!\u201d (D&C 76:22). In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder S.\u00a0Gifford Nielsen\nHastening the Lord\u2019s Game Plan!\n2013\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "4/8/23, 5:04 PM\nThe Gathering of Israel\nThe Gathering of Israel\nOld Testament prophecies reassured the children of Israel that,\nalthough they would be scattered among the nations, they would also\none day be gathered again. 1 The newly translated Book of Mormon and\nthe Lord\u2019s revelations to Joseph Smith taught early Latter-day Saints\nthat they lived in the time in which the promised gathering would\nbegin. This gathering would occur as they preached throughout the\nworld, bringing the gospel to the scattered descendants of Israel and to\nall who desired to be adopted into the covenant family. At the same\ntime, the Saints were to build a \u201ccity of Zion\u201d to which converts could\ngather in preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. 2\nWithin months of the organization of the Church in 1830, a revelation\nto Joseph Smith instructed newly baptized members to leave their\nhomes and gather \u201cin unto one place upon the face of this land.\u201d 3\nFurther revelation designated Ohio as the first place of gathering. 4\nWhile believers flocked to Kirtland, Ohio, a revelation to Joseph Smith\nidentified an area near the village of Independence in Jackson County,\nMissouri, as the place to begin building the city of Zion. 5 The Saints\nwere expelled from the county in 1833, preventing them from building\nthe promised city, but they continued to establish settlements in\nsurrounding counties to which converts could gather.\nThe gathering gained further impetus in April 1836 when the Old\nTestament prophet Moses appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver\nCowdery in the Kirtland Temple and gave them the \u201ckeys of the\ngathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of\nthe ten tribes from the Land of the North.\u201d 6 Apostles Heber C. Kimball\nand Orson Hyde were soon called to England, establishing the\nChurch\u2019s first overseas mission. 7 Thousands of converts began to flock\nto Latter-day Saint stakes in Ohio, Missouri, and later, Illinois. In\nNauvoo, Illinois, the Saints established a large stake and began\nbuilding a new temple. Joseph Smith taught that in one sense, \u201cthe\nwhole America is Zion,\u201d and the Saints could gather anywhere so long\nas there was a temple. 8 He explained that the \u201cmain object\u201d of the\ngathering was \u201cto build unto the Lord an house whereby He could\nreveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and glories of His\nkingdom and teach the people the ways of salvation.\u201d 9\nAfter Joseph Smith\u2019s death, the Saints migrated to the American West,\nwhere they continued to establish stakes of Zion and build temples. In\n1848 Church leaders urged converts in Europe to \u201cemigrate as speedily\nas possible\u201d to the Great Basin. 10 New members abroad\u2014especially\nthose in Great Britain and Scandinavia\u2014eagerly followed Church\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/gathering-of-israel?lang=eng\n1/54/8/23, 5:04 PM\nThe Gathering of Israel\nleaders\u2019 instructions, so much so that Latter-day Saint settlements faced\nchallenges supporting and integrating the large numbers of immigrants\neconomically. 11 In the missions, the constant flow of converts away from\nlocal branches toward the stakes in Utah made proselytizing efforts\nmore difficult. Finally, in 1887, United States antipolygamy legislation\ndisincorporated the Church\u2019s Perpetual Emigrating Fund, limiting the\nChurch\u2019s ability to aid immigration in the way it had since 1849. 12\nChurch leaders in the 1890s began encouraging new members to remain\nin their homelands. In 1894, for instance, the First Presidency and\nQuorum of the Twelve Apostles decided that members far from Utah\n\u201cshould not be encouraged to emigrate until they are firmly grounded\nin the religion by labor and experience\u201d and that those who were\nalready financially well employed should \u201cnot be encouraged to\nemigrate to this place, where labor is so scarce.\u201d 13 But the earlier\ndirective to gather to Zion continued to appeal to some members, and\nleaders felt they could not in good conscience discourage members\nfrom migrating if they desired and had the means to do so. The\nLiverpool mission office continued serving as an emigration agency\nuntil the British Mission headquarters was relocated to London in 1933,\nthough immigration continued to decline steadily. 14\nIn 1952 President David O. McKay traveled to Europe to select sites for\ntemples in England and Switzerland. While there, he told a reporter,\n\u201cWe aim to keep our adherents here instead of encouraging them to\nimmigrate to Utah and other places in the United States.\u201d 15 He\nexplained that the presence of temples would bring the blessings of\nZion to the Saints in Europe. Subsequent Presidents of the Church\ncontinued to pursue the goal of building temples wherever there were\nlarge concentrations of Saints. In 1977 Elder Bruce R. McConkie\nreiterated that Zion exists wherever individuals gather together into the\ntrue fold of God through baptism and covenant. Referencing the people\nof Enoch, Elder McConkie taught, \u201cTo create a stake is like founding a\nCity of Holiness. Every stake on earth is the gathering place for the lost\nsheep of Israel who live in its area.\u201d 16 The proliferation of temples and\nstakes throughout the world has provided Latter-day Saints with the\nadvantages and blessings of gathering while also assisting in the\ncontinued gathering of God\u2019s children in their own lands.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/gathering-of-israel?lang=eng\n2/54/8/23, 5:04 PM\nThe Gathering of Israel\nChurch Resources\nRichard Lyman Bushman and Dean C.

I watched the raising of your hands when President Monson was presenting the sustaining of the General Authorities of the Church, but particularly our prophet, and as I watched those hands and the enthusiasm with which you raised them, I thought, \u201cHere we are with all the blessings we have and the comfort that we have,\u201d and I thought of some other such events that took place in the history of the Church.\nIn my mind\u2019s eye, I thought of the gatherings of our own family, which is scattered across America\u2014in Georgia; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Pennsylvania; Texas; California; and here in Salt Lake City. Of those little families in whatever the setting might be, there in their home or in the chapel, I thought I could see some of those little ones being taught to raise their hands and to be in harmony, perhaps their parents teaching them what we were doing. When we raised our hands, we not only just did it in motion because it looks like everybody\u2019s doing it, but because we accept and we\u2019re bearing witness about the knowledge we have and the testimony we have that President Hinckley is our prophet and our leader. We not only raise our hands in saying we sustain but that we follow his direction, that we listen, that we counsel, that we pray about it, that we\u2019re mindful of what comes from the lips of the prophet.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith had received some instruction regarding the organization of the Church, which we have by way of revelation as set forth in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Imagine\u2014on April the 6th, 1830, in Fayette, New York, in the Peter Whitmer farmhouse\u2014a meeting in that little log cabin, maybe 20 by 30 feet, where the Church was organized. Just imagine in that little setting, where he blessed Oliver and Oliver blessed him, as they followed the direction that they had received and the Church organization was presented to that little assembly.\nJoseph and Oliver and Hyrum and Samuel Smith and the two Whitmers had been baptized and acted in order to be \u201cagreeable to the laws\u201d of New York (D&C 20:1). But just imagine as you run through your mind the spiritual setting in that assembly and the feeling that they must have had as the proposition was presented to them to sustain\u2014what we have done here today\u2014to sustain the Prophet and Oliver as the first elders, to set the Church in motion. Some of the diaries and the accounts of that occasion indicate they had the feeling of heavenly beings in that meeting.\nSome were rebaptized. Some were baptized on that occasion for the first time, including the Prophet\u2019s father and mother\u2014just imagine! The sacrament was served for the first time in this dispensation in an official meeting of the Church, now organized. Imagine the feeling of the passing of the bread and the water, emblems of the torn flesh and the spilt blood of the Savior.\nImagine another setting of the sustaining in 1844, after the Prophet and Hyrum had been martyred, and of the meeting called in Nauvoo when Sidney Rigdon had now come from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hopefully to take over as\u201dguardian\u201d and to be the leader of the Church. The members of the Twelve were hurrying from various parts of the world, returning to Nauvoo. Think of that setting and the meeting when Sidney Rigdon presented the proposition that he would logically be the one to be called because he was the First Counselor, even though he was in some disfavor with the Prophet. And imagine Brigham Young being there and speaking for the Twelve, explaining to that body of Saints how the faithful brethren had been taught by the Prophet regarding the Twelve and the authority that rested with the Twelve.\nAfter they had presented both sides of the case and the voting took place, some of them stated that they saw and felt a change in Brigham Young as he spoke, that they thought they heard the voice of the Prophet, that they thought they could even see some facial features of the Prophet upon Brigham Young. I\u2019m saying this to you because as the years go on and as we learn more and as we\u2019re more sensitive to the spiritual direction that is in this work, we sense and feel the hand of the Lord in it. But think of the sustaining in that setting in 1844, to have the Church rest in the hands of the Twelve.\nThen there was another setting later on, in 1847, when the Saints were accumulating on the Iowa side of the Missouri River. Brigham Young had been here in the Salt Lake Valley with that first company of the Saints, but in December he had gone back to the Missouri to meet with the Saints there. And in a setting in Kanesville, there were nine of the Twelve assembled: two were in the valley here, one had gone to Texas, and nine were there. In that setting, in the Orson Hyde home, the First Presidency was reorganized on December the 5th, 1847, but they needed to have it ratified by the Saints. And so that meeting was postponed for three weeks so they could build a little log tabernacle in Kanesville. And in three weeks, with the workmen there and the members of the Church who had come in by wagons getting ready to cross the Missouri and head for the valley, they built a little tabernacle.\nIn that meeting was presented a proposition that the Presidency of the Church would be reorganized, but they needed a sustaining like we\u2019ve done here today, like that opportunity that is ours to raise our hands and sustain the prophet. So the First Presidency was reorganized; Brigham Young had selected Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards to be his counselors. Thus, it takes the sustaining of the people to give the leaders of the Church the authority that the Lord has designated by revelation that is necessary.\nAnd so, as we see the work move forward and move on, I would only declare to you as I stand before you today that in those 90 and more years that I\u2019ve had, as I\u2019ve witnessed and felt and seen and been part of the spiritual experiences that have been mine, this is the work of the Lord. It\u2019s just as has been revealed. I\u2019ve sensed it and I feel it, and I so declare to you.\nI remind you that the Savior taught, as recorded in Matthew, that whosoever \u201cfindeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it\u201d (Matt. 10:39). Now, some scholars and others have thought: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a paradox. It\u2019s probably a mistranslation. It really doesn\u2019t make very good sense.\u201d It\u2019s very clear in my mind, and I hope it is in yours, that as we live in the world of materialism, in Babylon that we live in today, and see the happenings of the world, whether you read the financial pages or the political pages or whatever, you can sense and feel that where we find our strength and where we find the answer to our challenges and our problems would be as we listen to the voice of the prophet\u2014God\u2019s prophet here upon the earth.\nIn that statement of the Savior\u2019s, we see that as we live in the materialistic world, we\u2019re concerned with only the materialistic side of life. We think of all we can accumulate for ourselves. We\u2019re not thinking of others or not living to help other people live on a higher plane. The Lord is saying that when you find the life that He exemplifies, then you lose your self-centered life: \u201cBut he that loseth his life for my sake. \u2026\u201d\nWhen we\u2019re concerned about doing something for someone else and when we\u2019re thinking about sharing the gospel or helping someone move on to a higher plane morally or physically, when we\u2019re doing something for someone else and sharing with them, then we\u2019re coming to their aid, we\u2019re coming to their rescue. In all that, we find the life that the Savior talks about, the eternal blessings, the heavenly blessings, the temple blessings, all of those blessings of a loving family that we can have.\nI leave you my love, my witness, my knowledge, and my own testimony that God lives, He is our Father, that we are children of God, and as the little, simple song says:\nI am a child of God,\nAnd he has sent me here,\nHas given me an earthly home\nWith parents kind and dear.\nLead me, guide me,\nWalk beside me,\nHelp me find the way.\nTeach me all that I must do\nTo live with him someday.\nIt\u2019s as simple, it\u2019s as pure and as clean as that little, simple song. It teaches us what we need to know. I\u2019m happy on this day and honored to have raised my hand in sustaining President Gordon Bitner Hinckley as President of the Church, and his counselors, Thomas S. Monson and James E. Faust, as the Presidency\u2014with the Quorum of the Twelve and all of the other General Authorities. The gospel is true; it is the hope of the world; it will move onward to accomplish all that it must do. I so leave you my love and witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDavid B.

Our culture and its related traditions help establish our sense of identity and fill the vital human need to belong.\nOf traditions which are complementary to the gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul admonished the Thessalonians, \u201cTherefore, \u2026 stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught\u201d (2 Thes. 2:15). In the Church, powerful traditions remind us of the strength and sacrifice of our ancestors and inspire our efforts. Among them are industry, frugality, and complete devotion to a righteous cause. Others are based on doctrine and standards which may seem peculiar to the world but are consistent with God\u2019s pattern. These include chaste behavior, modesty of dress, unpolluted language, Sabbath observance, adherence to the Word of Wisdom, and the payment of tithes.\nEven in ethnic culture, many traditions can reinforce gospel standards and principles. For example, anciently, Hawaiians had a practice, the spirit of which is still exhibited today by many in the islands. When greeting another person, one would come face-to-face and offer an expression of \u201cha,\u201d even expelling their breath for another to feel. The literal translation of ha is \u201cthe breath of life.\u201d It was a way to give of oneself and show another a deep sense of brotherly love and caring. When foreigners first came to Hawaii, they did not exhibit this same respect for others. They were called haole, ha-ole, meaning \u201cwithout ha.\u201d\nIf there is a people who should have \u201cha,\u201d an intense feeling of charity and compassion toward others, it is members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A true Latter-day Saint possesses a love for others that is consistent with a belief that everyone is a brother or a sister.\nUplifting traditions play a significant role in leading us toward the things of the Spirit. Those that promote love for Deity and unity in families and among people are especially important.\nThe power of tradition, however, poses a significant danger. It can cause us to forget our heavenly heritage. To achieve eternal goals, we must reconcile our earthly culture with the doctrine of the everlasting gospel. This process involves embracing all that is spiritually elevating in our family and societal traditions and discarding that which is a barrier to our eternal view and achievement. We must transform ourselves from being \u201cnatural\u201d men and women as defined by King Benjamin, and \u201cbecometh a saint\u201d by yielding \u201cto the enticings of the Holy Spirit\u201d (see Mosiah 3:19).\nAlso warning of this peril and its gravity, the Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired to clarify one of Paul\u2019s epistles to the people of Corinth by stating, \u201cAnd it came to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection to the law of Moses, gave heed to the traditions of their fathers and believed not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became unholy\u201d (D&C 74:4).\nPlease be not dismissive and think this principle applies only to others and their culture; know that it is valid for you and for me, wherever on earth we may live or whatever our family circumstances may be.\nUnwanted traditions are those which lead us away from performing holy ordinances and keeping sacred covenants. Our guide should be the doctrine taught by the scriptures and the prophets. Traditions which devalue marriage and family, abase women or do not recognize the majesty of their God-given roles, honor temporal success more than spiritual, or teach that reliance upon God is a weakness of character, all lead us away from eternal truths.\nOf all the traditions we should cultivate within ourselves and our families, a \u201ctradition of righteousness\u201d should be preeminent. Hallmarks of this tradition are an unwavering love for God and His Only Begotten Son, respect for prophets and priesthood power, a constant seeking of the Holy Spirit, and the discipline of discipleship which transforms believing into doing. A tradition of righteousness sets a pattern for living which draws children closer to parents, and both closer to God, and elevates obedience from a burden to a blessing.\nIn a world where traditions often confuse right and wrong:\nWe are inspired by the courage of each young person who has honored the Sabbath day, kept the Word of Wisdom, and remained chaste when popular culture has established the opposite as not only acceptable but expected.\nWe are inspired by the wisdom of each man who has molded a career which properly supports his premier responsibility to spiritually lead his family when wealth and power are more highly valued by the world.\nWe are inspired by the nobility of each husband and wife who have established a relationship of equality and kindness when one of selfishness and indifference is so common.\nAs the supernal nature of our life begins to be understood and experienced, we desire nothing temporal to impede our celestial journey.\nHumbled by the responsibility but joyous in the opportunity to preach the gospel and bear witness in all the world, I affirm my knowledge of eternal truths and everlasting culture. I testify of 15 men with prophetic calling and apostolic authority and one among them, even President Gordon B. Hinckley, who presides with dignity, vision, and a clear sense of righteous tradition. Of most significance, I testify of the Savior and Redeemer of mankind, of His Church, and of His atoning love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nDonald L. Hallstrom\nCultivate Righteous Traditions\n2000\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "\u201cHappiness,\u201d in the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, \u201cis the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it.\u201d (History of the Church, 5:134.) Often that path includes affliction, trials, and suffering\u2014physically, mentally, and even spiritually.\nAdversity, or what we perceive to be adversity, enters into the life of every individual at various times and in various forms. Adversity may be the consequence of willful disobedience to the laws of God. However, my remarks are directed to those who with righteous desire seek earnestly to learn and strive diligently to do God\u2019s will, yet nevertheless experience adversity. Much about this subject we do not understand, but let us consider some of what the Lord has revealed.\nAdversity in the lives of the obedient and faithful may be the consequence of disease, accidental injury, ignorance, or the influence of the adversary. To preserve free agency, the Lord also at times permits the righteous to suffer the consequences of evil acts by others. (See 1 Ne. 18:16.)\nSome may respond to such innocent suffering with resentment, anger, bitterness, doubt, or fear. (See 1 Ne. 17:20.) Others, with a knowledge and testimony of the divine plan of salvation, often respond with faith, patience, and hope born of that \u201cpeace \u2026 which passeth all understanding.\u201d (Philip. 4:6\u20137.)\nThe plan of salvation presented to and accepted by us in our premortal state includes a probationary period on earth, during which we experience opposites, make choices, learn the consequences thereof, and prepare to return to the presence of God. Experiencing adversity is an essential part of the process. Knowing this, we elected to come into mortality. (See 2 Ne. 2:11\u201316.)\nThe Savior himself \u201clearned \u2026 obedience by the things which he suffered.\u201d (Heb. 5:8.) Prophets and Apostles, ancient and modern, have struggled with adversity in their own lives, as well as with trials associated with their divine callings. No one is exempt.\nHowever, Paul teaches \u201cthat all things work together for good to them that love God.\u201d (Rom. 8:28.) Similarly, the prophet Lehi assured his son Jacob with these words: \u201cJacob, \u2026 in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow because of [others].\n\u201cNevertheless, \u2026 thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.\u201d (2 Ne. 2:1\u20132.)\nHow, then, shall we respond to undeserved adversity in our own lives? How may our responses to affliction and suffering draw us closer to the Savior, to our Heavenly Father, and to the realization of our own celestial potential? May I suggest some examples and role models found in the scriptures.\nThe sons of Mosiah, in the course of their missionary labors, \u201chad many afflictions \u2026 both in body and in mind \u2026 and also much labor in the spirit.\u201d (Alma 17:5.) Partly because of such experiences, they became \u201cstrong in the knowledge of the truth; \u2026 men of a sound understanding \u2026 [who] searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. \u2026\n\u201cThey had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation.\u201d (Alma 17:2\u20133.) Through their positive response to adversity, they grew spiritually.\nIn the time of Nephi, son of Helaman, \u201cthe more humble part of the people \u2026 [suffered] much affliction\u201d; but they fasted and prayed frequently and became \u201cstronger in their humility, and \u2026 firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation.\u201d (Hel. 3:34\u201335.)\nFrom their example, we learn some positive responses to our own undeserved adversity.\nAs they did, we should look to the Savior for divine assistance. Paul reminds us that \u201cwe have a great high priest, \u2026 Jesus the Son of God, \u2026 [who is] touched with the feeling of our infirmities.\u201d We are invited to seek his \u201chelp in time of need.\u201d (Heb. 4:14\u201316.)\nBecause the Savior suffered \u201cpains and afflictions and temptations of every kind \u2026 [taking] upon him the pains and the sickness of his people \u2026 [taking] upon him their infirmities \u2026 [he knows] according to the flesh how to [help] his people according to their infirmities.\u201d (Alma 7:11\u201312.) Therefore, we should follow the counsel of Amulek: \u201cLet your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.\u201d (Alma 34:27.)\nNext, our prayers should be accompanied with daily scripture study. The eternal perspective attained thereby reminds us of who we are, what the true purpose of this mortal experience is, and who placed us here. The availability of divine help is repeatedly reconfirmed. Daily scripture study also makes us continuously conscious of covenants we have made with the Lord and of his promised blessings.\nAs we fulfill our baptismal covenant, we \u201cbear one another\u2019s burdens, that they may be light,\u201d and our own burdens are lightened. We \u201ccomfort those that stand in need of comfort,\u201d and we receive comfort. When we \u201cstand as witnesses of God \u2026 in all things,\u201d we feel his redeeming love and see our present circumstances more clearly in the perspective of eternal life. (Mosiah 18:8\u20139.) In a sense, we are thereby accepting the Savior\u2019s invitation: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d (Matt. 11:28\u201330.) Is it not probable that bearing his yoke and his burden includes forgetting self in service to others?\nPatience must also be part of our response to adversity. Ammon, son of Mosiah, recalling personal challenges, acknowledged, \u201cNow when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back [or, in other words, give up], \u2026 the Lord comforted us, and said: \u2026 bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.\u201d (Alma 26:27.)\nIn our day, the Lord has counseled, \u201cFear not, let your hearts be comforted; \u2026 rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;\n\u201cWaiting patiently on the Lord. \u2026\n\u201cAnd all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good.\u201d (D&C 98:1\u20133.)\nRepeated assurances have been given regarding the benefits and blessings of positive responses to adversity, however undeserved. The witness of the Spirit and the manifestation of greater things often follow the trial of one\u2019s faith. (See Ether 12:6; 3 Ne. 26:7\u20139.) Spiritual refinement may be realized in the furnace of affliction. (1 Ne. 20:10.) Thereby we may be prepared to experience personal and direct contact with God.\nIn modern revelation we are instructed, \u201cSanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.\u201d (D&C 88:68.) Ancient prophets teach us that \u201cwhen he shall appear, \u2026 we shall see him as he is; \u2026 [and] be purified even as he is pure.\u201d (Moro. 7:48; see also 1 Jn. 3:2.)\nThe Lord\u2019s own way of preparing us to see him as he is may well include the refining furnace of affliction, that we may \u201coffer a sacrifice [to him] \u2026 of a broken heart and a contrite spirit,\u201d the promised reward being \u201cpeace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d (D&C 59:8, 23.)\nEach of us is the spiritual offspring of God. We came to this earth to prepare to return to his presence, there to share a fulness\u2014that is, eternal life. Without adversity, we may tend to forget the divine purpose of mortality and live our lives focused on the transitory things of the world.\nShould we therefore desire or seek to experience adversity and suffering? No! May we appropriately try to avoid it? Yes! Is it proper to ask for relief? Yes, always adding, in accordance with the Savior\u2019s example, \u201cnevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\u201d (Matt. 26:39.)\nThere are encouragement and comfort in knowing that we will not be tested beyond our capacity to endure, that we will benefit from our adversities, and that the resources and circumstances necessary for us to do so will be provided. (See 1 Cor. 10:13.) From the Book of Mormon comes another illustration:\nThose with whom Alma shared the inspired teachings of Abinadi entered into the baptismal covenant and began to live the gospel fully. There was no contention among them; they were knit together in unity and in love one toward another, caring for the poor and needy and for one another temporally and spiritually. Because of their industry and the harmony among them, they prospered. (See Mosiah 23:15\u201320.) Certainly they did not deserve adversity. However, they were provided with the opportunity for further spiritual growth.\nThe scriptural account continues with these words: \u201cNevertheless, the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.\u201d (Mosiah 23:21.) Notwithstanding their righteousness, these faithful people suffered much affliction. Understandably, they pleaded with the Lord for relief, perhaps hoping that the burdens would be removed. In response to their pleadings, the Lord comforted them and assured them of his help. (Mosiah 24:8\u201314.) Then he strengthened them \u201cthat they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.\u201d (Mosiah 24:15.) Eventually, because of their faith and patience, they were delivered from their afflictions. Having been further refined spiritually, and with increased faith, \u201cthey gave thanks to God.\u201d (Mosiah 24:16\u201322.)\nIn the final days of the Nephite civilization, the prophet Mormon wrote a letter to his son, Moroni, describing the wickedness, cruelty, and depravity which caused innocent people to suffer. Then he added these words of admonition and comfort:\n\u201cMy son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down \u2026 ; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, \u2026 his mercy \u2026 and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.\n\u201cAnd may the grace of God the Father \u2026 and our Lord Jesus Christ \u2026 be, and abide with you forever\u201d (Moro. 9:25\u201326), which is also my prayer for each of us, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRonald E. Poelman\nAdversity and the Divine Purpose of Mortality\n1989\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Since I last addressed the priesthood of the Church, some very basic changes in the responsibility of the Presiding Bishopric have taken place. The First Presidency has announced that the responsibility for all youth programs rests with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and has given much of the temporal responsibility of the Church to the Presiding Bishopric. We as a Bishopric have enjoyed greatly our association with youth throughout the world, as well as with our associates in the Aaronic Priesthood and Young Women at headquarters. The fact that this change has taken place does not lessen our interest in or love for youth. We continue to feel that the youth of today are a royal generation with a great destiny and pray for the well-being and success of young people everywhere.\nWe continue to serve in the Aaronic Priesthood as it pertains to the temporal affairs of the kingdom. Within the past six weeks, I with one of my counselors have traveled to every area of the Church outside the United States and Canada presided over by a General Authority Area Supervisor. As we have become more intimately acquainted with the rapid growth of the Church in many countries, resulting in stress and strain on the temporal organization of the Church and its physical resources, we can clearly see why the Lord inspired his prophet to make the organizational changes he has in recent months.\nI believe herein lies one of the most important and basic principles we should all be aware of. This lesson is taught by the Savior as recorded in Matt. 16:13\u201318:\n\u201cWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n\u201cAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\n\u201cHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?\n\u201cAnd Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n\u201cAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\n\u201cAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock [the rock of revelation] I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\u201d\nThe priesthood we bear and the Church we belong to today are the same as in the beginning. They were restored by revelation to a prophet\u2014Joseph Smith\u2014and are led by a prophet today\u2014President Spencer W. Kimball. This I know to be true. I am so grateful for this knowledge.\nAll of the changes that have taken place during President Kimball\u2019s ministry are the result of revelation, the same revelation the Savior referred to as the foundation stone of his church. With all my heart I, with my counselors, accept President Kimball as a prophet of God and accept his direction in all things, not only willingly but enthusiastically; and we encourage all faithful members of the Church to do likewise.\nPresident Lee on several occasions gave wise counsel with respect to following the living prophet. I should like to quote from one of his Brigham Young University devotional addresses:\n\u201cNow may I make a personal reference, which I\u2019ll try to treat in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality. It involved a beautiful, young wife and mother from a prominent family. She had gone away from her home and was now in the East. She had gone out into an area where she and her husband had taken up with those in the ghetto, and she wrote me a rather interesting letter, and I quote only a paragraph: \u2018Tomorrow my husband will shave off his long, full beard. Because of the request of the stake president and your direction in the Priesthood Bulletin, he must not have the appearance of evil or rebellion if he is to get a recommend to go to the temple. I have wept anguished tears; the faces of Moses and Jacob were bearded, and to me the wisdom and spirituality of the old prophets reflected from the face of my own spiritual husband. It was like cutting out for me a symbol of the good things my generation has learned.\u2019 Then the letter concluded with a challenge to me: \u2018We are prepared for clear, specific, hard-line direction as youth. Wishy-washy implications are not heard very well here. We look to you to tell it straight.\u2019\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she knew just what she was asking for when she asked me to tell it straight, but these are some things I wrote to her: \u2018In your letter you address me as, \u201cDear President Lee,\u201d and in your first sentence you refer to me as the Lord\u2019s prophet. Now, in your letter you tell me that you are saddened because with the shaving off of the beard and the cutting of the hair, which, to you, made your husband appear as the prophets Moses and Jacob, he would no longer bear that resemblance. I wonder if you might not be wiser to think of following the appearance of the prophets of today. President David O. McKay had no beard or long hair; neither did President Joseph Fielding Smith; and neither does your humble servant whom you have acknowledged as the Lord\u2019s prophet.\n\u201c\u2018The inconsistency in your letter has made me reflect upon an experience that I had in the mission field when, in company with some missionaries and the mission president, we were at Carthage Jail, where the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, took place. In that meeting there were recounted the events that led up to their martyrdom. Then the mission president made some significant comments. He said, \u201cWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith died there were many who died spiritually with Joseph.\u201d Likewise there were many who died spiritually with Brigham Young, and so with others of the presidents of the Church, because they chose to follow the man who had passed on, rather than giving allegiance to his successor upon whom the mantle of leadership had been given by the Lord\u2019s appointment.\u2019\n\u201cAnd then I asked her, \u2018Are you following, in looks, prophets who lived hundreds of years ago? Are you really true to your faith as a member of the Church in failing to look to those who preside in the Church today? Why is it that you want your husband to look like Moses and Jacob, rather than to look like the modern prophets to whom you are expressing allegiance? If you will give this sober thought, your tears will dry, and you\u2019ll begin to have some new thoughts.\u2019\u201d (\u201cBe Loyal to the Royal Within You.\u201d Speeches of the Year, Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1974, pp. 97\u201398.)\nAnother important lesson concerning following the direction of a living prophet can be found in 2 Kings, chapter 5. It tells of a great warrior and servant of the king of Syria whose name was Naaman. He had contracted leprosy. He was sent to the king of Israel, who later referred him to the prophet Elisha. We read in verses 9\u201314:\n\u201cSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.\n\u201cAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.\n\u201cBut Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.\n\u201cAre not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.\n\u201cAnd his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?\n\u201cThen went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\u201d [2 Kgs. 5:9\u201314]\nPresident Romney tells an interesting experience he had with regard to following the living prophet:\n\u201cOne day when President Grant was living, I sat in my office across the street following a general conference. A man came over to see me, an elderly man. He was very upset about what had been said in this conference by some of the Brethren, including myself. I could tell from his speech that he came from a foreign land. After I had quieted him enough so he would listen, I said, \u2018Why did you come to America?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I came here because a prophet of God told me to come.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Who was the prophet?\u2019 I continued.\n\u201c\u2018Wilford Woodruff.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Do you believe Wilford Woodruff was a prophet of God?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 said he.\n\u201c\u2018Do you believe that his successor, President Lorenzo Snow, was a prophet of God?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I do.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Do you believe that President Joseph F. Smith was a prophet of God?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\u201cThen came the \u2018sixty-four dollar question.\u2019 \u2018Do you believe that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God?\u2019\n\u201cHis answer: \u2018I think he ought to keep his mouth shut about old age assistance.\u2019\u201d (Conference Report, April 6, 1953, p. 125.)\nWhat a great blessing it is to live in this world and have ears with which to hear the direction from a living prophet of God\u2014direction that can bring inner peace in a time of great confusion and difficulty. I pray that each of us will listen to and follow President Kimball, who, I testify, is the mouthpiece of the Lord to mankind today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nVictor L. Brown\nFollow the Living Prophet\n1977\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Recently I met an old friend I had not seen for some time. He greeted me with the salutation, \u201cHow is the world treating you?\u201d I don\u2019t recall the specifics of my reply, but his provocative question caused me to reflect on my many blessings and my gratitude for life itself and the privilege and opportunity to serve.\nAt times the response to this same question brings an unanticipated answer. Some years ago I attended a stake conference in Texas. I was met at the airport by the stake president, and while we were driving to the stake center, I said, \u201cPresident, how is everything going for you?\u201d\nHe responded, \u201cI wish you had asked me that question a week earlier, for this week has been rather eventful. On Friday I was terminated from my employment, this morning my wife came down with bronchitis, and this afternoon the family dog was struck and killed by a passing car. Other than these things, I guess everything is all right.\u201d\nLife is full of difficulties, some minor and others of a more serious nature. There seems to be an unending supply of challenges for one and all. Our problem is that we often expect instantaneous solutions to such challenges, forgetting that frequently the heavenly virtue of patience is required.\nThe counsel heard in our youth is still applicable today and should be heeded. \u201cHold your horses,\u201d \u201cKeep your shirt on,\u201d \u201cSlow down,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry,\u201d \u201cFollow the rules,\u201d \u201cBe careful\u201d are more than trite expressions. They describe sincere counsel and speak the wisdom of experience.\nThe mindless and reckless speeding of a youth-filled car down a winding and hazardous canyon road can bring a sudden loss of control, the careening of the car with its precious cargo over the precipice, and the downward plunge that ofttimes brings permanent incapacity, perhaps premature death, and grieving hearts of loved ones. The glee-filled moment can turn in an instant to a lifetime of regret.\nOh, precious youth, please give life a chance. Apply the virtue of patience.\nIn sickness, with its attendant pain, patience is required. If the only perfect man who ever lived\u2014even Jesus of Nazareth\u2014was called upon to endure great suffering, how can we, who are less than perfect, expect to be free of such challenges?\nWho can count the vast throngs of the lonely, the aged, the helpless\u2014those who feel abandoned by the caravan of life as it moves relentlessly onward and then disappears beyond the sight of those who ponder, who wonder, and who sometimes question as they are left alone with their thoughts. Patience can be a helpful companion during such stressful times.\nOccasionally I visit nursing homes, where long-suffering is found. While attending Sunday services at one facility, I noticed a young girl who was to play her violin for the comfort of those assembled. She told me she was nervous and hoped she could do her best. As she played, one called out, \u201cOh, you are so pretty, and you play so beautifully.\u201d The strains of the moving bow across the taut strings and the elegant movement of the young girl\u2019s fingers seemed inspired by the impromptu comment. She played magnificently.\nAfterward, I congratulated her and her gifted accompanist. They responded, \u201cWe came to cheer the frail, the sick, and the elderly. Our fears vanished as we played. We forgot our own cares and concerns. We may have cheered them, but they truly did inspire us.\u201d\nSometimes the tables are reversed. A dear and cherished young friend, Wendy Bennion of Salt Lake City, was such an example. Just the day before yesterday, she quietly departed mortality and returned \u201cto that God who gave [her] life\u201d (Alma 40:11). She had struggled for over five long years in her battle with cancer. Ever cheerful, always reaching out to help others, never losing faith, her contagious smile attracted others to her as a magnet attracts metal shavings. While ill and in pain, a friend of hers, feeling downcast with her own situation, visited Wendy. Nancy, Wendy\u2019s mother, knowing Wendy was in extreme pain, felt that perhaps the friend had stayed too long. She asked Wendy, after the friend had left, why she had allowed her to stay so long when she herself was in so much pain. Wendy\u2019s response: \u201cWhat I was doing for my friend was a lot more important than the pain I was having. If I can help her, then the pain is worth it.\u201d Her attitude was reminiscent of Him who bore the sorrows of the world, who patiently suffered excruciating pain and disappointment, but who, with silent step of His sandaled feet, passed by a man who was blind from birth, restoring his sight. He approached the grieving widow of Nain and raised her son from the dead. He trudged up Calvary\u2019s steep slope, carrying His own cruel cross, undistracted by the constant jeers and taunting that accompanied His every step. For He had an appointment with divine destiny. In a very real way He visits us, each one, with His teachings. He brings cheer and inspires goodness. He gave His precious life that the grave would be deprived of its victory, that death would lose its sting, that life eternal would be our gift.\nTaken from the cross, buried in a borrowed tomb, this man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, arose on the morning of the third day. His resurrection was discovered by Mary and the other Mary when they approached the tomb. The great stone blocking the entrance had been rolled away. Came the query of two angels who stood by in shining garments, \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.\u201d1\nPaul declared to the Hebrews, \u201cWherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.\u201d2\nPerhaps there has never occurred such a demonstration of patience as that exemplified by Job, who was described in the Holy Bible as being perfect and upright and one who feared God and eschewed evil.3 He was blessed with great wealth and riches in abundance. Satan obtained leave from the Lord to try to tempt Job. How great was Job\u2019s misery, how terrible his loss, how tortured his life. Urged by his wife to curse God and die, his reply bespoke his faith: \u201cI know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\u201d4 What faith, what courage, what trust. Job lost possessions\u2014all of them. Job lost his health\u2014all of it. Job honored the trust given him. Job personified patience.\nAnother who portrayed the virtue of patience was the Prophet Joseph Smith. After his supernal experience in the grove called Sacred, where the Father and the Son appeared to him, he was called upon to wait. At length, after Joseph suffered through over three years of derision for his beliefs, the angel Moroni appeared to him. And then more waiting and patience were required. Let us remember the counsel found in Isaiah: \u201cMy thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\u201d5\nToday in our hurried and hectic lives, we could well go back to an earlier time for the lesson taught us regarding crossing dangerous streets. \u201cStop, look, and listen\u201d were the watchwords. Could we not apply them now? Stop from a reckless road to ruin. Look upward for heavenly help. Listen for His invitation: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d6\nHe will teach us the truth of the beautiful verse:\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\nAnd the grave is not its goal;\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\nWas not spoken of the soul.7\nWe will learn that each of us is precious to our Elder Brother, even the Lord Jesus Christ. He truly loves us.\nHis life is the flawless example of one afflicted with sorrows and disappointments, who nonetheless provided the example of forgetting self and serving others. The remembered verse of childhood echoes afresh:\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nThe Bible tells me so!8\nAnd so does the Book of Mormon, so does the Doctrine and Covenants, and so does the Pearl of Great Price. Let the scriptures be your guide, and you will never find yourself traveling the road to nowhere.\nToday, some are out of work, out of money, out of self-confidence. Hunger haunts their lives, and discouragement dogs their paths. But help is here\u2014even food for the hungry, clothing for the naked, and shelter for the homeless.\nThousands of tons move outward from our Church storehouses weekly\u2014even food, clothing, medical equipment and supplies to the far corners of the earth and to empty cupboards and needy people closer to home.\nI witness the motivation which prompts busy and talented dentists and doctors on a regular basis to leave their practices and donate their skills to those who need such help. They travel to faraway places to repair cleft palates, correct malformed bones, and restore crippled bodies\u2014all for the love of God\u2019s children. The afflicted who have patiently waited for corrective help are blessed by these \u201cangels in disguise.\u201d\nIn the words of a well-known song, I wish you could \u201ccome fly with me\u201d to eastern Germany, where I visited last month. As we traveled along the autobahns, I reflected on a time twenty-seven years before when I saw on the same autobahns just trucks carrying armed soldiers and policemen. Barking dogs everywhere strained on their leashes, and informers walked the streets. Back then, the flame of freedom had flickered and burned low. A wall of shame sprang up, and a curtain of iron came down. Hope was all but snuffed out. Life, precious life, continued on in faith, nothing wavering. Patient waiting was required. An abiding trust in God marked the life of each Latter-day Saint.\nWhen I made my initial visit beyond the wall, it was a time of fear on the part of our members as they struggled in the performance of their duties. I found the dullness of despair on the faces of many passersby but a bright and beautiful expression of love emanating from our members. In G\u00f6rlitz the building in which we met was shell-pocked from the war, but the interior reflected the tender care of our leaders in bringing brightness and cleanliness to an otherwise shabby and grimy structure. The Church had survived both the war and the Cold War which followed. The singing of the Saints brightened every soul. They sang the old Sunday School favorite:\nIf the way be full of trial; Weary not!\nIf it\u2019s one of sore denial, Weary not!\nIf it now be one of weeping,\nThere will come a joyous greeting,\nWhen the harvest we are reaping\u2014Weary not!\nDo not weary by the way,\nWhatever be thy lot;\nThere awaits a brighter day\nTo all, to all who weary not!9\nI was touched by their sincerity. I was humbled by their poverty. They had so little. My heart filled with sorrow because they had no patriarch. They had no wards or stakes\u2014just branches. They could not receive temple blessings\u2014neither endowment nor sealing. No official visitor had come from Church headquarters in a long time. The members were forbidden to leave the country. Yet they trusted in the Lord with all their hearts, and they leaned not to their own understanding. In all their ways they acknowledged Him, and He directed their paths.10 I stood at the pulpit, and with tear-filled eyes and a voice choked with emotion, I made a promise to the people: \u201cIf you will remain true and faithful to the commandments of God, every blessing any member of the Church enjoys in any other country will be yours.\u201d\nThat night as I realized what I had promised, I dropped to my knees and prayed, \u201cHeavenly Father, I\u2019m on Thy errand; this is Thy church. I have spoken words that came not from me, but from Thee and Thy Son. Wilt Thou, therefore, fulfill the promise in the lives of this noble people.\u201d There coursed through my mind the words from the psalm, \u201cBe still, and know that I am God.\u201d11 The heavenly virtue of patience was required.\nLittle by little the promise was fulfilled. First, patriarchs were ordained, then lesson manuals produced. Wards were formed and stakes created. Chapels and stake centers were begun, completed, and dedicated. Then, miracle of miracles, a holy temple of God was permitted, designed, constructed, and dedicated. Finally, after an absence of fifty years, approval was granted for full-time missionaries to enter the nation and for local youth to serve elsewhere in the world. Then, like the wall of Jericho, the Berlin Wall crumbled, and freedom, with its attendant responsibilities, returned.\nAll of the parts of the precious promise of twenty-seven years earlier were fulfilled, save one. Tiny G\u00f6rlitz, where the promise had been given, still had no chapel of its own. Now, even that dream became a reality. The building was approved and completed. Dedication day dawned. Just a month ago, Sister Monson and I, along with Elder and Sister Dieter Uchtdorf, held a meeting of dedication in G\u00f6rlitz. The same songs were sung as were rendered twenty-seven years earlier. The members knew the significance of the occasion, marking the total fulfillment of the promise. They wept as they sang. The song of the righteous was indeed a prayer unto the Lord and had been answered with a blessing upon their heads.12\nAt the conclusion of the meeting we were reluctant to leave. As we did so, seen were the waving hands of all, heard were the words, \u201cAuf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen; God be with you till we meet again.\u201d\nPatience, that heavenly virtue, had brought to humble Saints its heaven-sent reward. The words of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cRecessional\u201d seemed so fitting:\nThe tumult and the shouting dies;\nThe captains and the kings depart.\nStill stands thine ancient sacrifice,\nAn humble and a contrite heart.\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\nLest we forget, lest we forget.13\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nPatience\u2014A Heavenly Virtue\n1995\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "The other day, as I overhead one neighbor criticizing another, I was reminded of these lines:\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t this old world be better\nIf the folks we meet would say:\n\u2018I know something good about you,\u2019\nAnd then treat us that way?\u201d\nThen I thought of the words of one of our hymns:\n\u201cLet each man learn to know himself;\nTo gain that knowledge let him labor,\nImprove those failings in himself\nWhich he condemns so in his neighbor.\nHow lenient our own faults we view,\nAnd conscience\u2019s voice adeptly smother;\nYet, oh, how harshly we review\nThe selfsame failings in another! \u2026\nSo first improve yourself today\nAnd then improve your friends tomorrow.\u201d\n\u2014Hymns, no. 91\nIt seems common practice for people to talk about their friends and neighbors and to criticize their seeming peculiarities and weaknesses. In fact, it is so general that one would think that gossiping about and judging others was the thing to do. How often have we heard of young men who were criticized, judged, and ridiculed because of their peculiarities and yet who eventually became leaders in their different fields of endeavor.\nLet me give you one or two examples of unjust criticism and judging without the facts.\nThere is a little story about Sister McKay, the wife of President David O. McKay, when she began teaching school. As the principal introduced her to the class, he pointed to a certain boy and said he was a troublemaker. She sensed the boy\u2019s embarrassment and feared he would live up to his reputation, so she wrote a note and slipped it to him as she passed his desk. It said, \u201cEarl, I think the principal was mistaken about your being a bad boy. I trust you, and know that you are going to help me make this room the best in the school.\u201d Earl not only became a paragon of scholastic virtue but also one of the town\u2019s most important people.\nI should like to give you another example. One of our most respected community-minded citizens began to act as though his feelings had been hurt and to stay away from socials where, in the past, he had gone and taken a most active part. People started accusing him of being a sorehead, a poor sport, antisocial, etc., and even evaded him whenever possible. Later, a medical diagnosis showed he was suffering from a brain tumor, which had been the cause of his lack of interest in activities that he had previously attended and even sponsored.\nLet me give you another example or two of what I would call unrighteous judgment. First, a bishop who needs additional officers sees a member of his ward who, though not active, seems to have ability, but he says to himself, \u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t be interested. He wouldn\u2019t want to accept a position.\u201d So he does not approach him, and the man remains inactive for years.\nA new bishop is called to the ward, asks the man if he would be willing to accept a position, and finds that he is really ready and anxious to work.\nDon\u2019t prejudge, but give the person an opportunity. Let him decide for himself to accept or decline.\nOn the other hand, we hear a man say to his family and to others, \u201cI don\u2019t see why the bishop does this or that. You would think he would know better.\u201d Here he is judging the bishop without the facts, which, if known to him, would be full justification for the action taken. The man\u2019s judgment was not only unrighteous, but it had probably prejudiced his children and caused them to lose respect for the bishop and had weakened their faith.\nThese examples show how important it is that we do not judge, but encourage rather than denounce. Jesus Christ, some 2,000 years ago, realizing man\u2019s tendency to make unrighteous judgment, said:\n\u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged.\n\u201cFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\u201cAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n\u201cOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\n\u201cThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u2019s eye.\u201d (Matt. 7:1\u20135.)\nIt seems he is saying that unless we are without fault, we are not qualified to judge. By referring to Samuel\u2019s experience while choosing a king, we may get a better understanding of the fact that man is not qualified to judge. The Lord had rejected Saul as king of Israel and instructed the prophet Samuel to choose a new king. He told him to go to the house of Jesse, who had eight sons, and that while there the anointed one would pass before him and Samuel would know who was to be chosen. When the first son, Eliab, came before him, Samuel thought he was the chosen one, but the Lord refused him and then gave the prophet Samuel the key as to how to judge:\n\u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7.)\nEach of the seven sons then passed before Samuel and was rejected. Then David, the youngest, was sent for and was approved by the Lord.\nThe reason, therefore, that we cannot judge is obvious. We cannot see what is in the heart. We do not know motives, although we impute motives to every action we see. They may be pure while we think they are improper.\nIt is not possible to judge another fairly unless you know his desires, his faith, and his goals. Because of a different environment, unequal opportunity, and many other things, people are not in the same position. One may start at the top and the other at the bottom, and they may meet as they are going in opposite directions. Someone has said that it is not where you are but the direction in which you are going that counts; not how close you are to failure or success but which way you are headed. How can we, with all our weaknesses and frailties, dare to arrogate to ourselves the position of a judge? At best, man can judge only what he sees; he cannot judge the heart or the intention, or begin to judge the potential of his neighbor.\nWhen we try to judge people, which we should not do, we have a great tendency to look for and take pride in finding weaknesses and faults, such as vanity, dishonesty, immorality, and intrigue. As a result, we see only the worst side of those being judged.\nOur news media today also seem to be interested mainly in controversial subjects or someone who is being attacked; and regardless of the ninety-nine good things one may do, it is the one weakness or error that alone is emphasized and heralded to the world.\nWe are too prone to listen to, accept, and repeat such adverse criticism, such maliciously spoken or printed words, without stopping to realize the harm we may be doing to some noble person; and, as is done so often, we excuse and justify ourselves by saying, \u201cWell, where there is so much smoke, there must be some fire,\u201d whereas in reality we are adding to the smoke, when the fire referred to may be only the fire of malice started by some envious person.\nSometimes even when our friends are accused of wrongdoing or gossip is started about them, we disloyally accept and repeat what we hear without knowing all the facts. It is sad indeed that sometimes friendships are destroyed and enmity created on the basis of misinformation.\nIf there be one place in life where the attitude of the agnostic is acceptable, it is in this matter of judging. It is the courage to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I am waiting for further evidence. I must hear both sides of the question.\u201d\nOnly by suspending judgment do we exhibit real charity. It is hard to understand why we are ready to condemn our neighbors and our friends on circumstantial evidence while we are all so determined to see that every criminal has a fair and open trial. Surely we can try to eliminate pride, passion, personal feeling, prejudice, and pettiness from our minds, and show charity to those around us.\nLet us look for the good rather than try to discover any hidden evil. We can easily find fault in others if that is what we are looking for. Even in families, divorce has resulted and families have been broken up because the husband or wife was looking for and emphasizing the faults rather than loving and extolling the virtues of the other.\nLet us remember too that the further out of line or out of tune we ourselves are, the more we are inclined to look for error or weaknesses in others and to try to rationalize and justify our own faults rather than to try to improve ourselves. Almost invariably, we find that the greatest criticism of Church leaders and doctrine comes from those who are not doing their full duty, following the leaders, or living according to the teachings of the gospel.\nAn outstanding example of this can be found in the story of Cain and Abel. Cain neglected his own stewardship and became so bitter over Abel\u2019s righteousness and favor in the eyes of the Lord that his insane jealousy caused him to murder his brother. How much better would his situation have been had he congratulated and honored his brother and set about to improve himself and correct his own failings.\nLet us examine our own lives and actions, bring ourselves in tune with righteous principles, and never attack or spread misinformation about others.\nGossip is the worst form of judging. The tongue is the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly weapon available to man. A vicious tongue can ruin the reputation and even the future of the one attacked. Insidious attacks against one\u2019s reputation, loathsome innuendoes, half-lies about an individual are as deadly as those insect parasites that kill the heart and life of a mighty oak. They are so stealthy and cowardly that one cannot guard against them. As someone has said, \u201cIt is easier to dodge an elephant than a microbe.\u201d\nWhat a different world it would be if we would put into practice what we have all heard so many times: \u201c\u2026 whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u201d (Matt. 7:12.) Instead, we are all so inclined to judge others by a standard different from the one by which we would wish or be willing to be judged.\nWhen the woman accused of adultery was brought before Christ, he was indignant because of the accusers\u2019 injustice. They were wanting the woman to be judged on the basis of standards different from those by which they were willing to be judged and on a matter of which some were guilty.\nHe said: \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d Then, after stooping and writing in the sand, he looked up and said, \u201c\u2026 where are those thine accusers?\u201d (John 8:7, 10.)\nIf Jesus were to stand by and be asked to judge those whom we accuse and should say to us, \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her,\u201d and then should stoop and write in the sand, how many of us would feel to steal away ashamed, convicted in our own conscience? How sound is his counsel!\nIf we could accept and practice the second great commandment, \u201cThou shall love thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (Matt. 22:39), and really learn to love our neighbors, there would be no vicious gossip or bearing false witness. In the Lord\u2019s prayer, we have these words: \u201cAnd forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\u201d and then he says: \u201cFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d (Matt. 6:12, 14\u201315.)\nChrist is our greatest example of forgiveness. To the woman brought before him accused of adultery, he said, \u201cNeither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\u201d (John 8:11.)\nThen on the cross he prayed: \u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\u201d (Luke 23:34.)\nRegardless of our ego, our pride, or our feeling of insecurity, our lives would be happier, we would be contributing more to social welfare and the happiness of others, if we would love one another, forgive one another, repent of our wrongdoings, and judge not.\nIt is true that we must have appointed judges to deal with the laws of the land and judges in the Church to deal with its members; and they are given the heavy duty and responsibility of judging, which they must not neglect, but they must give righteous judgment according to the law of the land and of the Church.\nThis being election year, there will be much campaigning; we will hear and argue the pros and cons of many questions; we will have strong opposing views. Each must try to understand the questions and then stand firm by his convictions. But let us determine now that in the heat of the campaign we will not indulge in the vituperative talk of personalities that we so often hear. We must not rail against our brother and accuse him of lying and cheating or being dishonest or immoral.\nLet us stand on principle\u2014high principle. Also, it is most important that all of us, including our politicians, strive to live so that our actions will be above reproach and criticism.\nWe never gain anything or improve our own character by trying to tear down another. We have seen close friendships destroyed through words spoken and accusations made in the heat of a campaign. Tirades against men in office or against one\u2019s opponent tend to cause our youth and others to lose faith in the individual and others in government and often even our form of government itself.\nAs parents, we have the responsibility in our homes to guard against any of these things. Also, we must realize that every word and every act influences the thinking and attitude of the child. It is in the family that the child picks up the elementary lessons in getting along with people and the virtues of love, compassion, and concern. These lessons will have been well taught if parents can bring up their children without prejudicing them by precept or example against any other children on the grounds of color, race, religion, social status, or intellectual capacity, and if they teach them to love the Lord. I am so thankful that my parents, through their tolerance, were able to accomplish this with their children.\nMay I humbly say in all sincerity that I love the Lord with all my heart and that I love my fellowmen. I hold no hard feelings of any kind toward any man, and I sincerely pray for forgiveness wherein I have offended anyone. I realize, as the Savior said, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (Matt. 25:40.)\nTo all the world, and especially to those who do not understand but who ridicule the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I wish to bear my witness and issue a challenge that you judge not until you know and understand those teachings which are contained in the restored gospel. We believe, with you, that God lives and that Jesus Christ is his Only, but truly, Begotten Son in the flesh, who came and gave his life and was resurrected so that all mankind might enjoy immortality.\nHe said, \u201c\u2026 this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (Moses 1:39), and he gave us the gospel plan by which we can prepare ourselves to go back into his presence and enjoy eternal life.\nYes, the gospel in its fullness is restored and is here upon the earth today. I bear witness that the Bible is the word of God, given to us through his prophets, and also that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is a translated and true record of God\u2019s dealings with the ancient American people, containing the gospel in its fullness. It was written by way of commandment and also by the spirit of prophecy and by revelation, to the convincing of the Jew and the gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.\nI also wish to bear testimony that I know that Joseph Fielding Smith, the President of the Church, is a prophet of God through whom the Lord speaks, and I express my sincere and deep appreciation for the opportunity I have of working so closely with him.\nThese things I know, and I humbly bear my testimony that they are true; and I invite and encourage each and every one of you to investigate and to read the Book of Mormon, to test and enjoy the promise contained therein, which is:\n\u201cAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\n\u201cAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\u201d (Moro. 10:4\u20135.)\nThis promise, and my testimony, I leave with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nN. Eldon Tanner\n\u201cJudge Not, That Ye Be Not Judged\u201d\n1972\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I have had the great blessing of serving among the Saints of the Pacific for most of my adult life. The faith, love, and amazing sacrifices of these devoted Saints fill me with inspiration, gratitude, and joy. Their stories are like your own.\nIt has occurred to me that these Saints have much in common with the widow whom the Savior observed while He \u201csat \u2026 and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.\n\u201cAnd there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites.\u00a0\u2026\n\u201cAnd he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:\n\u201cFor \u2026 they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.\u201d1\nEven though her two mites were a meager contribution, to the Savior her gift was of supreme value, because she gave everything. In that moment, the Savior fully knew the widow, for her gift showed Him her heart. The quality and depth of her love and faith were such that she gave knowing that her \u201cwant\u201d would be supplied.\nI have seen that same heart in the Saints of the Pacific. In a small village on one of these islands, an older man and his wife accepted the invitation of the missionaries to sincerely ask the Lord if the lessons they were being taught were true. In this process, they also considered the consequences of the commitments that they would need to make if the answer that they received led to their accepting the restored gospel. They fasted and prayed to know the truthfulness of the Church and the veracity of the Book of Mormon. The answer to their prayers came in the form of a sweet but ringing affirmation: \u201cYes! It is true!\u201d\nHaving received this witness, they chose to be baptized. This was not a choice without personal cost. Their decision and baptism carried with them a high price. They lost employment, they sacrificed social standing, important friendships dissolved, and the support, love, and respect of family were withdrawn. They now walked to church each Sunday, exchanging awkward glances with friends and neighbors who were walking in the opposite direction.\nIn these difficult circumstances, this good brother was asked how he felt about their decision to join the Church. His simple and unwavering reply was \u201cIt is true, isn\u2019t it? Our choice was clear.\u201d\nThese two newly converted Saints truly had the heart of the widow. They, like the widow, \u201ccast in all\u201d that they could give, knowingly giving of their \u201cwant.\u201d As a product of their believing hearts and enduring faith during those hard times, their burdens were lightened. They were aided and surrounded by supportive and ministering Church members, and they were personally strengthened by their service in Church callings.\nAfter they cast in their \u201call,\u201d the greatest day came when they were sealed in the temple as an eternal family. Like He did the converts under Alma\u2019s leadership, \u201cthe Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.\u201d2 Such is the heart of the widow exemplified in this wonderful couple.\nLet me speak of another experience where the heart of the widow was in full view. In Samoa, we labor with village councils to gain access for missionaries to preach the gospel. A few years ago, I had a conversation with a chief from a village where the missionaries had been prohibited for many, many years. My conversation occurred not too long after the paramount chief had opened the village to the Church, permitting our missionaries to teach those interested in learning about the gospel and its doctrines.\nAfter so many years, to have this miraculous turn of events, I was curious to learn about what had happened to cause the paramount chief to take this action. I asked about this, and the chief with whom I was conversing replied, \u201cA man can live in the dark for a period, but there will come a time when he will long to come into the light.\u201d\nThe paramount chief, in opening the village, demonstrated the heart of the widow\u2014a heart that softens when the warmth and light of the truth is revealed. This leader was willing to relinquish years of tradition, confront much opposition, and stand firm so that others might be blessed. This was a leader whose heart was focused on the welfare and happiness of his people rather than on considerations of tradition, culture, and personal power. He gave away those concerns in favor of what President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has taught us: \u201cAs we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light in the lives of others.\u201d3\nFinally, let me share with you one more experience among the Saints of the Pacific that remains deeply and spiritually rooted in my soul. Some years ago I was a young counselor to a bishop in a new ward in American Samoa. We had 99 members, consisting of subsistence farmers, cannery workers, government employees, and their families. When the First Presidency announced in 1977 that a temple was going to be constructed in Samoa, there was joy and thanksgiving expressed by all of us. Going to the temple from American Samoa at that time required traveling either to Hawaii or New Zealand. This was a costly journey that was beyond the reach of many faithful Church members.\nDuring this period of time members were encouraged to donate to a building fund to assist in the construction of temples. In this spirit, our bishopric asked the ward members to prayerfully consider what they could give. A date was set for families to gather to offer their donations. Later, as these donations were opened in private, our bishopric was humbled and touched by the faith and generosity of our wonderful ward members.\nKnowing each family and their circumstances, I felt a deep and abiding sense of awe, respect, and humility. These were, in every way, modern-day widow\u2019s mites given freely from their \u201cwant,\u201d with a joy in the promised blessing of the construction of a holy temple of the Lord in Samoa. These families had consecrated all that they could to the Lord, with the faith that they would not be left wanting. Their gift manifested their widow\u2019s hearts. All who gave did so willingly and joyfully because the widow\u2019s heart within them could see with the eye of faith the great crowning blessings in store for their families and for all of the people of Samoa and American Samoa for generations to come. I know that their consecrated offerings, their widow\u2019s mites, were known and accepted by the Lord.\nThe heart of the widow who gave her two mites is a heart that will give all by making sacrifices; by enduring hardship, persecution, and rejection; and by bearing burdens of many kinds. The heart of the widow is a heart that senses, feels, and knows the light of truth and will give anything to embrace that truth. It also helps others to see that same light and come to the same measure of eternal happiness and joy. Finally, the heart of the widow is defined by a willingness to give all for building up the kingdom of God on the earth.\nLet us join as worldwide Saints in doing that which is necessary to have the widow\u2019s heart, truly rejoicing in the blessings that will fill the \u201cwant\u201d that results. My prayer for each of us is a plea to have the heart to bear our burdens, make necessary sacrifices, and have the will to do and to give. I promise that the Lord will not leave you wanting. The heart of the widow is filled with thanksgiving that the Savior was \u201ca man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief\u201d4 so that we would not need to taste the \u201cbitter cup.\u201d5 In spite of our weaknesses and failings, and because of them, He continues to offer His hands, which were pierced for our sakes. He will lift us up if we are willing to come into the light of His gospel, embrace Him, and allow Him to fill our \u201cwant.\u201d\nI bear my testimony of the great love that we can share as disciples and followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I love and sustain President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson as the prophet of God on the earth. The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ to the world, and I invite all to read it and discover its message for you. All who accept the Lord\u2019s invitation to come unto Him will find peace, love, and light. Jesus Christ is our great Exemplar and Redeemer. It is only through Jesus Christ, and the miracle of His infinite Atonement, that we can receive eternal life. Of this I bear witness in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Elder O.\u00a0Vincent Haleck\nThe Heart of the Widow\n2017\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "The Return of Oliver Cowdery\nScott H. Faulring\nOn Sunday, 12 November 1848, apostle Orson Hyde, president of the Quorum of the Twelve and the church\u2019s\npresiding of cial at Kanesville-Council Bluffs, stepped into the cool waters of Mosquito Creek 1 near Council\nBluffs, Iowa, and took Mormonism\u2019s estranged Second Elder by the hand to rebaptize him. Sometime shortly after\nthat, Elder Hyde laid hands on Oliver\u2019s head, con rming him back into church membership and reordaining him an\nelder in the Melchizedek Priesthood. 2 Cowdery\u2019s rebaptism culminated six years of desire on his part and\nprotracted efforts encouraged by the Mormon leadership to bring about his sought-after, eagerly anticipated\nreconciliation. Cowdery, renowned as one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, corecipient of restored\npriesthood power, and a founding member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had spent ten and a\nhalf years outside the church after his April 1838 excommunication.\nOliver Cowdery wanted reaf liation with the church he helped organize. His penitent yearnings to reassociate\nwith the Saints were evident from his personal letters and actions as early as 1842. Oliver understood the\nnecessity of rebaptism. By subjecting himself to rebaptism by Elder Hyde, Cowdery acknowledged the priesthood\nkeys and authority held by the First Presidency under Brigham Young and the Twelve.\nOliver Cowdery\u2019s tenure as Second Elder and Associate President ended abruptly when he decided not to appear\nand defend himself against misconduct charges at the 12 April 1838, Far West, Missouri, high council hearing. 3\nInstead, Oliver sent a terse letter in which he elaborated on his differences of opinion \u201con some Church\nregulations.\u201d In this defensive communiqu\u00e9, Oliver implored Bishop Edward Partridge and the council to \u201ctake no\nview of the foregoing remarks, other than my belief on the outward government of this Church.\u201d 4 President\nCowdery regretted that differences existed, but he explained that he was not willing to be dictated to in his\ntemporal business affairs or have his civil liberties abused by those who, he believed, were aspiring for position.\nThe Far West High Council, unsympathetic to Oliver Cowdery\u2019s views, sustained six of the nine charges against\nhim, and he was promptly excommunicated. 5 That his disparities were mainly bureaucratic versus theocratic is\nsupported by Thomas B. Marsh\u2019s chance meeting of Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer later that summer.\nMarsh, by then himself a defector from the Mormon fold, asked the two witnesses if they still held to the beliefs as\nproclaimed in their published Book of Mormon testimony. Marsh recalled that both David and Oliver answered\nemphatically, \u201cYes.\u201d 6\nThe rst encouraging news about Oliver Cowdery after his disaffection came to Nauvoo in a letter written to\nJoseph Smith from an unidenti ed church member in Kirtland. Laura Pitkin, a resident of Nauvoo, shared news\ngleaned from this Kirtland letter in the postscript of her letter to Heber C. Kimball. Pitkin observed: \u201cBrother\nJoseph received a letter from Kirtland last week. Martin Harris has come [back] into the church. Oliver Cowd[e]ry\nis very friendly and they have properous times in that place.\u201d 7\nNo of cial action was taken to replace Oliver Cowdery as Associate President until 24 January 1841. In Joseph\nSmith\u2019s rst public revelation after being liberated from his Missouri imprisonment, reasons for a reorganization\nwere explained, required in part because of the expulsion of Oliver Cowdery. Hyrum Smith, the Prophet\u2019s older\nbrother, was called to ll the of ce of church patriarch, replacing Father Smith, who had died four months earlier.\nIn addition, Hyrum was called to ll the vacancy left by Cowdery as Associate President and given the \u201csame\nblessing, and glory, and honor, and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood\u201d once held by Cowdery (D&C 124:95).Since Oliver had defected and isolated himself from the church, it is presumed that he was not noti ed of the\nchange.\nAfter leaving Missouri in the fall of 1838, Oliver Cowdery returned to Kirtland, settling close to his non-Mormon\nbrother, Lyman. In early 1840, Oliver was admitted to the Ohio bar as an attorney. He practiced law in Kirtland\nwith Lyman for a short time. Cowdery moved in the fall of 1840 to Tif n, a town in northwestern Ohio, where he\ncontinued as a lawyer. 8 For the next seven years, Tif n was Cowdery\u2019s home.\nBy December 1842, four and a half years after he had been excommunicated, Cowdery was visited at least three\ntimes by his devoted friend and brother-in-law Phineas H. Young. Phineas, who had been away from Nauvoo for\nve months, was accompanied by Franklin D. Richards and had been sent to Cincinnati to preside over the church\nin the southern district of Ohio. 9 While laboring in Ohio, Phineas called on Oliver. It is unclear whether Elder\nYoung was speci cally directed by church leaders to contact Oliver Cowdery or whether he did so on his own\ninitiative. Nonetheless, these visits were the rst steps taken to redeem Cowdery from estrangement. Phineas,\nmarried to Oliver\u2019s half-sister Lucy, started the momentum that would, six years later, result in Oliver\u2019s\nreinstatement. Reporting that Oliver was alive and well, Phineas wrote his brother Brigham and the Twelve\ninforming them that Oliver\u2019s \u201cheart is still with his old friends.\u201d 10\nPhineas expressed his conviction that the disenfranchised Second Elder would willingly gather with the Saints in\nNauvoo if only Brother Joseph understood Oliver\u2019s side of the controversy that led to his (Cowdery\u2019s) dismissal\nfrom Far West. Always Oliver\u2019s staunchest supporter and ever the sympathetic observer, Phineas believed that his\nbrother-in-law had been unjustly driven out by jealous, conspiring elders. He expressed his opinion that men such\nas Sidney Rigdon, Thomas Marsh, George Hinkle, George Robinson, and others, nurturing ulterior motives,\ntesti ed against President Cowdery and gave Joseph Smith prejudicial information. Oliver, feeling outnumbered,\nbelieved that defending himself against these biased witnesses was futile.\nPhineas\u2019s December 1842 correspondence with the Twelve clari ed several issues raised during Oliver\nCowdery\u2019s high council hearing four years earlier. Cowdery contradicted persistent reports of his supposed claim\nthat if he left the church, it would collapse. Phineas reported that Oliver never harbored such a pretentious\nattitude, that such an arrogant disposition never entered the Second Elder\u2019s heart. In addition, Oliver had\nconcerns that promissory notes he once held against Brigham Young and others, which were paid off or settled,\nhad been turned over to Oliver Granger for delivery to the parties concerned. Somehow these obligations were\nsold or given to Granger\u2019s son Gilbert for collection. The fraudulent use of these notes caused Cowdery \u201cgreat\nanxiety\u201d because he felt personally responsible for their proper and lawful disposition. These and other issues had\nnot been resolved, and Cowdery felt that they tarnished his reputation and wanted them settled.\nNear the end of 1842, although involved with his legal practice in Tif n, Oliver volunteered to leave home to help\nprepare a legal defense for Elder John Snyder. Leader of a company of British Mormon converts, Snyder was\narrested for mutiny in New Orleans. 11 Cowdery was ready, with the authorization of the Nauvoo High Council, to\ngo with Phineas to New Orleans. Phineas assured Brigham and Joseph Smith\u2019s secretary, Willard Richards, that \u201cI\nam satis ed [Oliver] has no sinister motives in the above proposition, as he is crowded with business continually.\u201d It\nis unlikely that the Twelve responded to Cowdery\u2019s offer since Elder Snyder was released from jail by the second\nweek of January 1843. 12William W. Phelps, one of the Prophet\u2019s personal secretaries and himself a recently reclaimed elder, wrote to\nCowdery in March 1843. 13 This was the earliest recorded written contact by a church representative with Oliver\nsince his defection. For unexplained reasons, Oliver viewed Phelps\u2019s letter as a \u201cstrange . . . epistle.\u201d He told Phineas\nthat Phelps did not request a reply but he planned to write him back anyhow. 14 A week later, Cowdery changed his\nmind, explaining that since Phelps did not speci cally ask for an answer, \u201cI have not written him in return.\u201d 15\nDuring the summer of 1843, Oliver received word from his brother Lyman that Phineas had returned to Kirtland.\nHe looked forward to a visit from his esteemed brother-in-law. Cowdery thought about going to Kirtland, but\nreferred to the dif culty in leaving a professional business to be \u201cabsent a few weeks when one has numerous\ncompetitors.\u201d Oliver bragged that his legal practice was increasing steadily and that nothing stood in his way\nexcept his previous involvement with Mormonism. He anguished over this intolerance:\nWere it not for this, I believe I could rise to the height of my ambition. But, shame on the man, or men, who\nare so beneath themselves, as to make this a barrier. My God has sustained me, and is able still to sustain\nme\u2014and through his own mysterious providence to lift me above all my foes. With his dealings I will be\ncontent. 16\nCowdery was unaware that months earlier, on 19 April, during a routine Wednesday afternoon meeting, Joseph\nSmith instructed the Twelve to invite their former colleague back into church fellowship and service. According to\nWillard Richards, keeper of the Prophet\u2019s journal, Joseph directed: \u201cWrite to Oliver Cowdery and ask him if he has\nnot eat[en] husks long enough, if he is not most ready to return [be clothed with robes of righteousness], and go up\nto Jerusalem. Orson Hyde hath need of him.\u201d 17 Richards noted that the Twelve immediately drafted a letter that\nwas \u201csigned by the members of the Quorum present.\u201d In their invitational epistle, addressed speci cally to Oliver\nas one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, the Twelve observed:\nWe thought perhaps our old, long esteemed friend might by this time have felt his lonely, solitary\nsituation; might feel that he was a stranger in a strange land, and had wandered long enough from his\nFather\u2019s house and that he might have a disposition to return. If this is the case, all that we have got to say\nis, your brethren are ready to receive you; we are not your enemies, but your brethren. Your dwelling place\nyou know ought to be in Zion\u2014your labor might be needed in Jerusalem, and you ought to be the servant\nof the living God. 18\nThe Twelve told Oliver that they would be \u201chappy to have an answer from you to let us know your feeling\u201d and\nasked him to respond to quorum president Brigham Young at Nauvoo.\nThis invitation to return, although composed, signed, and dated April 1843, for unexplained reasons, was not\nmailed until December. In August, Phineas Young, aware of the invitation, told Oliver about the Twelve\u2019s dispatch.\nOliver replied: \u201cYou say \u2018the Twelve\u2019 say they have written me. I have received nothing from them.\u201d Cowdery\nreminded Phineas that the only communication he had received from church leaders was the \u201cstrange unmeaning\nletter from my old friend Phelps last spring.\u201d 19 Finally, on 20 December, Oliver received the Twelve\u2019s epistle, which\nhe noted had a 10 December Nauvoo postmark.\nDespite the letter\u2019s delay, Oliver took time Christmas day to respond. He admitted his confusion over the detained\nletter but assumed that \u201cfeelings of friendship and kindness therein expressed are the same now, as then.\u201d 20\nAccepting the Twelve\u2019s epistle as a \u201cfriendly letter,\u201d Cowdery reciprocated their cordial sentiments by assertingthat he held \u201cno unkindly feelings\u201d toward them. He readily admitted the truth of their observation that he lived a\n\u201c\u2018lonely, solitary situation\u2014a stranger in a strange land'\u201d and confessed that it \u201cis true, strictly true.\u201d Oliver wrote:\nIt has been a long time, nearly six years\u2014the winds and waves, oods and storms, have been arrayed to\noppose me; and I need hardly say to you, that the Lord alone has upheld me, till I have fought up, labored\nup, and struggled up, to a fair reputation and a fair business in my present profession. 21\nCowdery longed to put the strife associated with his June 1838 departure from Far West behind him. The\nsituation, he explained, was \u201cpainful to re ect on.\u201d In a genuine spirit of reconciliation, Oliver offered his personal\ninterpretation of the circumstances leading to his dismissal. He observed candidly:\nI believed at the time, and still believe, that ambitious and wicked men, envying the harmony existing\nbetween myself and the rst elders of the church, and hoping to get into some other men\u2019s birthright, by\nfalsehoods the most foul and wicked, caused all this dif culty from beginning to end. They succeeded in\ngetting myself out of the church; but since they themselves have gone to perdition, ought not old friends\u2014\nlong tried in the furnace of af iction, to be friends still? 22\nOliver also told Brigham and the other members of the Twelve that he did not believe any of them had contributed\nto his removal and thus could speak freely with them about returning. 23 In his reply to the Twelve\u2019s invitation,\nOliver mentioned a \u201ccertain publication,\u201d signed by some eighty-three church members then living in Missouri,\ncharging him and others with conspiring with outlaws. 24 Cowdery emphatically denied such a vile indictment. He\nconceded that he had not seen the offending declaration but had heard of its existence and the accusations made\nin it.\nSix months later, near noon on that tragic 27 June, the Prophet Joseph Smith, while incarcerated in Carthage Jail,\nwas visited by Almon W. Babbitt. During his stay with the Prophet, Babbitt read a communication received\nrecently from Oliver Cowdery. 25 Although the letter has been lost and its speci c contents remain unknown, it can\nbe presumed from Oliver\u2019s recent optimistic overtures that his was a congenial letter. 26\nCowdery\u2019s reaction to news of Joseph\u2019s murder was captured in a statement by William Lang, a Tif n, Ohio,\nattorney who studied law under Oliver\u2019s supervision. Lang reported:\n[Joseph] Smith was killed while [Oliver] C[owdery] lived here. I well remember the effect upon his\ncountenance when he read the news in my presence. He immediately took the paper over to his house to\nread to his wife. On his return to the of ce we had a long conversation on the subject, and I was surprised\nto hear him speak with so much kindness of a man that had so wronged him as Smith had. It elevated him\ngreatly in my already high esteem, and proved to me more than ever the nobility of his nature. 27\nPhineas Young, traveling east on another mission, spent four days in November 1844 with Cowdery at his home in\nTif n. Soon afterwards, Phineas wrote to Brigham. He conveyed that \u201c[Oliver] sends love to you and all old\nfriends,\u201d adding parenthetically that Oliver \u201csees the folly of Sidney [Rigdon]\u2019s course.\u201d 28 In a further attempt to\nreclaim Oliver Cowdery, Phineas told his brother, \u201cThere are many things I want to say . . . therefore I will write\nsomewhat to you on a certain subject that I wish you to disclose to no one, but ponder the same in your heart.\u201d\nWith this in mind, Phineas asked Brigham to re ectback on the days of sorrow witnessed by our beloved Prophet and his old friend O[liver] Cowdery. Watch\ntheir prayers and tears, consider their feelings and friendship for each other, see them in Colesville in\ntheir weakness, remember them in Jackson [County], Missouri, in Kirtland, Ohio, all was peace, all was\nlove. Did they ever quarrel? No. Did they ever forsake each other? No. What was the dif culty? 29\nPhineas blamed Thomas B. Marsh and others at Far West in 1838 with conspiracy in driving Oliver Cowdery out\nof the church by charging him with apostasy, forgery, and theft. George W. Robinson, Rigdon\u2019s son-in-law, was\nsingled out as having driven Oliver from his home in June 1838. 30 Phineas insisted that if the charges \u201cwere\nplaced on the heads of those apostates\u201d (that is, Marsh, Robinson, and others), then Oliver Cowdery would admit\nhis shortcomings, make amends for his weaknesses, and rejoin the Saints. Phineas encouraged Brigham to publish\na statement in the church\u2019s Nauvoo periodical, the Times and Seasons, explaining \u201cto the Saints and to the world\nthat these charges were false and instigated by false brethren.\u201d 31 Cowdery anticipated returning as a useful,\nproductive member of the church. He believed that he would not be considered a credible witness of the early\nevents of the restoration without a statement clearing him of the Missouri charges. Brigham, preoccupied with the\nmounting pressure from apostates and antagonistic non-Mormons that would eventually force the Saints to ee\nNauvoo, did not respond to his brother\u2019s appeal.\nNearly a year later, in October 1845, during another visit from Phineas, Oliver wrote again to Brigham Young.\nOnce more, he offered his legal and personal services to the church. This time the matter was the Saints\u2019\nanticipated departure from Nauvoo and surrounding areas and their journey west into Mexican territory. While\ntogether in Tif n, Oliver and Phineas discussed the probability of the church needing to send out an \u201cexploring\ncompany\u201d to nd a less-hostile, uninhabited gathering location. Cowdery sensed the strong national desire to push\nAmerica\u2019s borders farther west to the Paci c and recognized how it could be combined with the Latter-day Saints\u2019\nneed to nd refuge in either the uninhabited Rocky Mountains or upper California. He proposed traveling to\nWashington, D.C., to visit President Polk and other national leaders about dispatching a Mormon colonizing party\nand, as he said, \u201cif favorably received, ask aid.\u201d Oliver, fearing he would be perceived as ambitious or scheming for a\nleadership position, explained: \u201cI only wish to say, that should you determine on a removal to the west, and wish me\nto see President Polk, and others as I have stated, you will signify such a wish, and any aid I can render you, will be\ncheerfully done, as I have said to Brother Phineas.\u201d 32\nBrigham Young directed his clerk, W. W. Phelps, to respond to Cowdery\u2019s generous but unsolicited offer. In early\nDecember, Phelps, in a succinct letter, expressed President Young\u2019s current attitude toward federal assistance in\ntheir westward trek: \u201cWe have concluded to let this rotten government alone, and shall not petition at\nWashington.\u201d 33 It appears that after many frustrating years during which the Saints unsuccessfully sought redress\nfrom the national government for their privations in Missouri, the governing Quorum of Twelve had all but lost\ncon dence in the integrity of the federal government and did not want to enter into any entangling agreements\nwith it. This antigovernment assistance stance mellowed by January 1846 when Brigham Young sent his\nrepresentative, Jesse Little, to Washington seeking President Polk\u2019s support for the Saints\u2019 offer to construct\nblockhouses and bridges and enlist Mormon military recruits in exchange for government support in their exodus\nwest. 34\nAlso in Phelps\u2019s reply was a renewed invitation for Oliver to rejoin with the Saints and go west. Phelps, addressing\nhimself as \u201cyour old associate,\u201d entreated his former coeditor of the Evening and the Morning Star, \u201cAs to our Exodus,\nif you believe that we are Israel, come on and go with us and we will do you good, for the Spirit says come, and your\nfriends say come, and let him that is athirst say come, with all things ready.\u201d 35Oliver Cowdery accepted Phelps\u2019s epistle as friendly and thanked him for writing, but commented to Phineas that\nthe letter from Phelps was \u201cvery short\u201d and \u201cvery different from what I had anticipated.\u201d Con ding with Phineas,\nOliver shared his prolonged concern that the old Missouri dif culties had not been resolved, and until they were,\nhe felt unable to return to full fellowship. In a tone re ecting both frustration and conciliation, he wrote to\nPhineas:\nI think some times, that my frequent letters to you on the subject of, what I have so often expressed\nanxiety upon, has led you to believe me of cious and overanxious; and though I have often been\ndisappointed, there is notwithstanding, an act of justice due to me, not only for my own, but for the sake\nand character of my friends and relatives; and particularly those who are yet in the Church. So far as\nothers are concerned, they care nothing about it. Indeed, I sometimes think, they wish it never to be given,\nas that may effectually prevent my return. You know my feelings fully on this subject\u2014you will present\nthem to Bro. Brigham\u2014tell him I am more and more anxious that matters be settled\u2014the sooner the\nbetter, of course. 36\nIn spite of Cowdery\u2019s distress, his name was not immediately cleared nor was his reputation cleansed of the\noffending charges.\nDuring the spring of 1846, Oliver\u2019s frustration peaked over a letter he received from Orson Hyde. Cowdery wrote\nthat he did not fully understand the purpose of Hyde\u2019s epistle, admitting that he either misunderstood or was \u201c[in]\nspirit misconceived by me.\u201d 37 Although Orson Hyde\u2019s letter is not extant, we do know from a letter he sent to\nBrigham Young in early March 1846 that he believed the ongoing efforts to reclaim Cowdery would eventually\npay off. Elder Hyde informed President Young that he had put down those who were advocating Strangism and\nPagism; he then mentioned the return of the prodigal Luke Johnson and boldly predicted \u201cOliver will come next.\u201d 38\nAgain the former Associate President, in a letter to his brother-in-law, emphasized his anxiety for his reputation.\nCowdery mentioned: \u201cI have only sought, and only asked, that my character might stand exonerated from those\ncharges which imputed to me the crimes of theft, forgery, &c. Those which all my former associates knew to be\nfalse.\u201d In making this statement, Oliver was not expecting to be excused from admitting any real shortcomings or\nwrongs. He readily admitted he had many faults. In what has become Cowdery\u2019s most impassioned plea, one\nfocused on his desire to be considered a credible witness of the early restoration to future generations, he wrote:\nI have cherished a hope, and that one of my fondest, that I might leave such a character, as those who\nmight believe in my testimony, after I should be called hence, might do so, not only for the sake of the\ntruth, but might not blush for the private character of the man who bore that testimony. I have been\nsensitive on this subject, I admit; but I ought to be so\u2014you would be, under the circumstances, had you\nstood in the presence of John, with our departed Brother Joseph, to receive the Lesser Priesthood\u2014and\nin the presence of Peter, to receive the Greater, and looked down through time, and witnessed the effects\nthese two must produce,\u2014you would feel what you have never felt, were wicked men conspiring to lessen\nthe effects of your testimony on man, after you should have gone to your long sought rest. 39\nOliver expressed his con dence that \u201cno unjust imputation will be suffered to remain upon my character\u201d and \u201cI am\nfully, doubly, satis ed, that all will be right\u2014that my character will be fully vindicated.\u201d 40 Having eloquently\nexpressed his concerns, Oliver did not mention the \u201ccharacter\u201d issue again in any of his letters.Phineas, in a letter written between 5 and 9 March, discussed with Oliver the subject of \u201c2nd Eldership,\nCounsellorship\u201d and noticed the upcoming church conference on 6 April. This caused Oliver to reminisce about\nthe organization of the church of Christ on 6 April 1830. He wrote: \u201cBrother Phineas, [if] I could be with you, and\ntell you about the 6th of April, 1830, when but six members only belonged [to] the Church, and how we looked\nforward to a future, I should gladly, but I cannot\u2014only in spirit\u2014but in spirit I shall be with you.\u201d 41 From this and\nother comments one senses a yearning on Cowdery\u2019s part to once again be personally involved in and associated\nwith the church. In this March 1846 letter, Oliver expressed his intention to get out of debt so that he could move\nwest with the Saints. He told his friend Phineas that \u201cThe situation of my family is such, that it is not possible for\nme to come with them, this Spring; but I want to be prepared at the earliest moment.\u201d Cowdery concluded this\ntouching letter with his blessing: \u201cM[ay] the Lord God of our Father\u2019s bless you, and yours\u2014and the Church, as a\nbody. Such is my prayer\u2014such is my heart. I am yours in the new and everlasting covenant.\u201d As with previous letters\nwritten during this period, Oliver asked that the contents of his letter remain con dential with the Twelve.\nSometime in July, Oliver Cowdery received a letter from Phebe Jackson, his other half-sister. In her communiqu\u00e9,\nshe con ded to her brother the emotional distress she felt concerning the trials and tribulations anticipated in the\ntrek west. She also expressed personal anxiety with the emerging practice of plural marriage among the Saints.\nOliver, evidently uninformed by Phineas about the continuance of polygamy at Nauvoo, wrote an emotional reply\nto Phebe and her husband, Daniel. A brief excerpt reads,\nNow, brother Daniel and Sister Phebe, what will you do? Has Sister Phebe written us the truth? . . . I can\nhardly think it possible, that you have written us the truth, that though there may be individuals who are\nguilty of the iniquities spoken of\u2014yet no such practice can be preached or adhered to, as a public\ndoctrine. 42\nCowdery\u2019s response to this news is intriguing. He spoke from personal experience when he pointed out the\nimprudence of plural marriage as a \u201cpublic doctrine.\u201d Recorded in historical records are credible witnesses to the\nfact that Oliver himself was involved in and censured for an unauthorized polygamous relationship during the\nchurch\u2019s stay in Kirtland, Ohio, during the 1830s. 43 In this period, Joseph Smith married his rst plural wife\u2014\nFanny Alger. 44 It is unclear why Cowdery, on his own authority, felt the need to take an additional wife. By 1835,\nthe Mormon Church was being publicly \u201creproached\u201d for the \u201ccrime\u201d of polygamy. In Oliver\u2019s carefully worded\n\u201cArticle on Marriage,\u201d which rst appeared in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, a public statement\nwas made defending the church against immoral conduct. In this article, polygamy was renounced and monogamy\ndeclared to be the belief of the church. Later in Missouri, one charge preferred against Cowdery was that he\naccused Joseph Smith of adultery. 45 Two years after this emotionally charged social issue was brought to his\nattention in 1846, during his lengthy private conversations with Elders Orson Hyde and George A. Smith at\nKanesville in October\u2014November 1848, Oliver was evidently brought up-to-date on the Nauvoo-era application\nof the plural-marriage doctrine.\nAlso, in his response to Phebe and Daniel, Oliver said that his emigration with the church depended on\ncircumstances. He did not elaborate on what those situations might be, but his struggles with plural marriage,\nexhausted nances, and ever-fragile health were relevant concerns. Yet in spite of these concerns, Cowdery was\nconvinced that going west offered a most hopeful prospect. To Phebe and her husband, Oliver wrote optimistically,\n\u201cSo far as going west is concerned, I have thought it a wise move\u2014indeed, I could see no other; and though the\njourney is long, and attended with toil, yet a bright future has been seen in the distance.\u201d 46Later, in November 1846, Oliver answered a letter received \u201ca long time since\u201d from Phineas. Cowdery was\nuncertain his brother-in-law would get the letter given the \u201cconfusion and dif culty then existing at Nauvoo.\u201d He\nhad been anxiously waiting for answers to speci c questions asked in his last letters. It is possible that Oliver was\nreferring to inquiries he had made about the Saints\u2019 living the doctrine of plural marriage. Preoccupied with his\nfrail health and desiring to better himself professionally, Oliver announced to Phineas that he was selling his Tif n\nlaw practice and moving in the spring. 47\nSometime between late November and mid-December 1846, Oliver Cowdery traveled to Washington, D.C.,\nwhere he visited his political contacts. Before departing for Washington, he wrote to Phineas and asked him to nd\nout if the church leaders wanted information that might be of help to them in their westward migration. Noting\nthat the then-raging war with Mexico would afford an opportune diversion for the church, Oliver offered his\nunsolicited advice for handling the politically sensitive situation of wintering on federal lands set aside speci cally\nfor the Indians. He explained, \u201c[I] have made the foregoing suggestions out of the deep feelings of my soul, and\nbecause the welfare of that church, the foundations of which my own hands helped to lay, is constantly near my\nthoughts.\u201d 48 Cowdery\u2019s mid-November letter received notice during a council meeting on 22 December 1846.\nBrigham Young\u2019s history reports, \u201cA favorable letter from O. Cowdery to Phinehas H. Young was read.\u201d 49\nAt this point, efforts by the church leaders to facilitate Oliver Cowdery\u2019s anticipated reconciliation with the church\nwent into limbo for nearly a year. Several reasons exist for the delay. First, the church leaders\u2019 attention and the\nchurch\u2019s resources were focused on supplying and organizing for the forced westward movement of thousands of\nSaints. Second, Oliver had not received the expected exoneration from the false charges made against him at Far\nWest, Missouri, in 1838 along with the associated restoration of his reputation. Third, Cowdery did not have\nsuf cient means to out t a wagon and team for a pioneer trek. Fourth, the Saints\u2019 immediate future was uncertain\nand Oliver, already suffering physically and nancially, hoped to rejoin and live with the Saints under less life-\nthreatening conditions. 50 During this interlude, Oliver kept busy as a lawyer. For several months, he was\ntemporary editor of the Seneca Advertiser while his editor friend, John Breslin, attended to state political\nresponsibilities at Columbus, Ohio. 51 The Mormon leaders, scattered across the Midwestern plains, turned their\nfocus toward the impending exodus of the scattered Saints from the state of Iowa and Nebraska territory.\nBy mid-February 1847, Cowdery wrote again to Phineas. He was deeply concerned because he had not heard\nfrom his revered brother-in-law or other relatives in some time. Oliver con ded, \u201cFor no day passes without our\nthoughts being turned towards our relatives and once loved friends, who are toiling and struggling in the far-off\nwilderness, during a cold pitiless winter.\u201d 52 Reporting on his recent trip to Washington, Oliver informed Phineas\nthat from his personal conversations with his political contacts and the information he gathered, no one in\nauthority at the federal district planned to give the displaced Latter-day Saints any dif culty with their settling\ntemporarily upon Indians\u2019 territorial land. As expected, the executive and legislative leaders in Washington were\npreoccupied by the ongoing war with Mexico. Oliver pointed out that he perceived a feeling of sympathy in the\nnation\u2019s capital toward the uprooted Saints. 53 Although Cowdery asked to be remembered to his former\nassociates, including Brigham Young, Luke Johnson, and William W. Phelps, he did not discuss rejoining the Saints\nthat spring.\nOliver left Tif n, Ohio, in April 1847 and went to Wisconsin to explore immediate career options there and to be\nclose to his brother Lyman, who had moved there the previous fall. Oliver saw the Wisconsin Territory, on the\nthreshold of statehood, as a land of interim opportunity. He hoped that southern Wisconsin\u2019s climate would be\nbetter suited to his fragile health and that a developing economy would possibly improve his struggling lawpractice. He settled in southern Wisconsin, at Elkhorn, less than twenty miles from the Illinois state line. Oliver\u2019s\nlater actions suggest that he was purposefully positioning himself closer to the Iowa exodus camps of the Saints.\nWithin two months of his arrival, brothers Oliver and Lyman were again working together as attorneys.\nDuring the last week of July, William E. McLellin arrived in southern Wisconsin to talk with Oliver Cowdery.\nMcLellin, one of the original latter-day apostles called in 1835, became disillusioned and left the church in 1836. In\nthe summer of 1847, he was traveling west from his home in Kirtland attempting to \u201cprepare the way for the old\nship to unhitch her cables and again sail forth\u201d by gathering the Three Witnesses into his faction. 54 McLellin came\nto Wisconsin speci cally to meet with and possibly persuade the unaf liated former Second Elder to join his\nmovement. 55 Cowdery received him as a \u201cmutual friend and former co-laborer.\u201d During a \u201clengthy conversation,\u201d 56\nthey discussed their personal views of priesthood authority and the future of the church restored through the\nefforts of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1830. Oliver made no commitments to McLellin. He simply\ndiscussed his religious opinions with McLellin and then they parted after a two-day visit.\nPrompted by McLellin\u2019s visit, Oliver penned a con dential dispatch to his brother-in-law David Whitmer. Cowdery\ncandidly expressed to his fellow Book of Mormon witness his opinion that the church was \u201clying to\u201d or inactive\n\u201ceither for want of pilots or hands to work her.\u201d He tersely dismissed Sidney Rigdon and James Strang as\nuninspired men who were not called by God to lead the church after Joseph Smith was \u201cmeanly and unlawfully\nmurdered.\u201d As for the Twelve\u2019s claim to succession, Cowdery was more open-minded. He considered, \u201c[They] have\nperhaps not as a matter of choice at rst, but of necessity taken such as would adhere to them and ed to the\nwestern slope of our continent.\u201d In this private letter, Oliver expressed his conviction that he still held the\npriesthood keys and authority conferred on Joseph Smith and him beginning in 1829. He readily admitted that he\ndid not know whether the Lord would again call David and him to \u201cwork in his great cause.\u201d As before, Oliver\u2019s\nconcern for reputation and character resurfaced. He explained that,\nIf ever the church rises again in true holiness, it must arise in a measure upon our testimony, and upon our\ncharacters as good men. Such being the case, . . . some one should step forward\u2014capable and worthy, who\nknew us well, and whose heart the Lord should or has touched, whose duty and of ce should be to\nvindicate our characters, and disabuse the minds of the honest of those prejudices which they do and\nwould otherwise labor under. All this must be done without solicitation on our part. And it is expedient it\nshould be done by [some]one who has known us from the beginning. 57\nTo his trusted relative, Oliver declared his willingness, when circumstances were appropriate, to be involved again\nin the building up of the Lord\u2019s kingdom. In the letter\u2019s conclusion, Cowdery summarized his heartfelt feelings\nabout his involvement in the latter-day work, \u201cI will only say that when the time comes, I am ready! But I am not\npersuaded that it has yet fully come. Let the Lord vindicate our characters, and cause our testimony to shine, and\nthen will men be saved in his kingdom.\u201d 58\nFive weeks after parting with Oliver in Wisconsin, McLellin, while visiting John and David Whitmer in Missouri,\nobtained a copy of Cowdery\u2019s personal letter to David Whitmer along with Whitmer\u2019s private response. 59 Eight\nmonths later, back in Kirtland, McLellin, without permission from either Cowdery or Whitmer, published the\nletters in the May 1848 issue of his Ensign of Liberty.\nIn October 1847, Hiram Page, Oliver\u2019s wife\u2019s brother-in-law and one of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of\nMormon, contacted Oliver Cowdery. Page was also estranged from the church. He advised Oliver not to committo any Mormon reaf liation until they (i.e., Page, the Whitmers, and Cowdery) could counsel together. Probably\nbecause Cowdery could afford neither the time nor the expense in traveling to Missouri for a meeting, he did not\nrespond to Page\u2019s invitation. Whatever his reasons for not replying, within six months Oliver wrote to David\nWhitmer encouraging him to meet at Council Bluffs so they could settle their differences with the Latter-day Saint\nChurch led by Brigham Young. 60\nBy late November 1847, just before the reorganization of the First Presidency, Brigham Young, writing collectively\nfor the Twelve, renewed contact with Oliver Cowdery through his brother Phineas. This epistle from the Twelve\nwas actually written in late November but not dispatched until Christmas 1847, shortly after the reorganization of\nthe presidency, and was hand-carried to Oliver by Phineas. In it Oliver was questioned about his declared interest\nin the \u201csalvation of Israel in these last days,\u201d asked about the testimony that he previously bore with \u201cunshaken\ncon dence,\u201d and again invited to be rebaptized. The Twelve\u2019s invitation was typically straightforward, yet lled with\ncompassion. They wrote:\n[We] say to you in the Spirit of Jesus, . . . come for all things are now ready and the Spirit and the Bride say\ncome, and return to our Father\u2019s house, from whence thou hast wandered, and partake of the fatted calf\nand sup and be lled, and again be adorned with the Jewels of Salvation, and be shod with the preparation\nof the Gospel of Peace, by putting your hand in Elder [Phineas] Young\u2019s and walking straightway into the\nWaters of Baptism, and receiving the laying on of his hands and the of ce of an Elder, and go forth with\nhim and proclaim repentance unto this generation and renew thy testimony to the Truth of the Book of\nMormon with a loud voice and faithful heart. 61\nOliver was offered the assurance that the Saints \u201cwill with open arms hail thee as their long lost . . . brother found\nin the new and everlasting covenant.\u201d 62\nOn 27 February 1848, in a \u201cprivate and con dential\u201d letter from Elkhorn, Cowdery replied. With increased\nenthusiasm, he acknowledged:\nBy the hand of Brother Phinehas H. Young I received your epistle of Dec[ember] last, and after reading it\ncarefully and conversing freely with Brother Phinehas, have thought that if circumstances would permit, I\nwould visit you in the early part of the Spring, say as soon as the 6th of April, if possible. 63\nTo avoid raising false hopes, Oliver warned that his visit in early April could be delayed due to \u201ccertain business\u201d he\nmight be obliged to ful ll. At that time, Lyman Cowdery had drafted a legislative bill that, with assistance, would be\nintroduced in the Wisconsin Territorial council and house of representatives authorizing Oliver to prepare \u201ca\ncomplete Index arranged in Alphabetical order of all the session Laws from the year[s] 1839 to 1848 inclusive.\u201d\nOliver, through this proposed index bill, had the potential to earn up to $650. This was Cowdery\u2019s opportunity to\nraise the money needed to purchase an adequate team and wagon for the trip west. With support, the bill passed\nthe council on the third, but was negated by the House on 7 March 1848. 64\nIn his February letter, Oliver told Brigham that he had just written to David Whitmer \u201cadvising him, . . . by all means\nto be at Winter Quarters on the 6th of April.\u201d Oliver felt that he and David needed to meet with \u201cmany valuable old\nfriends, and time too, of conversing upon interesting subjects.\u201d He promised to explain his objective more\ncompletely later.A month later, after the failure of Lyman\u2019s proposed index bill, Oliver informed Phineas that he anticipated leaving\nElkhorn for Winter Quarters, but was caught, the previous Saturday, in a thundershower that brought on, as he\ndescribed, \u201cone of the severest attacks of chills and fever\u2014a regular Sandusky attack.\u201d He expressed his\ndisappointment in not being physically able to leave as planned but was optimistic that with a few days\u2019 rest, he\nwould regain his health and be on his way. Oliver expected, with the cooperation of his \u201clittle nag\u201d and good dry\nroads, to travel fty miles a day and make the over four-hundred-mile journey in little more than a week. 65\nUnfortunately, this was not to be. Oliver Cowdery\u2019s sickness continued for two weeks more, and thus he missed\nthe opportunity to be at April conference.\nOn 7 April 1848, during the afternoon session of the second day of general conference, Elder Phineas Young was\ninvited to report on his recent mission. The conference was held in the log tabernacle at Council Bluffs. Obviously\ndisappointed by Oliver\u2019s failure to arrive as expected, Phineas described his journey east, which included a First\nPresidency-assigned stop in Wisconsin to visit Oliver Cowdery. Elder Young reported that,\nThis is the rst opportunity of seeing so many since last Xmas\u2014I journeyed to the East\u2014and but recently\nret[urne]d . . . I went to see the 2nd El[der] in the C[hurch] of J[esus] C[hrist of] L[atter] D[ay] S[aints]\nO[liver] Cowd[e]ry and once more invite him to return to his Fat[he]rs house\u2014found him in good health\nand prep[are]d to rece[ive] the word which I [h]ad from the 1st Pres[idenc]y and the 12\u2014it might be\nimpossible for him to get to this conf[erence], but he wo[ul]d be here bef[ore] the 1st Pres[idenc]y go over\nthe mountains\u2014he is willing to do his 1st works over ag[ai]n[.] he wrote to\u00e2\u20ac\u201aDavid Whitmer &c[.] I\n[h]av[e] not learned that they\u00e2\u20ac\u201a[a]r[e] on the wa[y]\u2014I bel[ieve] they will all be here as soon as\ncir[cumstanc]es will permit\u2014he [Oliver Cowdery] conversed freely ab[ou]t the coming forth of this work\nand was conscious that I [h]ad ful lled my mission. 66\nWilford Woodruff, present at the afternoon conference session, noted in his journal his observations about what\nPhineas said regarding his stay with the Book of Mormon witness. Elder Woodruff emphasized that Phineas\nmentioned Oliver\u2019s feelings for the Saints. 67\nNine days later, on 16 April, Cowdery addressed a long letter to his friend Phineas. He explained his delay,\ndescribed his prolonged recovery, and observed that making the journey to Council Bluffs\u2014stopping in Richmond,\nMissouri, to visit the Whitmers and returning to Elkhorn in time for court\u2014would not be possible in so short a\ntime. Oliver wrote optimistically about their future. He said that he had, for quite some time, determined to move\nto what he called the \u201cnew purchase.\u201d 68 During Phineas\u2019s visit the previous February, they talked about\nestablishing a fruit tree nursery enterprise in the Salt Lake Valley. In mid-April, Cowdery shared with his brother-\nin-law his feelings about the proposal. He wrote: \u201cThe more I have re ected on it, the more anxious have I been to\nengage in the business.\u201d Oliver recommended they gather a large inventory of seeds, even offering to obtain them\nin Ohio and bring them with him in the fall.\nCowdery, the forty-two-year-old lawyer, in his personal letter to Phineas declared that he was now planning to\nmake the western migration to the Great Basin in the fall with Bishop Reuben Miller. Sometime that previous\nwinter, Bishop Miller, a reclaimed church leader from Strang\u2019s movement and Cowdery\u2019s Wisconsin neighbor,\ngenerously offered to out t a team for the Second Elder and his family to use to go west. Oliver noted that Miller\nstood ready to grant him any assistance needed for the move. 69In this letter, Cowdery anxiously asked for information about the recent church conference. His most pressing\nquestion dealt with whether David Whitmer had responded to his request to be at the conference. He asked,\nWas David there? Were any steps taken towards effecting the reconciliation and union of which we\ntalked, and which is so much to be desired? Tell me plainly on all these. Had I been permitted to have been\nthere, these matters would have engaged my earnest labors. . . . From henceforward, I shall double my\nefforts in effecting an harmonious, righteous reconciliation\u2014I know what is right, and hope I may soon see\nthat right take place.\nOver and over again in his correspondence with church leaders, Oliver asked whether he should rst visit the\nchurch\u2019s temporary headquarters at Kanesville in preparation for the move west. As Oliver sought counsel on\nthese decisions and other topics related to his reuniting with the church, he willingly deferred to either Phineas or\nBrigham for advice.\nDuring the spring of 1848, Oliver Cowdery had another distraction, unrelated to his declining health, to deal with.\nHe was nominated as the Elkhorn district\u2019s Democratic candidate for state assembly of the newly admitted state\nof Wisconsin. Whether Cowdery sought this position or was simply nominated by supporters, or whether he\nbelieved he could win the election is not known. However, the Democrats in Walworth County had gotten to know\nCowdery pretty well in the year he lived there. They had unshaken con dence in his political abilities. Several\narticles supporting his candidacy appeared in Wisconsin newspapers. 70 The Whig opposition, fearing Oliver\u2019s\ngrowing support, took advantage of Cowdery\u2019s most obvious political vulnerability by drawing attention to\nOliver\u2019s earlier Mormon connection. Especially damning in the opposition\u2019s mind was the fact that he was one of\nthe Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. 71 Oliver quietly withstood the criticism, campaigned con dently,\nand lost the election by only forty votes\u2014less than one-tenth of the vote. Immediately after Cowdery\u2019s narrow\nloss, his friend and Democratic ally Horace A. Tenney, editor of the state\u2019s major political newspaper, observed:\nWe regret to learn from the Walworth County Democrat that Oliver Cowdery Esq. was defeated for the\nAssembly in the Elkhorn district, by a small majority. He is a man of sterling integrity, sound and vigorous\nintellect, and every way worthy, honest and capable. He was defeated in consequence of his religion! 72\nWe can only speculate what Cowdery\u2019s future might have been had he been elected to the state assembly. The\nresponsibility and in uence of public of ce may have distracted Oliver from the anticipated move west. Once\nagain, this time in a narrow political defeat, Oliver may have sensed that any future professional success or\npersonal happiness was invariably connected to his association with the Mormon Church.\nNear the end of May, Reuben Miller wrote from the upper crossing of the Missouri River, twelve miles northwest\nof Kanesville, believing that Oliver, whom he had not seen since last winter, was visiting friends and family in\nRichmond, Missouri, and expected to arrive within days. Miller also assumed that Phineas Young had gone to\nMissouri to accompany Cowdery to Pottawattamie County. 73 Miller\u2019s expectation of Cowdery\u2019s departure from\nWisconsin and anticipated arrival in western Iowa was premature. Sometime that summer, Miller himself traveled\nback to Wisconsin. Oliver, on the other hand, remained in Elkhorn throughout the summer of 1848, where he\nrenewed his law practice and became associate editor of the Walworth Democrat.\nIn mid-September 1848, Reuben Miller, journeying south toward the gathered Saints at the Bluffs, visited several\nof his bygone acquaintances in LaSalle County, Illinois. While there he met Phineas Young, who was traveling north\nto Elkhorn to retrieve Oliver Cowdery. They spent 18 September together, during which Miller gave Young morethan eighty dollars. Ful lling his promise made the previous winter, Reuben Miller freely gave to help his friend\nOliver move with the Saints and migrate west. Miller noted in his journal that thirty-one dollars was appropriated\nfor Oliver Cowdery. 74\nPhineas Young arrived in Elkhorn by late September or early October. On Monday, 2 October, he witnessed the\nsale by Oliver and his wife, Elizabeth, of eight lots and an additional acre of land to Jonathan Delap for three\nhundred dollars. 75 In early October, Strang\u2019s nearby Gospel Herald commented on Cowdery\u2019s recent political and\nreligious activities and, in the process, noticed Phineas Young\u2019s presence and his mission. The editorial recognized,\n\u201cOn the whole, Oliver seems to be in good demand and rst rate standing. Even Phineas Young is here, telling that\nbrother Cowdery is going with him to Council Bluffs.\u201d 76 Within days of the real estate sale, Oliver, Elizabeth, and\nMaria, their only surviving child, accompanied by Phineas, departed Walworth County for the last time.\nThey made a hurried trip from southern Wisconsin to the Saints\u2019 camp in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. Phineas\nand the Cowderys arrived Saturday afternoon, 21 October, during a special local conference. They entered the\nopen-air meeting, convened in a grove close to Mosquito Creek in the vicinity of Council Bluffs, while Elder Orson\nHyde, the presiding of cial at Kanesville, was speaking. In addition to Hyde, apostles George A. Smith and Ezra Taft\nBenson were in attendance. Elder Hyde immediately recognized the presence of the former Associate President.\nReportedly, Hyde stopped speaking, came down off the stand and embraced Cowdery. Taking him by the arm,\nOrson brought Oliver up on the platform. After a brief introduction by Elder Hyde, Oliver was invited to speak to\nthe conference. Cowdery stood for a few moments looking out into the numerous faces in the audience. Oliver\nrecognized some, but most were strangers to him. Finally, after more than a decade\u2019s lonely separation from the\npeople he loved, the Second Elder was reunited with the Saints of God.\nWith overwhelming emotion swelling in his heart, yet in a clear and striking voice, Oliver Cowdery addressed this\ngathering of nearly two thousand people\u2014the largest Mormon audience he ever spoke to. He bore a spontaneous\nyet lucid testimony of his personal involvement in the early years of the Mormon Church. Cowdery detailed the\ncoming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods. He\nreaf rmed his staunch belief in the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s divine appointment and mission. Oliver recalled that\nyears earlier he had laid hands on Elder Hyde\u2019s head and ordained him to the priesthood and extended to him his\ncall as an apostle. Cowdery unequivocally acknowledged the Twelve\u2019s authority to lead the church. He also\ncommented on the nautical imagery used earlier by Elder Hyde in his conference discourse. Oliver said: \u201cBro.\nHyde has just said that it was all important that we keep in the true channel in order to avoid the sandbars. This is\ntrue. The channel is here. The priesthood is here.\u201d 77 Another report adds that Cowdery expressed his conviction\n\u201cthat the Priesthood was with this people, and the \u2018Twelve\u2019 were the only men that could lead the Church after the\ndeath of Joseph.\u201d 78 Given his years both in and out of the church, Oliver knew rsthand about spiritual \u201csandbars\u201d\nand priesthood authority.\nThe audience\u2019s reaction to Cowdery\u2019s spontaneous discourse was unanimously positive. George A. Smith noted in\na letter to Orson Pratt, \u201cHis testimony produced quite a sensation among the gentlemen present, who did not\nbelong to the church, and it was gratefully received by all the Saints.\u201d 79 Nevertheless, no immediate action was\ntaken nor motion made during the conference to readmit Oliver Cowdery.\nNine days later, on Monday, 30 October, Oliver spent the evening talking with Elders Orson Hyde and George A.\nSmith. He wanted to know their feelings toward him. It is supposed that Oliver was willing to respond to any\nquestions or concerns they had about him. Cowdery expressed his willingness to receive counsel from them. Theyadvised him to remain in Kanesville that winter, help Elder Hyde set up the Frontier Guardian press, and then\nmigrate west the next spring. During the meeting, Cowdery con ded with his two old friends that he had not come\nto Kanesville for a leadership position. His only desire in returning was to have his membership reinstated and to\nbe one among and live with the Saints. Oliver said, \u201cIf Mormonism goes up, I want my name to go up with it, and if it\ngoes down, my name goes down with it.\u201d 80 Oliver Cowdery recognized the necessity of being rebaptized and\naf rmed that he \u201cdid not expect to return without it.\u201d 81 He knew that baptism was the door back into the church.\nSince Oliver had been gone during a decade of spirited doctrinal development, Elders Hyde and Smith evidently\ntook the time during this evening discussion to bring Cowdery up-to-date. We know little about that aspect of\ntheir conversation, but it might have included discussion of such temple-related principles as baptism for the dead\nand the Nauvoo-era endowment. Given Oliver\u2019s previously expressed concern with the Saints\u2019 active participation\nin plural marriage, that topic was discussed and resolved in Cowdery\u2019s mind. 82 Before concluding, Elders Hyde\nand Smith requested that Oliver attend a combined meeting of high priests and the high council the rst Sunday in\nNovember to review his situation formally and accept him back into the church.\nThe Pottawattamie High Council met Saturday, 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201aNovember, at Hiram Clark\u2019s home in a preliminary session.\nOliver was not invited to this meeting. Orson Hyde raised the issue of Cowdery\u2019s readmittance. Several council\nmembers commented on the proposal. Elder Hyde mentioned a rumor that Phineas Young had \u201csecretly\u201d\nrebaptized the Second Elder while visiting in Wisconsin. This discussion was inappropriate since President\nBrigham Young, in the Twelve\u2019s December 1847 epistle, invited Cowdery to be rebaptized by Phineas. Regardless,\nno evidence exists that Phineas \u201csecretly\u201d or otherwise performed the baptism ordinance before Cowdery\u2019s\nformal return in October\u2014 November 1848. George A. Smith offered his personal views on Oliver\u2019s readmission\nand gave an account of his and Elder Hyde\u2019s private interview with Oliver Cowdery the previous Monday. Elder\nSmith also reviewed Oliver\u2019s deep involvement in the rst decade of the church and his subsequent apostasy. The\nhigh council adjourned, agreeing to meet with the high priests quorum the next day in an unusual joint session.\nOn Sunday, 5 November 1848, Oliver Cowdery joined with the high priests and Pottawattamie High Council 83 in\nthe Kanesville Log Tabernacle. 84 After some unrelated initial discussion, Orson Hyde addressed the group, noting\nthat Cowdery was present and \u201cwished to come back into the church\u201d and \u201cbe identi ed with us.\u201d Hyde requested\nthat Oliver speak to the assembled council. Cowdery responded that he \u201cdid not come to speak, but to be a looker\non, and to hear. . . . He wishe[d] to come into the Church in an humble manner, an humble follower of Jesus Christ,\nnot seeking any presidency.\u201d 85 Although reluctant at rst to speak, Cowdery did take the opportunity to express\nhis personal feelings about his prolonged absence from the church, gave his reasons for leaving, and concluded by\nacknowledging that those who were the cause of his estrangement had died or left the church. He said:\nI feel that I can honorably return. I have sustained an honorable character before the world during my\nabsence from you, this tho[ugh] a small matter with you, it is of vast importance. I have ever had the honor\nof the Kingdom in view, and men are to be judged by the testimony given. I feel to sanction what has been\nsaid here today. I am out of the church.\nI know the door into the church, and I wish to become a member thro[ugh] the door. I wish to be a humble\nprivate member. I did not come here to seek honor. 86\nAfter Cowdery spoke, George W. Harris motioned that Oliver Cowdery be allowed to be rebaptized. Evan M.\nGreene seconded the proposal. At this point, an intense discussion erupted. William Snow, president of the highpriests, questioned Oliver about his (Cowdery\u2019s) July 1847 letter to David Whitmer, published the previous May\nin McLellin\u2019s renegade Ensign of Liberty. Harris objected, saying that since Cowdery was asking to come back as a\n\u201chumble member, no action should be now taken upon that letter.\u201d George A. Smith agreed, adding, \u201cI am not afraid\nof [Oliver] overturning the Church.\u201d Phineas Young, along with several others, spoke in support of Cowdery\u2019s\nreadmission without further discussion of the offending letter. 87\nPresident Snow\u2019s concerns centered on Cowdery\u2019s bold statements to Whitmer regarding priesthood authority,\nkeys, and succession leadership, such as, \u201cTrue it is that our right gives us the head\u201d and \u201cWe have the authority\nand do hold the keys.\u201d Cowdery explained that the letter was a \u201cprivate\u201d letter, not for public exhibition and\npublished by McLellin without either his or David\u2019s knowledge or consent. 88 Cowdery elaborated that he had,\nsince writing the letter, changed his views on the subject. To this, President Snow asked what had changed his\nopinion. Oliver responded, \u201cWhen I wrote that letter I did not know of the Revelation [D&C 124:95] which says,\nthat the keys and power conferred upon me, were taken from me and placed upon the head of Hyrum Smith. And it\nwas that revelation which changed my views on this subject.\u201d 89 Evidently during their private discussions with\nOliver in late October 1848, Orson Hyde and George A. Smith made him aware of the January 1841 revelation. 90\nIn closing, Cowdery elaborated:\nI have not come to seek place, nor to interfere with the business and calling of those men who have borne\nthe burden since the death of Joseph. I throw myself at your feet, and wish to be one of your number, and\nbe a mere member of the Church, and my mere asking to be baptized is an end to all pretensions to\nauthority. 91\nOliver then assured the council: \u201cMy coming back and humbly asking to become a member through the door\ncovers the whole ground. I acknowledge this authority.\u201d 92 Elder Orson Hyde expressed his satisfaction with\nCowdery\u2019s explanation and called for a vote to the effect that \u201call past transactions be forgotten and that O.\nCowdery be received into this Church by Baptism.\u201d 93 A full vote was given and the proposal carried unanimously.\nFinally, six years after rst showing a desire to return, Cowdery was only days away from being rebaptized.\nAlthough trustworthy sources verify 12 November 1848 as Oliver Cowdery\u2019s rebaptism date, at least one of cial\nchurch record implies that he was rebaptized on 5 November. The high council minutes, written within days or\nweeks of the event, read:\nAfter some more remarks from different ones of the Brethren, the question was called up and Bro. O.\nCowdery was received back again into the church, on his being baptized, by a full vote, and many\nexpressed their grati ed feelings on the occasion. About 2 o\u2019clock p.m., he was Baptized by the hand of\nBro. Orson Hyde. 94\nOther contemporary sources support Sunday, 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201aNovember 1848, as the actual readmittance date. For\nunknown reasons, Cowdery was rebaptized a week after his meeting with the combined high council and high\npriests in the Kanesville Log Tabernacle. Orson Hyde wrote to his fellow apostle Wilford Woodruff on 11\nNovember 1848, explaining that \u201cBro. Oliver Cowdery has . . . made Satisfaction to the church and has been voted\nto be rec[eive]d by baptism. I expect to baptize him tomorrow.\u201d 95 Cowdery\u2019s temporal benefactor, Reuben Miller,\nwriting to a friend, con rmed the later date. Four days after the rebaptism, Miller acknowledged, \u201cBrother Oliver\nCowdery is here and has been baptized by Elder Hyde on last Sunday.\u201d 96His personal restoration to full membership marked a beginning for Oliver. He remained in the Kanesville area for\nthe next two and a half months, during which time Cowdery and his family stayed principally with Phineas Young.\nOliver immediately went to work helping Orson Hyde set up the printing press that would eventually publish the\nFrontier Guardian. 97\nBy early January 1849, Oliver had decided to take his small family and visit his in-laws, the Whitmers, in Missouri\nbefore setting out with the western migration in the spring. Heading southeast to Richmond, they encountered a\nruthless snowstorm in northwestern Missouri. Desperately seeking a haven from the blizzard, the Cowderys\ncalled at the cabin of Samuel W. Richards, a Latter-day Saint. The Cowdery and Richards families spent two weeks\nriding out the storm. As Samuel Richards later described his time with Cowdery, \u201cThis was not lost time to either of\nus.\u201d Being limited by the inclement weather, they had little to do, so they talked about the church. Elder Richards\nasked Oliver about his initial experiences with the Prophet Joseph Smith. Cowdery obliged, describing in vivid\ndetail the working method of the Book of Mormon translation. Richards was de nitely impressed; he summarized\nhis feelings about meeting the Second Elder:\nThis interview with Brother and Sister Cowdery was one of entire freedom and familiarity, although we\nhad never met before; and his experience in connection with the prophet Joseph, when the ministrations\nof Angels were frequent in restoring Priesthood, and the Keys of Knowledge . . . made it all a most divinely\nand sacred interview to me. 98\nBefore leaving in mid-January, Oliver agreed to return to Council Bluffs in the spring prepared for the early\nmigration to the Great Basin. 99 By late April 1849, while comfortably situated with the Whitmers in Richmond,\nCowdery\u2019s plans were becoming more tentative. He wrote Phineas Young and explained that he felt it a \u201cbad\npolicy\u201d to compete with the California gold rush teams who were thronging the trail. Cowdery con ded, \u201cThe idea\nof being crowded in and mixed up with companies\u2014thousands of gold hunters, would impel me to wait another\nyear, as a preference, if I could not safely go this fall.\u201d 100 In June, Cowdery contacted Phineas again, updating him\non his intentions: \u201cI have obliged to abandon the idea of going to the Mountains this season.\u201d Oliver\u2019s concerns\nwere not a wavering of his renewed Mormon af liation; he wholeheartedly wanted to be with the church. His\nanxieties were fueled by persisting nancial concerns and worry for his and his family\u2019s survival out on the western\ntrail and in the Great Basin. 101 Later, in the early fall of 1849, in his last known letter to his beloved friend Phineas\nYoung, Cowdery re ected:\nI am poor, very poor, and I did hope to have health and means suf cient last spring to go west and get\nsome gold, that I might so situate my family, that I could be engaged in the cause of God; but I did not\nsucceed. I was then in hope you could go . . . if I could not. Now, as neither of us went, let us not be\ndiscouraged, but press on, trusting in the Lord. 102\nIn July 1849, the First Presidency wrote directly to Oliver Cowdery, acknowledging his return 103 and exhorting\nhim to magnify his of ce by \u201clearning [his] duty towards God and man, and practicing according to that knowledge,\u201d\nalso requesting his cooperation with Almon W. Babbitt, Orson Hyde, and John Bernhisel to petition for Deseret to\nbe admitted as a state. 104 They called on Cowdery to accompany Babbitt, their congressional delegate, to\nWashington and help publicize their statehood aspirations and draft a memorial seeking the admission of Deseret\nas a free state. It is not known for sure if Cowdery received the First Presidency\u2019s request. 105 If he did, Oliver\nwould not have had the physical strength to travel since he was seriously weakened by recurring health problems.Around the rst of August, Cowdery suffered an attack of bilious fever and the chills. The fever, which Cowdery\ndescribed as the \u201cmost severe of any in my life,\u201d stirred his persistent lung problem. 106 From this time, in late\nsummer 1849, until his death a little more than six months later, his health deteriorated steadily. 107 He would not\nlive to go west, get some gold, start a fruit tree business, or serve the church as he so nobly wanted.\nIn spite of a diseased body, Cowdery\u2019s mind and spirit were vigorous and alert to the end. A few months before his\ndeath, Oliver received a visit from Jacob Gates, an old Mormon acquaintance from before his excommunication in\n1838. Gates, heading east on a mission to England, heard that his former priesthood leader was in poor health and\nstopped in Richmond to renew their friendship. 108 After conversing about troubled times in early church history,\nGates asked Cowdery about his testimony printed in the Book of Mormon. He wanted to know if the testimony\nwas based on a dream, the imagination of his mind, an illusion, or a myth. Jacob wanted the truth. As the account\ngoes, Oliver Cowdery got up from his resting place, retrieved a rst edition Book of Mormon, and read solemnly\nthe testimony. Turning to face Gates, he said,\nJacob, I want you to remember what I say to you. I am a dying man, and what would it pro t me to tell you\na lie? I know . . . that this Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God. My eyes saw, my\nears heard, and my understanding was touched, and I know that whereof I testi ed is true. It was no\ndream, no vain imagination of the mind\u2014it was real. 109\nOn 3 March 1850, the day Oliver Cowdery died at the Peter Whitmer Sr. home, he was surrounded by his wife;\ntheir only daughter, Maria; his brother-in-law, David Whitmer; Hiram Page, his nurse; others of the Whitmer\nfamily; his half-sister, Lucy; and her husband, Phineas Young. Oliver asked to be raised so he could speak. As he had\ndone hundreds of times before, he bore a resolute testimony of the Book of Mormon. Phineas reported that\nOliver, on his deathbed, con ded in him, \u201cThe[re] was no Salvation but in the valley and through the priesthood\nthere.\u201d 110 Thus ended the mortal life of the Second Elder of Mormonism.\nTo modern generations, Oliver\u2019s legacy lives on because of his strong character and integrity as a latter-day\nwitness of that ancient American scripture he assisted in bringing forth. Fellow Book of Mormon witness David\nWhitmer related that after Cowdery said his good-byes and bore his closing testimony, he \u201cdied the happiest man I\never saw. . . . [Oliver] said, \u2018Now I lay me down for the last time, I am going to my Savior,\u2019 and died immediately with\na smile on his face.\u201d 111\nNotes\nThis article would not have been possible without the support and encouragement of my mentor, Richard Lloyd\nAnderson. I appreciate his dedicated friendship and generous assistance but assume full responsibility for the\ninterpretations offered herein. In order to keep the length of this essay within reason, I have focused primarily on\nOliver Cowdery\u2019s feelings and views during his nal decade. My thanks to Larry Porter, Richard Cowan, Shane\nHeath, Stephanie Terry, and Gary Webb for reading and commenting on earlier versions of this paper.\n1. I have taken the position that Cowdery was rebaptized in Mosquito Creek (instead of Indian Creek or the\nMissouri River) based on the following data: (1) Cowdery\u2019s brother-in-law Phineas Young lived in Cartersville, a\nsettlement on the east side of Mosquito Creek; (2) Oliver Cowdery stayed with Phineas Young during all or most\nof his two-and-a-half month sojourn in western Iowa; (3) Cowdery\u2019s rebaptism took place a week after the\ncombined Pottawattamie High Council\u2014high priests meeting on 5 November 1848 that was held in the KanesvilleLog Tabernacle; and (4) eleven-year-old Seymour B. Young, Phineas Young\u2019s nephew, was also baptized near\nCartersville in late 1848. He related, \u201cJust near by the bank of the creek where the baptism occurred lived my\nuncle, Phineas H. Young. I returned to his home after baptism, and there I met with a man somewhat famous in the\nhistory of the Church, namely Oliver Cowdery.\u201d Conference Reports, April 1921, 114\u201415.\n2. Although no contemporary documentation exists for Cowdery\u2019s reordination, the action would be logical since\nCowdery had been excommunicated. Several early sources mention Oliver\u2019s reordination. See Brigham Young\u2019s\nremarks in the Sunday morning session of the October 1870 semi-annual general conference where he remarked,\n\u201cOliver Cowdery . . . returned, was baptised and ordained again went to visit his friends in Missouri, and died\u201d\n(Ogden Junction, 12 October 1870, emphasis added). See also statement by W. W. Blair in \u201c\u2018Mormonism\u2019\nReviewed,\u201d Saints\u2019 Herald 23/3 (1 February 1876): 74\u201475. Blair, a member of the RLDS rst presidency, wrote,\n\u201cWe have been informed by credible witnesses that in [1848], he [Oliver Cowdery] attended a conference at\nCarterville, a hamlet near Council Bluffs, Iowa, and was there re-baptized, and re-ordained to the of ce of an elder\u201d\n(emphasis added).\n3. President Cowdery had been at odds with Joseph Smith and other church leaders for months preceding his high\ncouncil trial. Cowdery\u2019s dif culties, although not enumerated at the time, centered principally on personal\nproblems between Joseph and himself and on \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201cprocedural\u201d differences. These dif culties\nreceived notice as far back as September 1837 when Joseph Smith wrote a letter to the church leaders in\nMissouri, which he dispatched by the hand of Thomas B. Marsh. Part of the Prophet\u2019s epistle reads, \u201cOliver\nCowdery has been in transgression, but as he is now chosen as one of the Presidents or Councilors I trust that he\nwill yet humble himself and magnify his calling, but if he should not, the Church will soon be under the necessity of\nraising their hands against him. Therefore pray for him.\u201d See Joseph Smith to John Corrill and the church in Zion, 4\nSeptember 1837, retained copy in \u201cScriptory Book of Joseph Smith Jr.\u201d (kept by George W.

The six charges sustained against Oliver Cowdery (quoted here with minor modernization) were (1) For stirring\nup the enemy to persecute the brethren by urging on vexatious lawsuits and thus distressing the innocent; (2) For\nseeking to destroy the character of President Joseph Smith Jr. by falsely insinuating that he was guilty of adultery;\n(3) For treating the church with contempt by not attending meetings; (4) For leaving the calling, in which God had\nappointed him, by Revelation, for the sake of lthy lucre, and turning to the practice of the Law; (5) For disgracing\nthe church by being connected in the \u2018Bogus\u2019 business as common report says; and (6) For dishonestly retaining\nnotes after they had been paid. It should be pointed out that the Far West Record reports that the fth charge\nlisted here was only sustained on circumstantial grounds. Seymour Brunson preferred the nine charges against\nOliver on 7 April 1838. For the entire list of nine charges, see Far West Record, 118\u201419.6. \u201cHistory of Tho[ma]s Baldwin Marsh,\u201d Deseret News, 24 March 1858, 18.\n7. Laura Pitkin to Heber C.

At the time this letter was\nwritten, Elder Kimball was serving with his fellow apostles on a mission in Great Britain. Laura Pitkin later became\na plural wife to Heber C. Kimball.\n8. According to William Lang, Oliver rst visited Tif n in the spring of 1840 where, on 12 May, he spoke to a large\ngathering of local Democratic supporters. Cowdery was, during that time, scouting out a location to practice law.\nLang mentions that Oliver moved to Tif n in the (late) fall of 1840. See William Lang, History of Seneca County\n(Spring eld, Ohio: Transcript Printing, 1880), 364\u201465, 387.\n9. Phineas served in this position until June 1843, when he was recalled to Nauvoo.

Snyder (also spelled Snider) was sent by revelation to England to raise money for the building of the Nauvoo\nHouse and Nauvoo Temple (see D&C 124:22, 62, 70, and uncanonized 22 December 1841 revelation, published\nin History of the Church, 4:483). He departed Nauvoo for England on 26 March 1842 (Jessee, Papers of Joseph\nSmith, 2:343\u201445, 356, 362, 373). On the return voyage from Liverpool, Elder Snyder had charge of a company of\n157 emigrating Saints on board the ship Henry. The voyage lasted six weeks, and during the last four weeks, the\nship was frequently stalled by lack of winds. Elder Snyder and the ship\u2019s commanding of cer, Captain Benjamin\nPierce, had several disagreements during the voyage. The Henry arrived in New Orleans by mid-November 1842,\nwhere Snyder was arrested. See Conway B.

Phelps, along with Cowdery, David and John Whitmer, Luke E. Johnson, and others, became disaffected during\nthe internal Mormon dif culties at Far West in 1838. In June 1840, W.\u00e2\u20ac\u201aW.

Phelps\u2019s letter to Cowdery has not been located.\nNear the time he wrote to Oliver, Phelps sent a letter to another disenfranchised elder, Warren Parrish. After\nencouraging Parrish to come and fellowship with the Saints in Nauvoo, Phelps noted the number of non-Mormon\nlawyers in the city and hinted that Parrish could come to Nauvoo as a \u201cMormon\u201d attorney. Perhaps Phelps, in his\nletter to Cowdery, made the same proposal to Oliver but obscured the meaning or was misunderstood. Phelps\nmentioned to Parrish that \u201cI want this letter to be an epistle general: as well to Zerrubbabel Snow, Esq. as you and\nOliver Cowdery, Esq., if you will give him a hint of it by writing.\u201d See transcription of Phelps to Parrish in Walter D.\nBowen, \u201cThe Versatile W.

Robinson\u2019s entry in the 1838\nScriptory Book (page 47) reveals his true feelings toward the dissenters:\nI would mention or notice something about O. Cowdery, David Whitmer, Lyman E. Johnson, and John\nWhitmer who being guilty of base iniquities and that too, manifest in the ages of all men, and being often\nentreated would continue in their course seeking the lives of the First Presidency and to overthrow the\nKingdom of God which they once testi ed of. Pres[iden]t Rigdon preached one Sabbath upon the salt that\nhad lost its savour that it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men,\nand the wicked ee when no man pursueth. These men took warning and soon they were seen bounding\nover the prairie like the scapegoat to carry off their own sins. We have not seen them since. Their\nin uence is gone and they are in a miserable condition. (Faulring, American Prophet\u2019s Record, 187, and\nJessee, Papers of Joseph Smith, 2:249)\n31. Phineas H.

In spite of some minor differences in details, the essence of these reports is that Oliver Cowdery learned\nabout plural marriage while serving as the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s assistant and that he (Cowdery) practiced it\nwithout the Prophet\u2019s consent during the 1830s. A sample of statements by early church leaders regarding Oliver\nCowdery and plural marriage include: Brigham Young, 26 August 1857, LDS Church Archives, quoted in Wilford\nWoodruff\u2019s Journal, 1833\u20141898, ed. Scott G. Kenney (Midvale, Utah: Signature Books, 1983\u201485), 5:84; Brigham\nYoung in Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 1857, 439 (based on Woodruff\u2019s journal entry with added detail),\nLDS Church Archives; Heber C. Kimball (comment made 24 May 1868) in \u201cRecord of the Provo Stake of Zion,\u201d\nLDS Church Archives; Brigham Young in Joseph F. Smith diary, 9 October 1869, LDS Church Archives; Brigham\nYoung in Charles Walker Diary, 26 July 1872, LDS Church Archives; Joseph F. Smith, 7 July 1878, in Journal of\nDiscourses, 20:29; George Q. Cannon in Juvenile Instructor 16 (15\u00e2\u20ac\u201aSeptember 1881): 206; and Joseph F. Smith\n(comment made 4 March 1883) in \u201cProvo Utah Central Stake, Historical Records and Minutes, 1877\u20141888,\u201d LDS\nChurch Archives. This episode of Cowdery\u2019s life has been examined recently by several scholars. Not all agree\nwhether Oliver practiced an early form of plural marriage. For instance, Richard S. Van Wagoner, in Mormon\nPolygamy: A History, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1989), 11, reported that Oliver Cowdery \u201cnever\nbecame reconciled to Mormon polygamy.\u201d I disagree with Van Wagoner\u2019s interpretation. I believe that evidence\nsuggests Cowdery believed in and practiced this Kirtland-form of plural marriage (1833\u201434), got in trouble for it\n(1834), and for many years (1835\u201448) was opposed to the practice. This opposition mellowed when he returned\nto the church in 1848. Nine days after arriving at Kanesville in October 1848, Oliver had a \u201clengthy and agreeable\ninterview\u201d with the presiding of cials at Council Bluffs\u2014Elders Orson Hyde and George A. Smith. During their\nevening discussion, Cowdery af rmed that he had come to \u201clisten to [their] counsel and would do as [they] told\nhim.\u201d He recognized the need to be rebaptized and bore sincere testimony that Joseph Smith had \u201cful lled his\nmission faithfully before God until death.\u201d Oliver assured Elders Hyde and Smith that he sought no position or\nof ce in the church; he only wanted to be \u201cone among us, and live with the Saints.\u201d At this point in 1848, it is\nreasonable to assume that Oliver Cowdery was, if he had not already been, made aware that plural marriage was\ncommonly practiced within Mormon society. Unfortunately we do not know Oliver\u2019s reaction, but until his death in\n1850, Cowdery was making serious plans to move to Utah. If his deteriorating health had not prevented him, he\nwould have come to Utah and served the church in whatever capacity they wanted him to serve. It is logical that if\nCowdery was as morally offended by the Saints\u2019 plural marriage relationship as Van Wagoner and others have\nsuggested, he would not have wanted to immigrate to Utah and live as \u201cone\u201d among them. During his \u201cinterview\u201d\nwith Elders Hyde and Smith, Oliver said that he \u201cwas determined to rise with the Church, and if it went down he\nwas willing to go down with it.\u201d See George A. Smith to Orson Pratt, 31 October postscript to 20 October 1848\nletter, in Millennial Star 11 (1 January 1849): 14; and Orson Hyde, George A.

Being frequently ill and impoverished, Cowdery was keenly aware of his limited ability to provide for\nhis wife and child. Oliver made frequent mention in his correspondences of his concern for his \u201csmall family\u201d and\ntheir temporal survival. He sensed from the reports he received about the Saints\u2019 destitute condition that if he\njoined with them he would be subjecting his family to unknown dangers.\n51. Cowdery\u2019s involvement was noticed in the Seneca Advertiser for 11 December 1846: \u201cThe editorial\nmanagement of the Advertiser will be entrusted to the hands of a capable friend, during the absence of the editor.\u201d\nTwo months later, when Breslin returned, he announced:\nThe Editor has returned to his post.\nIn looking over the columns of the Advertiser, published during our absence, we felt impelled to\ncongratulate our readers upon the interest and ability parted them by our friend, Mr. Cowdery, to whom\nwe entrusted the management of our paper.

He is wondering if he can do what being a priesthood holder will require of him. I had that worry when I was about 13 or 14.\nI had grown up in the mission field where there was only a tiny branch, which met in my home. Then my family moved to where there were stakes and large wards and chapels and quorums of boys who all seemed to know so much more than I did about what priesthood holders do. They had in that ward a complicated pattern for passing the sacrament. I felt almost certain that I would make a mistake when my turn to pass or prepare the sacrament came.\nIn my fear and desperation, I remember going outside the chapel to be alone. I was worried. I prayed for help and for some assurance that I would not fail in serving God in His priesthood.\nIt is now many years later. I have held the Melchizedek Priesthood for more than 50 years. But in the last few days I have prayed with that same pleading for help and assurance that I will not fail in the call which has come to me to serve in the First Presidency. Others seem so much more able to serve and so much better prepared. But as I prayed this time I think I could feel an answer that was probably sent to me outside the Yalecrest Ward chapel long ago. It is the same answer you can expect to get when you face a call to serve in the priesthood which seems beyond you.\nThe message may come in words to your mind or in a feeling or both. But it will include at least three things to give you assurance and guidance in what you must do in this seemingly overwhelming calling.\nFirst, the assurance will come from a memory of times Heavenly Father has helped you through dangers and difficulties. That\u2019s happened to me in the last few days.\nWhen I was young and still living in New Jersey, a large crowd of angry people gathered in front of our house. My mother went out to meet them, standing alone in this crowd of people who looked very dangerous to me. I couldn\u2019t hear what she said, but after a few minutes they went away peacefully. I still remember that I had seen a miracle.\nFrom when I was older, I have a more recent memory of a crowd of angry people I was called by the First Presidency to face who suddenly and inexplicably were touched by a spirit of calm and reconciliation.\nAnother time, I was sent to speak to leaders of churches in the United States and ministers of those churches who had met in Minneapolis to deal with the problem of competition among churches.\nWhen I arrived, I found that I was assigned to be a speaker. My subject was to be: Why there was a need for a restoration of the true Church through Joseph Smith. I was a last-minute substitute for Elder Neal A. Maxwell.\nWhen I arrived in the city the night before the meetings and looked at the program, I called President Hinckley. I told him that the meetings were to last three days, that many talks were to be given at the same time, that the crowd could choose which one to attend. I told him that I thought if I told the truth, I feared that no one would come to my second session and that I might be coming home very quickly. I asked him what he thought I should do. He said, \u201cUse your best judgment.\u201d\nI prayed through the night. Somewhere near dawn, I was sure I was to say about the Restoration not, \u201cThis is what we believe happened to Joseph Smith and why we believe it happened,\u201d but, \u201cThis is what happened to Joseph Smith, and this is why the Lord did it.\u201d In the nighttime I was given no assurance of the outcome, just a clear direction\u2014go forward.\nTo my amazement, after my talk the ministers lined up to speak to me. Every one of them, one after another coming to me, told essentially the same story. Each of them had met a member of the Church somewhere in their lives that they admired. Many of them said that they lived in a community where the stake president had come to the aid of not just his members but of the community in a disaster. They asked if I could take back their greeting and their thanks to people I not only didn\u2019t know but had no hope of ever meeting.\nBy the end of the three days of meetings, larger and larger crowds were coming to hear the message of the Restoration of the gospel and the true Church of Jesus Christ not because they believed the message but because they had seen goodness in people\u2019s lives\u2014the fruits of that restoration.\nAs I prayed in these last few nights, those and other memories flooded back with an assurance something like this: \u201cHaven\u2019t I always looked after you? Think of the times I have led you beside the still waters. Remember the times I have set a table before you in the presence of your enemies. Remember, and fear no evil.\u201d (See Psalm 23.)\nSo to the new deacons: remember. He has always taken care of you from your childhood. To the new quorum presidents: remember. To you fathers with children who are a challenge to you: remember, and have no fear. What is impossible for you is possible with God\u2019s help in His service. And even when you were very small and in the years since, He has with His power and His Spirit gone before your face and been on your left hand and on your right hand when you went in His service (see D&C 84:88). You can receive assurance that God will watch over you if you pray for it in faith. I know that.\nThe second part of the message you will receive as you pray for help in facing a hard assignment came to me very early Friday morning. I had prayed, as you will, about overwhelming inadequacies. The answer was very clear and very direct and really a rebuke as I prayed. \u201cForget yourself\u2014start praying about the people you are to serve.\u201d That does wonders, I can testify, to bring the Holy Ghost.\nBut be prepared to lose track of time as you pray. You will feel love for the people you are to serve. You will feel their needs, their hopes, their hurts, and those of their families. And as you pray, the circle will grow wider than you would imagine, to perhaps people not in your quorum or your family but to those they love across the world. When you forget yourself to pray for the circle of others, your service will be extended in your heart. It will change not only your service but your heart. That is because the Father and His Beloved Son, whom you are called to serve, know and love so many people your service will touch, however limited to a few it may seem to be to you.\nThe third and final message you can watch for when you pray for help in a hard priesthood assignment is this one\u2014I got this one as well\u2014go to work. Priesthood power is given you to bless others. And that always takes moving out and doing something, usually something hard to do. So you can expect, in addition to assurance of God\u2019s help and the command to forget yourself, the clear prompting by the Holy Ghost to go and do something which will bless someone\u2019s life. That may be as obvious as going prayerfully to visit a person or a family or a quorum member to whom you are assigned to serve. For a father it may be to correct one of his children.\nWhether what you do is to correct or to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will do it better if you remember what success will be. You are to help Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, make eternal life possible for those you serve. To do that, the Spirit must take a testimony down into their hearts. And that testimony has to lead them to choose to keep the commandments of God, whatever storms and temptations may come.\nWith that in mind, the Spirit will guide you in teaching and correcting with priesthood power. You will keep yourself clean so that you will teach with the Spirit. You will pray for the Spirit to tell you when to correct and how to correct and how to show an increase of love (see D&C 121:43\u201344). Whatever you do in your priesthood service can be guided and measured by how well it could or did help the person take a testimony of the truth down into his or her life and heart, enough for the Atonement to work and keep working.\nYou can get assurance in your service. You can forget yourself and begin to pray for and love those you are to serve. And you can choose what to do and measure success by the degree to which it changes the hearts of the people you serve.\nBut it is never going to be easy for you or for those you serve. There will always be pain in service and in the repentance necessary to bring the power of the Atonement to change hearts. That is in the nature of what you are called to do. Think of the Savior, whose service you are in. At what point in His mortal life can you see an instance when it was easy for Him? Did He ask easy things of His disciples then? Then why should it ever be easy in His service or for His disciples?\nThe reason for that is suggested by the phrase \u201ca broken heart,\u201d about which you have been taught so well today. The scriptures sometimes speak of people\u2019s hearts being softened, but more often the words describing the state we seek for ourselves and for those we serve are a \u201cbroken heart.\u201d This may help us accept that our call to serve and the need for the repentance we need and seek will not be easy. And it helps us understand better why testimony needs to go down into the hearts of our people. Faith that Jesus Christ atoned for their sins has to go down into the heart\u2014a broken heart.\nNow, tonight let us decide together what we are going to do. All of us, whatever our callings may be, face tasks that are beyond our own powers. I do and you do. That\u2019s true from the simple fact that success is to get testimony down into the hearts of people. We can\u2019t make that happen. Even God won\u2019t force that on anyone.\nSo success requires people we serve to choose to accept the testimony of the Spirit into their hearts. The Spirit is ready. But many people aren\u2019t ready to invite the Spirit. Our task, which is in our power, is to invite the Spirit into our lives so that people we serve will want to have the fruits of the Spirit in their lives\u2014the fruits that they can see in ours.\nThis leads me to some suggestions of what we can choose to do or not to do. Some things we can do invite the Spirit. Some force the Spirit to withdraw. You know that from your own experience.\nNo priesthood holder who wants to succeed will be careless about where his eyes may go. Choosing to look at images which incite lust will cause the Spirit to withdraw. You have been warned by Elder Clayton as well as you may ever be warned about the dangers of the Internet and the media in putting pornographic images before us. But immodesty is now so common that everyday life requires discipline\u2014a conscious choice not to linger watching whatever might create in us feelings which would repel the Spirit.\nThe same care is required in what we say. We cannot hope to speak for the Lord unless we are careful with our speech. Vulgarity and profanity offend the Spirit. Just as immodesty seems to be more common, so does vulgar and profane language. It used to be that only in certain places and with certain groups would we hear the name of the Lord taken in vain or hear vulgar words and crude humor. Now it seems to be everywhere and, for many, socially acceptable, where once it was not.\nYou can decide\u2014and you must\u2014to change what you say even when you can\u2019t control what others say. But I know from my own experience that even in such a terrible situation you can count on God\u2019s help. Years ago I was an air force officer serving for two years in an office with a marine colonel, an army colonel, and a grizzled navy commander. They had learned to speak in war and in peace in a way which offended me, and I know it repelled the Holy Ghost. I was at the time serving as a district missionary, trying in the evenings to go out to find people and teach them under the influence of the Holy Ghost. It was very hard. I was only a lieutenant. They were very senior to me. I had no way of changing their language. But I prayed for help. I don\u2019t know how God did it, but in time their language changed. Slowly the profanity disappeared and then the vulgarity. Only when they drank liquor did it come back, but that was in the evenings, so I could excuse myself for missionary work.\nYou can have memories like that to sustain your faith when life puts you in difficult places. God helps the faithful priesthood holder who decides to see and say no evil, even in a wicked world. It will not be easy. It never is. But you can have the promise fulfilled for you as I know that it can be for me: \u201cLet virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven\u201d (D&C 121:45).\nI testify that I know that you and I hold the priesthood of God and that He will answer our prayers with sweet assurance and with the help to serve Him better. I so promise you and testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nHenry\u00a0B. Eyring\nGod Helps the Faithful Priesthood Holder\n2007\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "When I received this call, I pleaded with Heavenly Father to help me know what the sisters in the Church needed. I received a strong witness that we, His daughters, need to know that He loves us. We need to know that He sees the good in us. Feeling His love encourages us to press forward, reassures us that we are His, and confirms to us that He cherishes us even when we stumble and experience temporary setbacks.\nI had this message confirmed when I bore my testimony in the Sunday afternoon session of general conference in April of 2002. That morning I was told that Elder David B. Haight might not be able to participate in the conference. If that happened, I would have five minutes to bear my testimony. I prayed extra hard for Elder Haight that day! Sunday morning I watched him come into the Conference Center, and I started to relax\u2014right up until the moment he exited during the congregational hymn. As I stood at the podium that afternoon, the teleprompter screen was blank! But the message that kept coming to my mind and heart was that women need to feel the Lord\u2019s love in their lives daily. It was the message I knew I needed to convey that day, and it continues to be our message.\nI have been humbled by your tender personal responses to this charge. Thank you for sharing how this message has blessed your life. Your words have confirmed that each one of us is entitled\u2014and needs\u2014to feel the Lord\u2019s love in her life daily.\nOur Heavenly Father loved us before we came to this earth. I know that He loves us, sisters, as does His Son, Jesus Christ. That love will never change\u2014it is constant. You can rely on it. We can trust it.\nJust as the motto of Relief Society reminds us that \u201ccharity never faileth,\u201d we must believe that the love of Christ will never fail us. All that we do in Relief Society should reflect the love of our Savior and the love of our Heavenly Father. This great love should be the source of our motivation to serve others. It must be both our point of origin and our destination!\nI know of a young mother with five little children who called an older sister, her valued mentor, and asked, \u201cCan we go on a hike?\u201d Her friend knew that meant she needed to talk. Halfway through an eight-mile loop, the young mother finally said, \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that Heavenly Father loves me; I\u2019ve made lots of mistakes in my life. I can\u2019t feel that I\u2019m worthy of His love; how can He possibly love me?\u201d Sisters, this was a woman who had made temple covenants and was active in the Church. And yet she still felt unworthy of His love. The older sister quickly responded, \u201cOf course He loves you. You\u2019re His daughter.\u201d\nDo we frequently reject the Lord\u2019s love that He pours out upon us in much more abundance than we are willing to receive? Do we think we have to be perfect in order to deserve His love? When we allow ourselves to feel \u201cencircled about eternally in the arms of his love,\u201d1 we feel safe, and we realize that we don\u2019t need to be immediately perfect. We must acknowledge that perfection is a process. This is a gospel of eternal progress, and we must remember to appreciate the journey. Eternal means \u201cwithout beginning or end,\u201d so the encircling of His love is there for us every day. Remember, it\u2019s constant\u2014even when we don\u2019t recognize it. I love Nephi\u2019s description of this great gift: \u201cThe love of God \u2026 sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things \u2026 and the most joyous to the soul.\u201d2 I testify that this is true.\nI know there may be some who have a difficult time imagining what His love feels like. Think of a mother with her newborn baby. The warmth, safety, cherishing, and peace of a mother\u2019s embrace can help us understand what it feels like to be encircled in the arms of His love. A young adult Relief Society sister wrote, \u201cOnly in the love of my mother do I come close to understanding the magnitude and power of the love of the Savior.\u201d\nMothers, can you see how essential you are in teaching this truth to your children? As you encircle your children with your love, they will catch glimpses of His love. President Gordon B. Hinckley urges us to \u201clove the Lord [our] God, and love His Son, and be ever grateful for Their love for us. Whenever other love fades, there will be that shining, transcendent, everlasting love of God for each of us and the love of His Son, who gave His life\u201d3 for us.\nA mother who knows her relationship with God helps her children to know Him and to be encircled by His love. I was touched by the comments a daughter shared at the funeral of her 100-year-old mother: \u201cWhen I was a teenager trying to plan my class schedule, I would come into the kitchen where Mother was ironing. I would present possible options for my studies. \u2026 She would listen to all of them. We would discuss the possibilities \u2026 and then she would say, \u2018OK, Cathy, have you prayed about it?\u2019 That was kind of embarrassing to me, and I would hesitate and then add, \u2018Do you have to pray about everything?\u2019 She answered simply, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d4\nThis mother listened. She shared her faith in the Lord; she set an example; she shared her expectations for her daughter to return continually to the Lord. As we approach the Lord, we feel His love draw us closer. Mothers, teach your children to always include the Lord in their lives, and help them to recognize His loving influence.\nMy mother and I received our patriarchal blessings together. I was 20, and Mother was 49. I will never forget that day\u2014how the patriarch placed his hands on Mother\u2019s head and told her how often her life had been spared through bouts of rheumatic fever, heart disease, and many other illnesses. He recounted her life, enumerating the times she had blessed others. He told her of things the Lord had in store for her and offered guidance as to what she needed to do. I knew my mother\u2019s life, and I listened as this patriarch, who was not acquainted with her, described her life. This experience was a witness to me that God lives, that He loves us, and that He knows us individually. I felt the Lord\u2019s love for my mother\u2014and for me\u2014on that memorable day.\nThe greatest evidence of our Savior\u2019s love for us is His Atonement. His love overflows with grace, patience, long-suffering, mercy, and forgiveness.\nNow, as grandmothers we have a sacred responsibility to encircle our grandchildren in love. When a three-year-old girl was being sassy, her grandmother instructed her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk that way to your grandmother, because we are going to be friends for millions and millions of years.\u201d Isn\u2019t being a grandmother the best? Remember, sisters, love and covenants bind us together as eternal families.\nThe Lord\u2019s love is often delivered through others as they respond to promptings of the Spirit. Are we hearing and following those promptings?\nBecause of financial struggles, one sister had to move from her beloved home and ward after living there for 22 years. That was painful. Of her first Sunday in her new ward, she said: \u201cI felt very alone, even though I knew a few people. I was one of the first to Relief Society that morning. I sat there and watched the sisters file in and take their seats. They all seemed to need their own row, not just their own seat. They didn\u2019t sit by each other and they didn\u2019t sit by me. I felt like an island.\u201d Sisters, why do we do that to each other?! The sister continued: \u201cThen Lisa came in. Her face lit up when she saw me and she charged over to me, popped down beside me, put her arm around me and gave me a big hug. It\u2019s amazing how much a small gesture like that can mean. Her warmth\u201d\u2014and I would add, her love\u2014\u201cwashed away my loneliness.\u201d\nI fear sometimes we see the Lord\u2019s love only in the big events of our lives; we must also see His love in the smallest of things. Don\u2019t underestimate your ability to share His love through a simple, genuine gesture such as sitting next to another sister and making her feel welcome.\nDo you feel the Lord\u2019s love in your life? How I feel His love may be different from how you experience it. The key is to come to understand how you feel that love. And once you\u2019ve felt it, be willing to share it.\nAs a presidency we visited the devastated Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. One evening at a fireside I stood at the pulpit and felt prompted that every sister in attendance needed someone to literally reach out and strengthen her. After the meeting, Sister Hughes, Sister Pingree, and I each stood by a different door and hugged every sister as she exited. We simply wanted to express our love for them. To any of those sisters who are listening tonight, we left your chapel feeling renewed because of the love of God that you shared with us. Thank you for taking care of each other\u2014and the three of us!\nIn my morning prayers I ask Heavenly Father to fill me with His love so that I can do His work with more heart. I know that I have been blessed because of this daily petition. As Relief Society sisters, we must strive to manifest the love of Christ, who always sought to please His Father by doing His will. Sisters, we must make every effort to follow His supreme example\u2014to demonstrate such love through our thoughts, our speech, our actions\u2014in all the things we do and are. We must not allow pride or vanity, selfishness or personal agendas to displace our reaching out to others in love. Quite simply and profoundly, we must first allow ourselves to be encircled by God\u2019s love. We do this best by embracing the Savior\u2019s eternal Atonement. Then we can expand that circle to include our family and all others. Such a circle is indeed heaven.\nMy dear sisters, may the Lord bless you to feel His love daily as you keep your covenants, exercise charity, and strengthen families. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBonnie D. Parkin\nEternally Encircled in His Love\n2006\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "The dignity of the proceedings of this solemn assembly causes me to have the comforting assurance that the Lord, in his goodness, continues to provide inspired leadership and divine guidance to his church, the purpose of which is to build his kingdom upon the earth and serve his children. His church extends the invitation to all who so desire to partake of the power of the gospel, which will lift an individual out of oblivion and, in so doing, will give a feeling of satisfaction and happiness not to be found elsewhere. It provides the sources of control for self-improvement, a stable character, and a truly successful life.\nWho is there who has reached that point in life where he can afford to allow himself to stop growing or to stop improving? Although I never had the privilege of meeting her, I am told that my wife\u2019s mother often repeated the adage to her children: \u201cIf you consider yourself a nobody and do nothing to improve yourself to become a somebody, you truly will end up being a nobody.\u201d She, no doubt, understood the power and capacity of every soul for self-improvement.\nIt is highly doubtful that there is even one soul upon the earth, regardless of station or age, who does not have ample room for personal growth and improvement. Quoting the words of one of the Lord\u2019s prophets: \u201cIf we are no better tomorrow than we are today, we are not very useful.\u201d (David O. McKay, Pathways to Happiness [Bookcraft, 1957], p. 292.)\nThe sad part of humanity seems to be the utter lack of desire, in the lives of many, to really do something about enlarging the vistas of their existence. A distinguished doctor made the observation that \u201cfor the great majority of people, the good life is identical with trivial entertainment, cheap music, superficial writing, and an unending stream of visual trash. Their life is divorced from an enthusiastic faith in the future. It is focused on immediate pleasures sustained by a simplification of the grave problems pressing upon them.\u201d (Dr. E. A. Gutkind, Quote\u2014the Weekly Digest, vol. 51, no. 4, quote 32.)\nRather than accepting the challenge to change and grow, this type of person seemingly refuses to recognize the need to constructively reorganize portions of his life. One wonders, will the time ever come that will cause a reflection back on their lives? If so, their reaction could very well be as is expressed in a newspaper cartoon, under the heading \u201cZiggy,\u201d which said: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a disappointment, after reflecting on your life, to finally come face-to-face with yourself in a mud puddle.\u201d\nListening to a commentator recently, I was impressed by a related idea. His comments included the following:\n\u201cLin Yutang, the famous Chinese philosopher, has written: \u2018We do not know a nation until we know its pleasures of life, just as we do not know a man until we know how he spends his leisure. It is when a man ceases to do the things he has to do, and does the things he likes to do, that the character is revealed. It is when the repressions of society and business are gone and when the goads of money and fame and ambition are lifted, and a man\u2019s spirit wanders where it listeth, that we see the inner man, his real self.\u2019\u201d\nThen he continued: \u201cHave you ever thought much about that? Your leisure gives you away. I used to know a man who was head of a very large commercial empire. Beginning with nothing but ambition, he became a multimillionaire and, finally, retired as head of his far-flung company. He bought a large and magnificent yacht with which to cruise the world. And do you know what he did with his free time? He read salacious paperbacks and got falling-down drunk and had to be carried to bed, unconscious, every night. He\u2019s dead now. His leisure gave him away. There was nothing there \u2026 just nothing at all. He was a one idea man. Once he was away from that idea, he was a lost child in the wilderness. He didn\u2019t enjoy his yacht \u2026 travel meant nothing to him. He was a pitiful, unhappy cypher. Not because he was rich \u2026 there are thousands, millions just like him in every walk of life. It was just that his millions, which gave him access to the whole world, were worthless to him and accentuated his nothingness.\u201d\nThen the commentator asked the question: \u201cWhat do you do with your leisure time? It\u2019s a good idea to examine carefully this important segment of your life. It exposes the real person\u2014but not the finished person. We can change. \u2026\u201d (Earl Nightingale, \u201cOur Changing World,\u201d No. 2459. Used by permission.)\nChange is what it will take to bring any individual out of the dilemma of living with principles of error. I believe the greatest force in the world to cause such a change is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul experienced one of the greatest such changes that took place in any man, and he concluded: \u201cFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. \u2026\u201d (Rom. 1:16.)\nThe fourth Article of Faith reads: \u201cWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.\u201d [A of F 1:4.] As we briefly consider each of these principles, we will be aware of the power embodied in each of them.\nFaith is a principle of power. It is the cause of action. A prime example was taught by the Savior as we read in the seventeenth chapter of Matthew:\n\u201cAnd when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,\n\u201cLord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.\n\u201cAnd I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.\n\u201cAnd Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.\n\u201cThen came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?\n\u201cAnd Jesus said unto them, because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\n\u201cHowbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.\u201d (Matt. 17:14\u201316, 18\u201320.)\nThe evidence of the power of faith is clearly defined by the Savior. Faith in God will cause the miracle of change and set the course of action on the true purpose of life.\nRepentance follows faith as naturally as the day follows dawn. The poet writes: \u201cThe morning breaks, the shadows flee.\u201d (Hymns, no. 269.) Repentance is the very essence of change; it embodies the powerful principle of obedience to God\u2019s law and discipline of self. When applied to our lives, it provides a cleansing joy which surges through us.\nIt has been said: \u201cDisgrace clings to no man after repenting, any more than feet defiled with mud of the world, come yet soiled and polluted from the cleansing bath.\u201d (Spurgeon.) King Benjamin gives further emphasis to this thought:\n\u201cAnd again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.\n\u201cAnd behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in knowledge of the glory of him that created you. \u2026\u201d (Mosiah 4:10, 12.)\nBaptism requires obedience to the law of God. The divine fiat has been to call all men to repent and be baptized. Baptism is a companion to repentance. It is a principle and an ordinance of the gospel, and when complied with, it is the power of entering into the kingdom of God on earth. Jesus complied with this ordinance to fulfill all righteousness. The prophet Nephi said:\n\u201cAnd now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!\u201d (2 Ne. 31:5.)\nThe efficacy of the ordinance of baptism is unquestionable as it cleanses the reborn person.\nBaptism prepares the individual to receive the rebirth of the spirit, the laying on of hands, for the gift of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Fielding Smith brings to mind these words from the Prophet Joseph Smith:\n\u201cThere is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him. \u2026\u201d President Smith says further: \u201cIt mattereth not whether we live long or short on the earth after we come to a knowledge of these principles and obey them unto the end.\u201d (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith [Deseret Book, 1961], p. 199.)\nIn these principles we find the unfailing power to change. As to the effective use of our leisure time, we have, in the gospel, unnumbered opportunities. As one acquires knowledge of the gospel principles and pursues his course, he can successfully apply those principles to his individual circumstances, whether his position be one of great or meager possessions; whether it be early in life, during his economic production period, or in retirement. The gospel is meant to temper life and to bring it into true balance and fruition.\nThe Lord has decreed that \u201cthe Church hath need of every member.\u201d (See D&C 84:110.) This implies development of its members by participation in the programmed activities of children and youth, filling the numerous teaching opportunities, administration assignments, fulfillment of member duties, the fulfillment of priesthood duties, not forgetting to visit the homes of members (which, until this day, has not been attended to as the Lord directed), searching out the records of ancestors, and temple participation, all of which are only part of the never-ending list of activities with which to fill our leisure hours.\nThe individual power is attested to in this scripture: \u201cVerily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.\u201d (D&C 58:27\u201328.)\nAs we consider the aspects of growth and achievement, the word success obviously comes to the fore\u2014success as it applies in terms of the world. Success or failure can carry most of us either to the peaks of happiness or to the depths of despair. People will do almost anything to keep from being branded a failure.\nIf a man achieves worldly success and does not blend into his life a program of self-improvement to bring about a sensible balance, he no doubt will end up as a failure. He may win the honor of men, but what about his salvation\u2014his eternal future? Think back on the example of the man with the yacht. Was he successful? Worldly-wise, yes! But when it comes to the things that count, wasn\u2019t he more like the man who \u201cspent all his life letting down empty buckets into empty wells; and he is frittering away his age in trying to draw them up again\u201d? (Sydney Smith in John Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations, p. 523.) Such people seek fulfillment and meaning in their lives but are unable to find it, because they themselves have misplaced their values.\nRecently at a stake priesthood meeting I was greeted by two good convert brethren from the Netherlands, one of whom I like to think I had some participation in his conversion. I turned to him and asked: \u201cHave you ever been sorry for having joined the Church?\u201d His eyes brightened, and he responded with happy enthusiasm, saying, \u201cNo, never!\u201d\nHere, in my opinion, was a successful man. No doubt he had many vicissitudes in his life. His worldly possessions were probably minimal, but his good works\u2014treasures in heaven\u2014are innumerable. Here is evidence of just one of the thousands\u2014millions\u2014who have had similar experiences of becoming a \u201csomebody.\u201d\nAnd I ask you, brethren, sisters, where would we be, where would you be, where would I be, if it were not for the power of the gospel of Christ? I bear witness to its power and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\nJohn H. Vandenberg\nBecoming a Somebody\n1972\nFriday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "The Tabernacle Choir has sung \u201cThe Morning Breaks.\u201d I think I should like to use those marvelous words written by Parley P. Pratt as something of a theme:\nThe morning breaks; the shadows flee;\nLo, Zion\u2019s standard is unfurled!\nThe dawning of a brighter day\nMajestic rises on the world.\nThe clouds of error disappear\nBefore the rays of truth divine;\nThe glory bursting from afar\nWide o\u2019er the nations soon will shine.\nI greet you with appreciation for your love for the Lord and for your loyalty to his great cause.\nI see the fruits of your faith, and I am grateful. I thank you for the energy you put into this work. I know that at times it feels burdensome. Some of it may appear unnecessary. But out of effort and labor comes strength, and out of service comes gladness.\nI thank you for your faith in the payment of your tithes and offerings. You are making possible the growth and strengthening of this work across the world. But you do not need thanks. Every man and woman who pays his or her honest tithing has a testimony of the blessings that come therefrom. He or she can bear witness that the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours out blessings as he has promised. (See Mal. 3:10.)\nI give you the assurance, my brothers and sisters, that the work is moving forward. Wherever it is established in more than eighty nations, it is growing in strength. The faith of the people is increasing, as reflected in their increased activity. The missionary work continues to flourish. Our young men and women continue to leave their homes to go into the world to bear witness of the Savior and of the restoration of his eternal gospel in this the dispensation of the fulness of times. (See D&C 124:41.) The work of salvation for the dead, through the vast genealogical program of the Church and the selfless labor of love that goes on in the temples, is moving at a pace never previously known.\nOur people are more faithful in attendance at their meetings, and since our last conference a very substantial number of them have had opportunity to demonstrate their love for neighbor as well as for God. In the floods which we have experienced in this area, there has been an unexcelled expression of neighborliness and Christian service. A woman who was not a member of the Church was interviewed on television and said, \u201cI am not a Mormon, but I have come to know who my bishop is.\u201d She went on to speak with unrestrained appreciation for her neighbors, who, almost entirely Latter-day Saints, had been as generous in their help toward her as they had been in their help toward one another. There is a stake not far from here where the members of each ward undertook the repair or replacement of a home damaged or lost in the flood. Hundreds of thousands of sandbags were filled and put in place. There were, of course, those not of the Church doing likewise, but all concerned have spoken with high praise for the Church organization which was able to muster forces so rapidly and so effectively.\nHelp in very substantial quantities was sent to the people of Tonga, following a wild typhoon that ripped apart homes and farms. Both members and nonmembers were blessed by that assistance.\nLatter-day Saints in Brazil came to the aid of their countrymen, both Mormon and non-Mormon, who suffered the loss of homes and crops when terrible floods ravaged the vast southern area of that nation.\nAgain through the Welfare Program, and the cooperation of the Kaiser Aluminum Company, who furnished transportation, we were able to send substantial supplies of food and medicine to rescue many of the starving people of Ghana in Africa. Lives, not a few, were literally saved by this assistance.\nI do not mention these efforts in a spirit of boasting, but only to express gratitude to the Lord for the means and the resources and the will of our people to be helpful in times of crisis.\nFunds for these works of mercy have come largely from fast offerings. Despite the increased needs to meet such disasters, as well as aggravated problems incident to the present economy, fastoffering contributions have kept pace. Thank you for this marvelous expression of faith as you have gone without meals yourselves to help those in distress.\nI report also the dedication of four new temples since June of this year. For the benefit of any listening who may not be members of the Church, I should explain that a temple occupies a unique and peculiar place in our theology. It is not a house of public worship, of which we now have many thousands across the world. Temples, on the other hand, are dedicated as special houses of God, in which are performed some of the most sacred and elevating ordinances associated with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nIn June we dedicated a new temple in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the culmination of a dream that began a century and more ago when, in the days of the poverty of our people, missionaries were first sent to the southern states. A few accepted their testimony, but many more rose in bitterness against them. These early missionaries endured much persecution. Some were stripped and beaten; some were murdered by hateful enemies. But with faith they persevered. Eventually, thousands upon thousands joined the Church, and today the work is strong and growing in that beautiful part of the nation where we now have hundreds of faithful congregations of Latter-day Saints.\nOn the occasion of the Atlanta Temple dedication, the testimonies of the people\u2014those spoken and those expressed in tears of gratitude\u2014together with their songs of thanksgiving, all bore witness to the strength of their faith and their love for God.\nIn August we were in Samoa and Tonga for temple dedications. Again our hearts were lifted by the outpouring of the Christlike love we experienced and witnessed among the wonderful Saints of Polynesia. Through ancient prophets the Lord promised that in the latter days he would remember his people upon the isles of the sea. We have witnessed a marvelous fulfillment of these promises where today, among these loving and gracious people, we have scores of congregations, strong and flourishing schools to bless them with the benefits of education, and now beautiful temples of the Lord in which they may receive blessings to be found nowhere else.\nOnly a fortnight ago we were in Santiago, Chile, for the dedication of another beautiful temple. For me it was a miracle to be with more than 15,000 Latter-day Saints who assembled for these dedicatory services which extended over a period of three days. The nation of Chile is 2,700 miles long, and our faithful people gathered from such distant cities as Arica in the far north and Punta Arenas in the far south to rejoice over the marvelous blessing that had come to them in the erection and dedication of this sacred house of God.\nAmong them were Brother and Sister Ricardo Garcia, the first to be baptized when missionaries were sent to Chile in 1956. Only twenty-seven years later, there are more than 140,000 members of the Church in that nation.\nFor those of us favored to attend these dedicatory services, there has come a great refreshing of our faith and an increased affection for our brethren and sisters who love the Lord and walk with loyalty to him and his commandments.\nI recently had the opportunity of meeting with 14,000 seminary and institute students assembled in the Long Beach Convention Center. They had gathered from various areas of Southern California, handsome young men and beautiful young women. Most are high school students who meet five days each week for a seminary class at 6:15 in the morning, which is held in a Church building near the school under the direction of a dedicated and able teacher. On my way home from Chile, I met in Detroit with another group of these students at 6:15 in the morning.\nThese are bright and gifted and attractive youth. One cannot look into their faces and have any doubt concerning the future of this work. They are part of a marvelous generation whose numbers are constantly growing and whose faith is infectious.\nThey are to be found not only in the areas I have mentioned but wherever our work is established. They are the certain promise of the future of the Church and of its growing strength and the fulfilling of its mission. Furthermore, they will bless the nations and the lands of which they are a part, for they are young men and women with ambition for education. They believe in the cultivation of the mind, of the development of their skills, of the need to master new technologies, to serve in the world of work into which they will move.\nThey are young men and women of virtue and sobriety who have been reared to believe that our bodies are the temples of the Spirit of God and that we cannot defile these bodies without affronting him who is our creator.\nThey are the young men and women of faith who have been schooled in the scriptures. They know the Old Testament and the great characters who march through its pages. They are familiar with the New Testament and have developed a love for the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. Their faith in him has been reaffirmed and strengthened as they have studied that marvelous testament of the New World, the Book of Mormon. They are familiar with the word of God as it has come through modern revelation. They are students who are acquiring both secular and religious education, learning by study and also by faith. They are examples of the power of that first great principle, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe history of this Church is a history of the expression of such faith. It began with a farm boy in the year 1820 when he read that great promise set forth in the Epistle of James:\n\u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\u201cBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\u201d (James 1:5\u20136.)\nIt was faith, the simple faith of a fourteen-year-old boy, that took him into the woods that spring morning. It was faith that took him to his knees in pleading for understanding. The marvelous fruit of that faith was a vision glorious and beautiful, of which this great work is but the extended shadow.\nIt was by faith that he kept himself worthy of the remarkable manifestations which followed in bringing to the earth the keys, the authority, the power to reestablish the Church of Jesus Christ in these latter days. It was by faith that this marvelous record of ancient peoples, this testament which we call the Book of Mormon, was brought forth by the gift and power of God \u201cto the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.\u201d It was by faith that a small band of early converts, notwithstanding the very powers of hell brought against them, strengthened and sustained one another, left home and family to spread the word, moved from New York to Ohio and from Ohio to Missouri and from Missouri to Illinois in their search for peace and freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience.\nIt was through the eyes of faith that they saw a city beautiful when first they walked across the swamps of Commerce, Illinois. With the conviction that faith without works is dead, they drained that swampland, they platted a city, they built substantial homes and houses for worship and education and, crowning all, a magnificent temple, then the finest building in all of Illinois.\nAgain came persecution, with profane and murderous mobs. Their prophet was killed. Their dreams were shattered. Again it was by faith that they pulled themselves together under the pattern he had previously drawn and organized themselves for another exodus.\nWith tears and aching hearts they left their comfortable homes and their workshops. They looked back upon their sacred temple, and then with faith turned their eyes to the West, to the unknown and to the uncharted, and while the snows of winter fell upon them, they crossed the Mississippi that February of 1846 and plowed their muddy way over the Iowa prairie.\nWith faith they established Winter Quarters on the Missouri. Hundreds died as plague and dysentery and black canker cut them down. But faith sustained those who survived. They buried their loved ones there on a bluff above the river, and in the spring of 1847 they started west, moving by faith up the Elkhorn and beside the Platte toward the mountains of the West.\nIt was by faith that Brigham Young looked over this valley, then hot and barren, and declared, \u201cThis is the place.\u201d Again by faith, four days later, he touched his cane to the ground a few hundred feet east of where I stand and said, \u201cHere will be the temple of our God.\u201d The magnificent and sacred house of the Lord to the east of this Tabernacle is a testimony of faith, not only of the faith of those who built it but of the faith of those who now use it in a great selfless labor of love.\nWrote Paul to the Hebrews, \u201cNow faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d (Heb. 11:1.) All of the great accomplishments of which I have spoken were once only \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d But with vision, with labor, and with confidence in the power of God working through them, they brought their faith to reality.\nBehind us is a glorious history. It is bespangled with heroism, tenacity to principle, and unflagging fidelity. It is the product of faith. Before us is a great future. It begins today. We cannot pause. We cannot slow down. We cannot slacken our pace or shorten our stride.\nIn a dark period of our history, when enemies were throwing accusations against the Church, the First Presidency issued a proclamation to the world in which they set forth the dimensions of this work. Said they: \u201cOur motives are not selfish; our purposes not petty and earth-bound; we contemplate the human race\u2014past, present, and yet to come\u2014as immortal beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor; and to this work, broad as eternity and deep as the love of God, we devote ourselves, now, and forever.\u201d (The First Presidency, 26 March 1907.)\nWith faith we must go forward toward the fulfillment of that commitment. We must ever keep before us the big picture, while not neglecting the details. That large picture is a portrayal of the whole broad mission of the Church; but it is painted one brush stroke at a time through the lives of all members, the composite of whose activities becomes the Church at work.\nEach of us, therefore, is important. Each is a brush stroke, as it were, on the mural of this vast panorama of the kingdom of God. If there are blanks, if there are distortions, if there are off-color areas, then the picture is defective to all who look upon it.\nShall any of us say that with faith we cannot do better than we are now doing?\nThere is no obstacle too great, no challenge too difficult, that we cannot meet with faith. We live in a world where the standards of the gospel are challenged, where they are ridiculed, where sacred things are mocked. Shall we compromise? Shall we revile those who speak ungraciously of us?\nIn a more troubled day, the Lord said to Thomas B. Marsh:\n\u201cBe patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness, and be steadfast. \u2026\n\u201cGo your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go. \u2026\n\u201cBe faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of the Father.\u201d (D&C 31:9, 11, 13.)\nSaid the Savior to his disciples, \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d (Matt. 5:48.)\nThis is the commandment which is before us. Regrettably we have not reached perfection. We have a great distance to go. We must cultivate the faith to reform our lives, commencing where we are weak and moving on from there in our work of self-correction, thus gradually and consistently growing in strength to live more nearly as we should.\nWith faith we can rise above those negative elements in our lives which constantly pull us down. With effort we can develop the capacity to subdue those impulses which lead to degrading and evil actions.\nWith faith we can school our appetites.\nWe can reach out to those whose faith has grown cold and warm them by our own faith.\nLet us never forget, my brethren and sisters, that each of us is a part of the whole and that what we do mars or beautifies the magnificent panorama of the kingdom of God.\nAs our fathers labored in faith with a moving vision of the destiny of this work, even so can we. There is so much to be done, so much improvement to be made, but we can do it, walking in faith.\n\u201cIf ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\u201d (Matt. 17:20; italics added.)\nSo declared the Lord.\nGod grant us faith, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon B. Hinckley\nGod Grant Us Faith\n1983\nSunday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I look forward each month to the arrival of this wonderful magazine, the Ensign. It fortifies me with messages from the First Presidency, which are included in each issue. The August issue of the Ensign and Liahona brought with it a challenge from President Hinckley to read or reread the Book of Mormon before the end of the year.\nWhy does President Hinckley believe reading the Book of Mormon will be so beneficial to each of us? He states:\n\u201cIts appeal is as timeless as truth, as universal as mankind. It is the only book that contains within its covers a promise that by divine power the reader may know with certainty of its truth.\n\u201cIts origin is miraculous; when the story of that origin is first told to one unfamiliar with it, it is almost unbelievable. But the book is here to be felt and handled and read. No one can dispute its presence. \u2026\n\u201cNo other written testament so clearly illustrates the fact that when men [and women] and nations walk in the fear of God and in obedience to His commandments, they prosper and grow, but when they disregard Him and His word, there comes a decay that, unless arrested by righteousness, leads to impotence and death\u201d (\u201cA Testimony Vibrant and True,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, Aug. 2005, 4\u20135).\nWhy is the reading of the Book of Mormon so important to us today? It is because the major writers of the Book of Mormon fully understood that their writings were primarily for the people of a future generation rather than for the people of their own generation. Moroni wrote to our generation, \u201cI speak unto you as if ye were present\u201d (Morm. 8:35). The prophet Nephi stated:\n\u201cWherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand\u201d (2 Ne. 25:21).\nThe Book of Mormon is a voice of warning to this generation. See how vividly it describes conditions on the earth today:\n\u201cAnd no one need say [these records] shall not come, for they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead.\n\u201cAnd it shall come in a day when the blood of saints shall cry unto the Lord, because of secret combinations and the works of darkness.\n\u201cYea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches.\n\u201cYea, it shall come in a day when there shall be heard of fires, and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;\n\u201cAnd there shall also be heard of wars, rumors of wars, and earthquakes in divers places.\n\u201cYea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity\u201d (Morm. 8:26\u201331).\nPresident Ezra Taft Benson reaffirmed the fact that the Book of Mormon is of particular value to our time when he said:\n\u201cThe Book of Mormon was written for us today. God is the author of the book. It is a record of a fallen people, compiled by inspired men for our blessing today. Those people never had the book\u2014it was meant for us. Mormon, the ancient prophet after whom the book is named, abridged centuries of records. God, who knows the end from the beginning, told him what to include in his abridgment that we would need for our day\u201d (\u201cThe Book of Mormon Is the Word of God,\u201d Ensign, May 1975, 63).\nHow often we read the record primarily as a history of a fallen people, failing to remember that it was compiled by inspired prophets for the purpose of helping us come unto Christ. The major writers of the Book of Mormon did not intend it to be a history book at all. In fact, Jacob said that his brother Nephi commanded him that he \u201cshould not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people\u201d (Jacob 1:2).\nEach time we read the book we should probably ask ourselves: \u201cWhy did these writers choose these particular stories or events to include in the record? What value are they for us today?\u201d\nAmong the lessons we learn from the Book of Mormon are the cause and effect of war and under what conditions it is justified. It tells of evils and dangers of secret combinations, which are built up to get power and gain over the people. It tells of the reality of Satan and gives an indication of some of the methods he uses. It advises us on the proper use of wealth. It tells us of the plain and precious truths of the gospel and the reality and divinity of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice for all mankind. It informs us of the gathering of the house of Israel in the last days. It tells us of the purpose and principles of missionary work. It warns us against pride, indifference, procrastination, the dangers of false traditions, hypocrisy, and unchastity.\nNow it is up to us to study the Book of Mormon and learn of its principles and apply them in our lives.\nThe Book of Mormon begins with a great story on the importance of families having and using the scriptures. Lehi, a prophet-father, was warned that there were people who were seeking to take away his life because of his declarations concerning their wickedness. He was instructed to take his family and flee.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness\u201d (1 Ne. 2:4).\nAfter journeying some distance, Lehi had a dream in which the Lord said that they should not journey farther without returning to Jerusalem and obtaining the record of their fathers which was engraven on plates of brass. These plates also contained the words of the prophets and commandments of the Lord. The assignment was given to Lehi\u2019s four sons to make the journey back to obtain the record.\nUpon arriving at Jerusalem, they cast lots to decide who would go to the house of Laban and ask for the brass plates. The lot fell to Laman. He approached Laban, \u201cand behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee\u201d (1 Ne. 3:13). Laman escaped with his life but without the brass plates.\nOne thing that strikes me about this first attempt is that the brothers did not seem to have a good plan. This teaches us an important lesson that we can apply to our study of the scriptures. Let us show our commitment to reading the Book of Mormon by approaching our study with a specific plan.\nIn his article in the Ensign and Liahona, President Hinckley issued \u201ca challenge to members of the Church throughout the world and to our friends everywhere to read or reread the Book of Mormon.\u201d Then he offered us a plan to accomplish the challenge: \u201cIf you will read a bit more than one and one-half chapters a day, you will be able to finish the book before the end of this year\u201d (Liahona and Ensign, Aug. 2005, 6). August and September are now past history. According to President Hinckley\u2019s plan, we should be reading now in the book of Alma\u2014somewhere between chapters 4 and 12. Are you ahead of schedule or behind?\nWhen the first attempt to get the brass plates failed, Nephi\u2019s brothers wanted to give up and return to their family in the wilderness. But Nephi encouraged them to keep trying and proposed another approach to obtain the record: \u201cLet us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father\u2019s inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord. \u2026\n\u201cAnd it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records \u2026, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things\u201d (1 Ne. 3:16, 24).\nNephi\u2019s example teaches us that the blessings of the scriptures are far more valuable than property and other worldly things. Pursuing the things of the world can sometimes give us momentary pleasures but not lasting joy and happiness. When we seek after the things of the Spirit, the rewards are eternal and will bring us the satisfaction we seek through this mortal experience.\nPresident Hinckley has encouraged us to read the Book of Mormon to lift us above the things of the world, to enjoy the things of the Lord. He said, \u201cWithout reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God\u201d (Liahona and Ensign, Aug. 2005, 6). These blessings are far more valuable than material possessions.\nWhen Nephi and his brothers offered to exchange their wealth for the brass plates, Laban stole their property and tried to take their lives. Thoroughly discouraged after yet another failed attempt, Laman and Lemuel again wanted to give up on what they felt was an impossible task. Nephi, however, was unwavering in his commitment to obey the Lord\u2019s commandments. He reasoned with his brothers this way: \u201cLet us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?\u201d (1 Ne. 4:1).\nApproaching the assignment with faith in the Lord brought the desired result. As Nephi went forward to obtain the record, being led by the Spirit, Laban was delivered into his hands. Through his faith and obedience, Nephi secured for himself and his family the blessings of having the scriptures. Now, with the brass plates in their possession, Nephi and his brothers could return to their father in the wilderness and continue their journey.\nIf we will approach President Hinckley\u2019s challenge with faith, we have the sure promise of our prophet of the blessings we will receive resulting from our study of the Book of Mormon. We will find, as Nephi and his family did, that the scriptures are \u201cdesirable; yea, even of great worth unto us\u201d (1 Ne. 5:21). We can also receive the blessing Moroni promised as he closed his writings of the Book of Mormon:\n\u201cYea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God\u201d (Moro. 10:32).\nThis is the year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon provides convincing evidence of the Prophet Joseph\u2019s ministry and of the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ. President Hinckley, in the last general conference in April, said this about the Book of Mormon: \u201cIt is a tangible thing that can be handled, that can be read, that can be tested. \u2026 I would think that the whole Christian world would reach out and welcome it and embrace it as a vibrant testimony. It represents another great and basic contribution which came as a revelation to the Prophet [Joseph]\u201d (\u201cThe Great Things Which God Has Revealed,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, May 2005, 82).\nI pray that each of us will read the Book of Mormon by the end of the year in response to the challenge of our current prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, to honor the prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. May we have a plan that we will follow in faith to taste and be filled with that which is of infinite and eternal value, even the word of God found in the Book of Mormon, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nL. Tom Perry\nBlessings Resulting from Reading the Book of Mormon\n2005\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "Some years ago, while I was serving as the mission president in Portugal, several of our missionaries introduced me to their shoeshine man. Their shoes looked so good that I was anxious to meet the man that could put such a shine on missionaries\u2019 shoes. Even though he had not chosen to listen to the missionaries\u2019 message, I considered the shoeshine man my friend, and we visited while he was busy shining my shoes. He indicated that his wife had died, that he had no family, and that about the only pleasure he had in life was seeing people walk away happy with the shoes he had just shined.\nHis place of business was on the curbside of a small square on a busy street in downtown Lisbon. His stand seemed to have all that was necessary. It consisted of a short, rusty, three-legged stool, upon which my frail friend would sit as he shined the shoes that were placed on a stained and well-used shoeshine box that was full of his polishes and brushes, and there was an ornate lamppost (which was kindly furnished by the city of Lisbon), upon which the customer would lean while he was having his shoes shined.\nHe would carefully apply two coats of polish, using a brush to polish between each coat. Last, he applied a special product that would give the shoes that extra special shine. With a final snap of the cloth, he would stand up, take off his little Portuguese cap, make a deep bow, and say, \u201cPronto. Seus sapatos foram engrashados pelo o melhor engraxate do mundo.\u201d \u201cThere. Your shoes were shined by the very best shoeshine man in the world.\u201d I was convinced that I had had my shoes shined by the very best.\nA few months after our mission, I was called to serve as the Regional Representative to Portugal and had the opportunity to return to Lisbon a number of times. As occasion permitted, I would have my shoes shined by the \u201cbest shoeshine man in the world.\u201d\nThe last few times that I went, I was unable to find him at his usual place of business. I finally inquired at the prestigious stores that surrounded the square. The response was the same, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened to him. It seems that we had heard that he had died.\u201d I remember thinking, Could it be that the best shoeshine man in the world had died, and no one really knew or even seemed to care? I wondered: Had there been someone there with him, or did he slip away unnoticed?\nMay we contrast that for a moment with Brother and Sister Joaquim Aires, a marvelous man and his wife who came to Portugal following the 1974 revolution of Portugal\u2019s colonies in Angola and Mozambique. They had returned to Portugal unknown and with very few possessions. A great blessing occurred in their lives. They opened their door to two young missionaries, who taught them of the restoration of Christ\u2019s church. They received the missionaries, accepted their message, and were baptized.\nAs is the opportunity for all worthy men in the Church, he received the priesthood\u2014authority to act in the name of our Father in Heaven\u2014and to become a leader in the Church. Brother Aires became President Aires, president of one of the mission districts.\nOne day I received a telephone call. President Aires was in the hospital in Coimbra, several hours\u2019 travel away. He had suffered a very serious cerebral hemorrhage and was in very critical condition. Another priesthood holder and I made the trip as quickly as possible. As we walked quietly into the hospital room, we found him asleep. My first inclination was not to awaken him. And then I thought he would want to know that we had come. So I reached over and carefully touched his hand. He slowly opened his eyes and then looked at me for a moment, and then the tears came to both of our eyes. He then said in a very weak and soft voice, \u201cI knew you would come. I knew you would come. Would you please give me a blessing.\u201d In his dear, sweet faith, he was asking for a priesthood blessing, the same that is taught of and recorded in the Bible. We read in James 5:14\u201315: \u201cIs any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:\n\u201cAnd the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.\u201d\nAs men of the priesthood, it was our privilege to pronounce a blessing on him with power and authority of our Father in Heaven.\nAs I would meet with the members of the Church from one end of Portugal to the other, the brothers and sisters would ask, \u201cHow is Brother Aires? Will you please tell him we love him and we\u2019re praying for him?\u201d\nThis good man and his wife, who had returned to Portugal almost unknown, now, because of their membership in the Church, had literally thousands who loved them and were concerned about them and remembered him in their prayers.\nThe prayers of faith were answered. He recovered completely, and he and Sister Aires went on to fulfill a full-time mission together.\nI have thought often of the contrast between the two\u2014my little shoeshine man on one hand, who, like so many of life\u2019s unknown wanderers, had slipped away without any understanding of life\u2019s purpose; and Brother Aires on the other, who was not only taught of life\u2019s real purpose, but had now become a part of a great body of people who showed their love and appreciation for him.\nAs the Apostle Paul wrote to the members of the Church, or Saints as they were called and are called today, he reminded the newly baptized members of the Church of the blessings of belonging when he told them, \u201cYe are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.\u201d (Eph. 2:19.) What a blessing it is to belong and to be wanted and needed! It becomes even more apparent during life\u2019s tender moments.\nTo all who find themselves outside the household of faith and away from the Saints, would you please accept this invitation to come unto Christ that we might all, as Alma said, \u201cbear one another\u2019s burdens.\u201d (Mosiah 18:8.) Join with the Saints, that you might not be any longer strangers alone in this world, but truly cared for, loved, and appreciated.\nAnd to all of us\u2014those of us who are members of the Church, could I just counsel with you for a moment? Do you have anyone that you know who might be as our little shoeshine man, who is alone\u2014alone in this great crowd of people\u2014that could use your special love and caring and concern? Could you take a moment and let such people know how much you love them?\nAnd may we also, as members of the Church, truly do our part to make His church a welcome refuge for all of our Father in Heaven\u2019s children, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, amen.\nHarold G. Hillam\nNo More Strangers and Foreigners\n1990\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "Today I would like to pose a question asked long ago by Job: \u201cWhere shall wisdom be found?\u201d (Job 28:12.)\nLeaders of this Church have repeatedly emphasized the importance of education. It is a vital component of wisdom. Not long after the pioneers began construction of their temple in Illinois, they established the University of the City of Nauvoo. The First Presidency proclaimed that this university \u201cwill enable us to teach our children wisdom, to instruct them in all the knowledge and learning, in the arts, sciences, and learned professions.\u201d1\nA similar scene followed after the persecuted pioneers entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Less than three years later, on 28 February 1850, they instituted the University of the State of Deseret.2 Later several academies of learning were established.\nNow as Church membership worldwide exceeds eight million, it is evident that a direct role of the Church in secular education is no longer feasible. Yet our commitment to education remains constant.\nScriptures teach that \u201cthe glory of God is intelligence.\u201d (D&C 93:36.) They also teach that individual \u201cintelligences \u2026 were organized before the world was.\u201d (Abr. 3:22.) \u201cMan was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\u201d (D&C 93:29.)\nOur personal intelligence is everlasting and divine. I believe Thomas Jefferson felt that dignity of the human spirit when he wrote: \u201cI have sworn upon the Altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\u201d3\nSeek Education\nBecause of our sacred regard for each human intellect, we consider the obtaining of an education to be a religious responsibility. Yet opportunities and abilities differ. I believe that in the pursuit of education, individual desire is more influential than institution, and personal faith more forceful than faculty.\nOur Creator expects His children everywhere to educate themselves. He issued a commandment: \u201cSeek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.\u201d (D&C 88:118.) And He assures us that knowledge acquired here will be ours forever. (See D&C 130:18\u201319.)\nMeasured by this celestial standard, it is apparent that those who impulsively \u201cdrop out\u201d and cut short their education not only disregard divine decree but frustrate the realization of their own potential.\nI remember my moment of resolution many years ago when, as an untrained teenager, I secured temporary employment at Christmastime. The work was monotonous. Each hour and each day passed slowly. I resolved then and there that I must obtain an education that would qualify me better for life. I determined to stay in school and work for an education as though my very life depended upon it.\nLater as stake president I was questioned by many young people about their own educational pursuits. Some asked me how long it took to become a doctor of medicine. \u201cThe general pattern would be four years at a university, followed by four years in medical school,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd if you choose to become a specialist, that could take another five years or more, depending upon your desire.\u201d\nThat occasionally evoked a reaction: \u201cThat adds up to thirteen years\u2014and maybe more? That\u2019s too long for me!\u201d\n\u201cIt all depends,\u201d I would respond. \u201cPreparation for your career is not too long if you know what you want to do with your life. How old will you be thirteen years from now if you don\u2019t pursue your education? Just as old, whether or not you become what you want to be!\u201d\nSo my counsel then\u2014and now\u2014is to continue your education wherever you are, whatever your interest and opportunity, however you determine you can best serve your family and society.\nBeware of Unbalance\nChoose what you will learn and whose purposes you will serve. But don\u2019t place all your intellectual eggs in one basket of secular learning. Remember this warning from the Book of Mormon:\n\u201cO the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.\n\u201cBut to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.\u201d (2 Ne. 9:28\u201329.)\nThat scripture reminds me of a friend who proudly boasted that his climb toward wealth had come from tireless work and lessons learned in the \u201cschool of hard knocks.\u201d But his fortune had come at the expense of his spiritual development. When it was too late, he regretfully discovered that his ladder of success had been leaning against the wrong wall. He had never read this instruction from his Maker:\n\u201cSeek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.\u201d (D&C 6:7; see also D&C 11:7.)\nMankind\u2019s unfamiliarity with the scriptures has sometimes brought sorrow to great numbers of people over long periods of time. The suffering that has resulted from such ignorance is truly tragic. May I illustrate with excerpts from history that pertain to the spread of infection.\nIn the nineteenth century, health officials and others were concerned about pollution of the air, not by visible smoggy hydrocarbons of today, but by an invisible miasma that was blamed for almost any infection. In 1867, for example, Lord Lister indicted bad air as the chief cause of infection.4 Because of that, in 1869 Simpson from Edinburgh urged that hospitals be taken down and rebuilt every few years.5 Such an extravagant practice was also advocated by other experts.6\nEven Florence Nightingale, a living legend following her heroic efforts in the Crimean War, failed to recognize the transmission of infection from one patient to another\u2014this despite her careful notations that wound infection accounted for 40 percent of postoperative mortality.7\nBut others missed the connection, too. For centuries, lives of innumerable mothers and children were claimed by \u201cchildbirth fever\u201d\u2014infections unknowingly transmitted among the innocent by unwashed hands of attendants.8\nIt was only a short century ago that the great work of Koch, Pasteur, and others proved that infection could be caused by bacteria in contaminated body fluids\u2014or infected issues\u2014passed from one individual to another.\nWith these highlights of history in mind, may I quote the word of the Lord recorded long ago in Leviticus, chapter fifteen:\n\u201cThe Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n\u201cSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.\n\u201cAnd this shall be his uncleanness in his issue. \u2026\n\u201cEvery bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.\n\u201cAnd whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water. \u2026\n\u201cAnd he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water.\u201d (Lev. 15:1\u20135, 7; emphasis added.)\nSeveral verses follow which re-emphasize and illustrate those important principles. Then we read this conclusion:\n\u201cAnd when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall \u2026 wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.\u201d (Lev. 15:13.)\nThus, our loving Heavenly Father had clearly revealed principles of clean technique in the handling of infected patients more than three thousand years ago! These scriptures are in complete harmony with modern medical guidelines.9 But during those many millennia, how many mothers needlessly perished? How many children suffered because man\u2019s quest for knowledge had failed to incorporate the word of the Lord?\nContemporary Challenges\nIn our day, many challenges face us. Some are new, some are old\u2014simply clothed in modern attire. The epistles of Paul include prophecies pertaining to our day. Do these descriptions sound familiar?\n\u201cIn the last days perilous times shall come.\n\u201cFor men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, [and the list of insidious qualities goes on] \u2026\n\u201cWithout natural affection, \u2026\n\u201cLovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;\n\u201cHaving a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: \u2026\n\u201cEver learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\u201d (2 Tim. 3:1\u20135, 7.)\nPaul\u2019s warnings describe apostasy and other dangers of our day. Some of these perils are contrary to God\u2019s purposes and are championed by persuasive people possessing more ability than morality, more knowledge than wisdom. Their rationalization breeds justification. The Bible affirms that the \u201cway of a fool is right in his own eyes.\u201d (Prov. 12:15.) Indeed, individuals with malignity of purpose often wear the mask of honesty. So we must constantly be on guard.\nTo build a house straight and strong, you do not choose crooked boards. So to build your eternal destiny, you cannot\u2014you must not\u2014limit lessons only to those warped to exclude revelation from God. The Book of Mormon offers this note of caution and hope:\n\u201cSeek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.\u201d (Jacob 4:10.)\nRemember the terrible price paid for ignorance of divine instruction. Until the turn of this century, infection was spread as if no one had ever read or taken seriously the fifteenth chapter of Leviticus. Where is wisdom?\nToday we are seriously concerned with the increasing incidence of human infection with HIV (Human Immunosuppressive Virus) and variant viruses and the associated outbreak of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). An epidemic has been forecast\u2014a plague fueled by a vocal few who exhibit greater concern for civil rights than for public health, a plague abetted by the immoral. Some live in lust as though God\u2019s commandment to be chaste was written with an asterisk, exempting them from obeying. And regrettably, as in previous plagues, many innocent victims are doomed to suffer. Where is wisdom?\nAvoidable deaths and mounting financial burdens are also incurred worldwide because of indifference to or ignorance of God\u2019s declaration that tobacco \u201cis not good for man.\u201d (D&C 89:8.) Many other societal problems could be listed, such as alcohol and drug abuse, gambling, civil strife, and erosion of family stability.10 We may know so much, yet learn so little. \u201cWhere is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?\u201d11 Again I ask, Where is wisdom?\nWisdom Found\nWisdom is to be found in pure intelligence\u2014in that divine light which can guide people in all countries, all climes, and all continents. The Lord has promised that \u201ca light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel.\u201d (D&C 45:28.) Then He lamented:\n\u201cBut they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men. \u2026\n\u201cAnd there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.\n\u201cBut my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.\n\u201cAnd there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me.\u201d (D&C 45:29, 31\u201333; see also D&C 87:6.)\nIn bright contrast to such bitter chaos, the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ beams as the hope of the world. Missionaries and members courageously proclaim its brilliance. Wise students throughout the world heed its light and enrich their education by adding the curriculum of Church Seminaries and Institutes. The Lord hides His wisdom from no one: \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\u201d (James 1:5.)\nAgain I pose the question once asked by Job: \u201cWhere shall wisdom be found?\u201d (Job 28:12.) Answer: It emanates from the Lord. He Himself said,\n\u201cI will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.\u201d (2 Ne. 28:30.)\nDivine light and wisdom continue to increase when love for Deity grows:\n\u201cThat which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.\u201d (D&C 50:24; see also D&C 88:67.)\n\u201cHe that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.\u201d (D&C 93:28.)\nWhere is wisdom? It pulses and surges with the Lord\u2019s light of truth! With that light He lifts us toward eternal life, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRussell M. Nelson\nWhere Is Wisdom?\n1992\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "President Kimball has declared, \u201cThe vitalizing of the Aaronic Priesthood Quorums and awakening of the Melchizedek Priesthood Quorums will affirmatively affect all other programs in the Church.\u201d\nHow can we vitalize the Aaronic Priesthood quorum?\nFirst, consider the source of the quorum itself.\nEvery priesthood holder has the sacred privilege of belonging to a quorum and has the right to activity in that quorum. We have no right to deny him that honor. Yet we do just that when we do not reach out to involve him.\nWhen we contemplate the purposes for which priesthood quorums are organized\u2014to provide a brotherhood, a service unit, and a school for learning the principles of the gospel and the responsibilities we have as priesthood bearers\u2014we might well ask, Is our quorum properly organized and functioning?\nIs the presidency in place, schooled in their duties, and aware of their responsibility to lead all of the young men in their age group? Is the presidency meeting weekly to plan and carry out a meaningful quorum activity program?\nThe Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Guidebook has been published to provide training materials for the quorum presidency and their adviser. Quorum advisers should teach the ten training sessions in the guidebook as part of the quorum presidency meetings, which should be held weekly.\nAs the presidency learns their duties, they will include the quorum members in planning and implementing the quorum program, including the activation of those who need special attention, using the active quorum members to apply positive peer pressure, surrounding the inactives with their protective love and concern.\nTo help in the activation process, the quorum presidency will assign particular quorum members to fellowship each inactive young man in a specific way and to make progress reports on the assignment. A wise quorum presidency will plan activities to appeal to all those in the quorum.\nThe quorum presidency will personally visit the homes of all the young men of quorum age.\nMark Peterson was ordained a deacon one Sunday last March. When the family returned from church, the telephone rang. It was the deacons president who asked for an appointment for the presidency of the deacons quorum to visit with Mark and with his parents. The appointment was set. Promptly at the hour set, the doorbell rang. The members of the presidency stood on the porch, dressed in suits, white shirts, and ties, and each one carrying his scriptures.\nSitting down with Mark and his parents, they began with prayer, then handed an agenda to everyone there.\nThe president then opened the scriptures, having Mark and his father read those references which speak of the power of the Aaronic Priesthood, what it is, and the particular duties of a deacon.\nThe president then spoke about Mark\u2019s particular responsibilities and duties: how he should dress, how he should pass the sacrament, act as a messenger, collect fast offerings. And then they asked him if he had any questions.\nAt the end of the visit they welcomed him to the quorum and offered help whenever he needed it. As they left, Mark\u2019s eyes were as big as saucers. He said to his Dad: \u201cThey were awesome!\u201d\nOh, that every Aaronic Priesthood quorum was a royal brotherhood where each member could say, \u201cI have true brothers who care about me, who will protect me and sustain me, who think enough of me to correct me.\u201d\nSecond, what miracles the right man serving as an adviser can perform in the lives of the Aaronic Priesthood holders.\nWe have discovered that the nature and quality of a young man\u2019s relationship with his Aaronic Priesthood adviser is a potent predictor of many of the outcomes we desire in that young man\u2019s life. This relationship becomes increasingly important as young men advance through the priesthood. In fact, it\u2019s the best predictor of the real religious feelings and experience for priest-age young men.\nHow vital it is to choose an adviser who can provide the hero image for our young men as they begin to assert their independence from father and family.\nOur young men will respond almost overnight to a man who really shows he cares. But he must be left in his assignment long enough to build relationships, to gain the trust and confidence of the young men, to truly make them his friends.\nThe advisers need training to be effective.\nOnce again, the Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Guidebook provides information, material, and a timetable for such training to be given by the bishopric. Please see that this is done.\nThird, the Lord has called the bishop to be the president of the Aaronic Priesthood. President Kimball has reminded the bishops that this is their first and foremost responsibility. All bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood should know that the Lord has assigned the bishop to be their champion and exemplar, that it should be safe for each of them to follow the bishop\u2019s example in every activity of his life.\nAs the president of the Aaronic Priesthood, the bishop has the responsibility to give his personal attention to each bearer of the Aaronic Priesthood. No young man in the ward should ever feel that he walks alone, that he is not wanted or needed. He should always know that his bishop is his fellow servant, approachable, empathetic, a confidant, his champion.\nIt\u2019s not enough for the bishop to meet his Aaronic Priesthood only in the confines of the Church. Our bishops need to come out from behind the pulpit, take their ties off, and come to know their Aaronic Priesthood in real-life situations.\nI have a dear friend who served as a very successful bishop. During his tenure, the stake president asked a boy and a girl from each ward to visit with him about their relationship with their bishop. During the conversation, the stake president asked, \u201cIf you had a serious problem in your life, would you take it to your bishop?\u201d Most responded that they wouldn\u2019t. And when he asked why, their response surprised him. They said, \u201cOur bishop seems too righteous.\u201d To the credit of my friend, his youth replied: \u201cNot our bishop.\u201d\nThe bishop\u2019s most positive impact on youth comes in informal settings, activities, Scouting, service projects, athletics\u2014real-life settings where they get to know him as a man.\nAt a recent encampment planned and directed by stake and ward priesthood leaders, I asked a young man how he felt about his leaders. He responded: \u201cI\u2019ve always been scared around stake presidents and bishops. For some reason I always feel like I\u2019m getting interviewed. But living in camp with them has helped me make friends with them. Next time I have an interview we\u2019ll have memories to talk about.\u201d\nNote that the Lord called the bishop to personally serve as president of the priests\u2019 quorum. By virtue of that presidency, the bishop holds the keys of that office, which may not be delegated to another. The Lord requires that the bishop become the friend of each priest, that he be sensitive to personal and group needs at all times, that there be a feeling of brotherhood and fellowship between him and his priests. No priest should ever go astray if the bishop, through the exercise of his keys of presidency, helped him hold on to the doctrines and practices of the Church.\nIn words carefully selected to impress upon a bishop the importance of his calling and appointment as president of the priests quorum, President David O. McKay said, \u201cBishop, what is your priests quorum but an opportunity for you as president of that quorum to get these young men around you as your bodyguard, young men who crave the social atmosphere of the ward and whom you may lead in paths of honor, trustworthiness, and faith?\u201d\nPlease, bishops, interview each priest at least twice a year, and each deacon and each teacher at least once a year, for worthiness and spiritual progress. Help him set goals, help teach him to understand the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood, and help prepare him for a mission and for temple marriage. Include the inactive boys in these interviews and challenge them to participate actively in the quorum. See that your counselors interview those deacons and teachers at least once a year.\nPersonalize those interviews. Make them meaningful. Show you care. Those one-to-one, heart-to-heart opportunities are priceless in guiding our young men.\nWe\u2019re so anxious to have your great influence on the youth, and we can promise you that your mark will be on them for eternity if you demonstrate your love for them.\nFourth, the program of the Aaronic Priesthood quorum should not only provide opportunities for learning the doctrines of the Church in the classroom, but also for translating the doctrine into real-life experiences through balanced activities having a priesthood purpose. The Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Guidebook tells us how to plan effectively to have successful experiences.\nAll of the young men\u2019s activities should be an outgrowth of the quorum\u2014quorum led, quorum planned.\nIt\u2019s important for these activities to be held regularly. Our Church handbooks request that each quorum have a weekly activity on a day other than Sunday. At least once a month a combined activity with the Young Women should be held. When these directions are followed, good habits are formed; but when activities are held sporadically or \u201cas needed,\u201d the continuity essential for the success of the program is missing. Plan them well in advance, at least three months in advance, but preferably a year in advance. Careful calendaring and adequate planning will allow time to do things well and will be attractive to our youth.\nConsidering the many interests, skills, and personalities of our young men, it is imperative that you use all the resources available to reach every a boy.\nAmong those resources, Scouting provides a tested, proven program for us to use in holding our young men close to the Church. It appeals to boys. Its trail to the Eagle rank helps a young man set worthwhile goals, then realize them. For some reason there is a direct correlation between young men who achieve the Eagle rank and those who serve missions.\nIn an area encampment held in Arizona this summer, an Eagle Scout banquet was held to honor 1,150 Eagle Scouts. During that banquet, every Eagle Scout committed himself to serving a mission.\nIts camping, hiking, and high adventure provide marvelous opportunities for our young men to enjoy a man\u2019s experience with men, building wholesome relationships between youth and adult leaders, something that happens too seldom in our day. Becoming a man is more than chronological. It involves proving the young man\u2019s manhood, testing his mettle, challenging the world, demonstrating he can accomplish more than he thought he was capable of. That\u2019s what builds character and manliness.\nA small Scout began a 50-mile hike in the mountains, laden down with a backpack he could hardly lift. As he struggled up the trail, he thought of giving up many times, yet carried on, successfully completing the hike. At the end of the trail, he stood in front of a framed map of the area, pointed his finger at the trail, and shouted, \u201cI licked ya!\u201d\nHow many young men have been converted to the Church through athletics, and how many more have been saved from inactivity through our sports programs? As our young men grow up, they tell us that team sports are the most popular activity in the Church. That doesn\u2019t mean unsupervised basketball on activity night. The sports program can be as broad as the interests of the young men: basketball, softball, volleyball, soccer, wrestling, boxing, cycling, swimming, tiddledywinks. Through sports we can appeal to the most inactive young men and, at the same time, build a spirit of brotherhood as quorum members learn to compete as a team.\nSome young men march to the beat of a different drum. Because they may not enjoy physical activity, as most do, they are often isolated from the group. I remember one young man, not much of an athlete, who excelled on the stage. In our ward plays and roadshows, we could always count on a stellar performance from Mike.\nLater in his youth he directed a theater-in-the-round production in the ward. Today he teaches drama in a great university and is a faithful member of the Church. How easily we could have lost him without that opportunity to be someone and to excel at something. Our cultural arts have been neglected in recent years, not intentionally, but when stakes and wards were given the liberty to choose their activities instead of being dictated to from Church headquarters\u2014something made necessary by the worldwide growth of the Church\u2014some took this as a signal that cultural arts were no longer to be promoted. The ward and stake activity committees are there to help our bishoprics, quorums, and Young Women classes carry out those cultural activities planned by the Bishopric Youth Committee: music, drama, speech, dance. These again are as broad as the interests of the youth and a valuable resource in promoting activity and brotherhood in the Aaronic Priesthood quorums.\nPlease give our young men the opportunity to stretch their souls in service. Too often we only entertain, leaving our young men in the role of spectators. They will grow as they are involved, and they will develop love for their fellowmen, at the same time forgetting their own weaknesses and frailties as they serve. The sooner our young men have experiences in meaningful service, the sooner they will understand their priesthood responsibilities and their own capacity to truly be their brother\u2019s keeper, and the sooner they will discover the key to lasting happiness. In service every quorum member will know that he is needed. Even the most inactive will respond to an invitation to bless someone\u2019s life.\nAll of these activities provide a wholesome environment where relationships can be cemented. Is this important? President David O. McKay reminded us, \u201cThe spirituality of a ward will be commensurate with the activity of the youth of that ward.\u201d\nI must say something about costs. Our presiding brethren have instructed us to be very careful how we spend the Saints\u2019 money. We who deal with the youth recognize that a good portion of stake and ward budgets, and much of the out-of-pocket Church expenses of our families, are related to youth activities such as athletics, Scouting, dances, plays, and youth conferences. They do cost money.\nYet it was never intended to do away with youth activities. If we do, we will be making a sad mistake. As President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke on the subject in general conference, he said: \u201cWe do not mean to be parsimonious. [That means stingy.] We mean to be judicious.\u201d I plead with you to weigh the worth of a young man against the dollar spent: use good judgment.\nIt\u2019s not necessary to spend a lot of money to meet the needs of our youth. Even a high adventure does not need to be an exotic, expensive trip. High adventures can be had close to home when well planned. Youth conferences need not be held in faraway places to serve their purposes. And what\u2019s wrong in letting our young men earn their money for Scouting, athletics, and other programs? They will learn some valuable lessons about the realities of life as they do.\nJust before his death, Elder S. Dilworth Young appeared before our Young Men General Board and told us about the dangers of giving boys everything. He spread out in front of us patterns for making tents, backpacks, sleeping bags, stoves, cooking utensils; and then he talked about the pride and the growth experienced by his young men as they enjoyed building them for themselves.\nAs we use all the resources available to us to vitalize the Aaronic Priesthood quorums we will be successful in reaching our young men. Further, we will be awakening the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums as these stalwart young men come of age, taking the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood and transferring their faith, devotion, and loyalty to their elders quorums. And all the programs of the Church will be affirmatively affected.\nAs the Presidency of the Young Men of the Church, we challenge you stake presidents, bishops, advisers and adult leaders, and quorum presidencies and quorum members: select three quorum members who are presently inactive. If the quorum is small, select three nonmembers on whom you will focus your efforts. Use every resource available to activate, convert, and involve these three young men in the next year\u2014that\u2019s only one every four months. Three young men per quorum in the next year? That\u2019s not much from where you sit, but Churchwide we would have close to 100,000 young men active and participating in the quorums who are now fumbling in darkness without the quorum.\nAs I was called to be the President of the Young Men of the Church, I was given the \u201cchallenge to provide a program which will prepare this generation of youth to meet the Savior when He comes.\u201d I pass that challenge on to all of you, adult leaders and young men, bearing my witness that this generation of youth is a royal generation with very special things to do. May God help all of us to give the time, attention, and tender, loving care we need to give, to prepare these noble young men for the rich adventures and the singular missions that lie ahead of them, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nRobert L. Backman\nRevitalizing Aaronic Priesthood Quorums\n1982\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "Brethren, I have decided to talk to you and to myself tonight about \u201cfaith in the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d which the Prophet Joseph Smith named as \u201cthe first principle \u2026 of the Gospel\u201d (A of F 1:4).\nThe scriptures leave no doubt about the importance of such faith. In the very beginning, an angel sent by the Lord instructed Adam that the sacrifice he was offering was \u201ca similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, \u2026\n\u201cWherefore,\u201d he (the angel) added, \u201cthou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore\u201d (Moses 5:7\u20138).\nNephi thus instructed his people:\n\u201cBehold I say unto you, that \u2026 as the Lord \u2026 liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, \u2026 whereby man can be saved\u201d (2 Ne. 25:20).\nSome four hundred years later, King Benjamin declared:\n\u201cI say unto you, \u2026 there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent\u201d (Mosiah 3:17).\nWhen Peter and John were asked by the Sadducees \u201cBy what power, or by what name\u201d they had healed the lame man, \u201cPeter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\n\u201cIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;\n\u201cBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. \u2026\n\u201cNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:7\u201310, 12).\nJesus himself declared to the Pharisees: \u201cIf ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins\u201d (John 8:24).\nAnd in these latter days the Lord declared to Joseph Smith the Prophet, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer:\n\u201cTake upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.\n\u201cAnd as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.\n\u201cBehold, Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be saved;\n\u201cWherefore, all men must take upon them the name which is given of the Father, for in that name shall they be called at the last day;\n\u201cWherefore, if they know not the name by which they are called, they cannot have place in the kingdom of my Father\u201d (D&C 18:21\u201325).\nI suppose that the foregoing declarations are sufficient to establish the fact that the scriptures teach that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is indispensable to the attainment of salvation.\nThis is so because Jesus, by means of his atonement and victory over the grave, made it possible for men to be forgiven of their sins and raised from the grave.\nOn this point, the resurrected Jesus said to the Nephites:\n\u201cBehold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you\u2014that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\n\u201cAnd my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil\u2014\n\u201cAnd for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.\n\u201cAnd he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.\n\u201cAnd no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.\n\u201cNow this is the commandment [this is the resurrected Jesus talking]: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel\u201d (3 Ne. 27:13\u201317, 19\u201321).\nThis, of course, is the perfect definition of the gospel. It was, however, spoken by way of summary and conclusion after the risen Jesus had spent days\u2014perhaps weeks\u2014explaining the principles and ordinances of the gospel to the Nephites. They, therefore, were able to understand his summary.\nThe gospel is the plan and program adopted by God, our Eternal Father, for accomplishing his \u201cwork and \u2026 glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (Moses 1:39).\nThis program the Lord presented to his spirit children in the great pre-earth council, of which Abraham gives us this brief account:\n\u201cNow the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;\n\u201cAnd God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, \u2026\n\u201cAnd there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;\n\u201cAnd we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;\n\u201cAnd they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.\n\u201cAnd the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.\n\u201cAnd the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him\u201d (Abr. 3:22\u201328).\nThe gospel plan or program, presented to and approved by a two-thirds majority of the then assembled hosts of God\u2019s spirit children, anticipated everything that has occurred or that will occur in heaven or on earth concerning those spirits.\nIt provided for them to receive physical bodies in a mortal experience where, endowed with free agency and being acted upon by good and evil, they would prove themselves worthy or unworthy to return to the society of God and go on in eternal progress to perfection.\nIt anticipated the banishment from heaven of Satan and his followers, the creation of this earth, the placing of Adam and Eve upon it, their partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, their banishment from the Garden, and the peopling of the earth by their posterity.\nIt anticipated Satan\u2019s diabolical work among men, man\u2019s wickedness, and his death, both temporal and spiritual.\nIt anticipated the need for a Savior to win the victory over death, atone for the sin of Adam, which brought death, and provide the means whereby men, through repentance, may receive forgiveness for personal sins and be readmitted into the presence of God.\nAll these things and more were anticipated by the gospel plan.\nTo us the plan is known as the gospel of Jesus Christ because he sponsored it in the heavenly council and implemented it through the atonement which he in the great council voluntarily undertook to make and did come to the earth and make.\nThe Father\u2019s plan was based on the principle of free agency. Lucifer countered with a proposal to substitute force for free agency, and sought honor for himself.\nJesus, of course, was chosen to be the Redeemer. He led the fight for the Father\u2019s plan in the War in Heaven. He created this earth. He has watched over it ever since. His role in God\u2019s program for bringing to pass \u201cthe immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (Moses 1:39) has been revealed to men in all dispensations. It was revealed to Adam in the beginning. It was revealed to Enoch, to Noah, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Some 2200 years B.C., Jesus appeared to the brother of Jared and said:\n\u201cBehold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. \u2026 In me shall all mankind have light, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters\u201d (Ether 3:14).\nIn the meridian of time, Jesus, begotten of God our Eternal Father, came to earth as the babe of Bethlehem, the son of Mary.\nBorn of woman, he was subject to temptation and the weaknesses of the flesh. Begotten Son of the Father, he inherited the power to live on indefinitely.\nBeing tempted but never yielding to sin enabled him, by giving his life, to atone for the transgression of Adam, which introduced death into the world. This he did, and thereby won victory over the grave and brought about resurrection for himself and for all men.\nNot only did he win victory over the grave, but being sinless himself and being the Son of God in the flesh and having been foreordained in the heavens to be the Redeemer, he, in some way which we do not fully understand, \u201ctook upon Himself the burdensome onus of the sins of mankind. The means may be, to our finite minds, a mystery, yet the results are our salvation.\n\u201cSomething of the Savior\u2019s agony as He groaned under this load of guilt \u2026 He has [thus revealed to us] in this day:\n\u201c\u2018For behold, I, God,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;\n\u201c\u2018But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;\n\u201c\u2018Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit\u2014and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink\u2014\n\u201c\u2018Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men\u2019 [D&C 19:16\u201319]\u201d (James E. Talmage, The Articles of Faith, 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 78).\nJacob, the brother of Nephi, thus describes the predicament we would be in without the benefit of Christ\u2019s atonement. He said:\n\u201cO the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.\n\u201cO how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; \u2026\n\u201cAnd because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.\n\u201cAnd this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel\u201d (2 Ne. 9:8, 10\u201312).\nWithout the services of Jesus Christ, which he proffered in the great heavenly council and which he has since performed, there would have been no hope for us to receive the blessings provided by the gospel. And we have no prospect of receiving them now unless we have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, because, as he said to the Pharisees, \u201cIf ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins\u201d (John 8:24). This is according to the gospel, which Paul said \u201cis the power of God unto salvation\u201d (Rom. 1:16).\nThese are some of the reasons why \u201cFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d is the first principle of the gospel. To the truth of these teachings I bear solemn witness, and in the words of King Benjamin, I add my own witness that I know \u201cthere shall be no other name [than Jesus Christ] given nor any other \u2026 means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent\u201d (Mosiah 3:17). This is my testimony to you, my brethren, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, amen.\nMarion G. Romney\nFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ\n1979\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "In the struggles of mortality, we are never left alone to accomplish our work, to fight our battles, to face adversity or unanswered questions. Jesus Christ taught with a parable \u201cthat men ought always to pray, and not to faint.\u201d\u00a0He told of a judge who did not honor God and did not have any regard for mankind. Repeatedly, a widow came before him, pleading to be avenged of her adversary. For a while, the judge would offer her no relief. But as a result of her faithful, consistent pleading, the judge finally thought, \u201cBecause this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.\u201d\nThen Jesus explained:\n\u201cShall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him\u00a0\u2026\u00a0?\n\u201cI tell you that he will avenge them speedily.\u201d\nAnd then the Lord asks this question: \u201cNevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\u201d1\nPrayer is essential to developing faith. When the Lord comes again, will He find a people who know how to pray in faith and who are prepared to receive salvation? \u201cFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d2 We are children of a loving Heavenly Father, and we may enjoy personal communion with Him when we pray \u201cwith a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ\u201d3 and then act in accordance with the answers we receive by the promptings of the Holy Ghost. In faith we pray, we listen, and we obey, that we might learn to become one with the Father and the Son.4\nA prayer of faith opens the way to receive glorious heaven-sent blessings. The Savior taught:\n\u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\n\u201cFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\u201d5\nIf we expect to receive, we must ask, seek, and knock. In his search for truth, Joseph Smith read from the scriptures, \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d6 In answer to his prayer of faith, the heavens were opened. God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, descended in glory and spoke to Joseph Smith, ushering in the dispensation of the fulness of times. For us, miraculous healing, powerful protection, divine knowledge, liberating forgiveness, and precious peace are among the answers that come when we offer up a \u201csoul\u2019s sincere desire\u201d7 in faith.\nWe pray to our Father in the name of Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus engaging all three members of the Godhead in our utterances.\nWe pray to our Heavenly Father and Him only because He is \u201cGod in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting \u2026\u00a0, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them.\u201d As our Creator, He gave commandments that we \u201cshould love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom [we] should worship.\u201d8\nAs you pray to Heavenly Father in faith, \u201che will console you in your afflictions, \u2026 [and ye may] feast upon his love.\u201d9 President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring shared that his father\u2019s prayers during a losing battle with cancer taught him the deeply personal relationship between God and His children:\n\u201cWhen the pain became intense, we found him in the morning on his knees by the bed. He had been too weak to get back into bed. He told us he had been praying to ask his Heavenly Father why he had to suffer so much when he had always tried to be good. He said a kindly answer came: \u2018God needs brave sons.\u2019\n\u201cAnd so he soldiered on to the end, trusting that God loved him, listened to him, and would lift him up. He was blessed to have known early and to never forget that a loving God is as close as a prayer.\u201d10\nWe pray in the name of Jesus Christ because our salvation is in Christ, and \u201cthere is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d11 We come unto the Father in the sacred name of Jesus Christ12 because He is our Advocate with the Father and He does plead our cause.13 He suffered, bled, and died to glorify His Father, and His merciful petition on our behalf opens the way for each of us to obtain peace in this life and everlasting life in the world to come. He does not want us to suffer longer or endure more trials than needed. He does want us to turn to Him and allow Him to ease our burdens, to heal our hearts, and to cleanse our souls through His purifying power. We never want to take His name in vain with rote and repetitious words. Sincere prayers offered in the holy name of Jesus Christ are an expression of our devoted love, our eternal gratitude, and our steadfast desire to pray as He prayed, to do as He did, and to become as He is.\nWe pray by the power of the Holy Ghost because \u201che that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God.\u201d14 When we pray with faith, the Holy Ghost can guide our thoughts so that our words harmonize with the will of God. \u201cAsk not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.\u201d15\n\u201cIt is not only important that we shall know how to pray, but it is equally important that we shall know how to receive the answer to our prayer, to be discerning, to be alert, to be able to see with clear vision and understand with clear intention God\u2019s will and purpose concerning us.\u201d16\nPresident Eyring shared: \u201cI have had prayers answered. Those answers were most clear when what I wanted was silenced by an overpowering need to know what God wanted. It is then that the answer from a loving Heavenly Father can be spoken to the mind by the still, small voice and can be written on the heart.\u201d17\nAs the Savior entered the Garden of Gethsemane, His soul was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. In His agony, the only one He could turn to was His Father. He pleaded, \u201cIf it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\u201d But He added, \u201cNevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\u201d18 Though sinless, the Savior was called upon to \u201c[suffer] pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind,\u201d including the sicknesses and infirmities of His people. \u201c[He] suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance.\u201d19 Three times He prayed, \u201cFather, thy will be done.\u201d20 The cup was not removed. In humble, faithful prayer He was strengthened to go forward and fulfill His divine mission to prepare for our salvation, that we might repent, believe, obey, and obtain the blessings of eternity.\nThe answers we receive in prayer may not be what we would desire. But in times of trouble, our prayers become a lifeline of love and tender mercy. In our pleading, we may be strengthened to go forward and fulfill all that we have been ordained to do. To His Saints living in perilous times, the Lord says, \u201cLet your hearts be comforted \u2026\u00a0; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God.\u201d21\nWhether we pray privately, with our families, at church, in the temple, or wherever we are; whether we pray with broken hearts and contrite spirits seeking forgiveness, heavenly wisdom, or simply the strength to endure, we pray always with full hearts, drawn out unto God continually for our welfare and the welfare of those around us. Sincere desires offered in a spirit of gratitude for abundant blessings and gratitude for the lessons of life instill in our hearts steadfast faith in Christ, a \u201cbrightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.\u201d22\nPrayer is a gift from God. We need never feel lost or alone. I testify that every moment of precious prayer can be holy time spent with our Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Carol\u00a0F. McConkie\nThe Soul\u2019s Sincere Desire\n2016\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "I am grateful to be with you in this meeting of the priesthood of God. We are in many different places tonight and at many stages in our priesthood service. Yet with all the variety of our circumstances, we have a need in common. It is to learn our duties in the priesthood and to grow in our power to perform them.\nAs a deacon I felt keenly that need. I lived in a tiny branch of the Church in New Jersey, on the East Coast of the United States. I was the only deacon in the branch\u2014not just the only one attending but the only one on the records. My older brother, Ted, was the only teacher. He is here tonight.\nWhile I was still a deacon, my family moved to Utah. There I found three wonderful things in place to speed my growth in the priesthood. The first was a president who knew how to sit in council with the members of his quorum. The second was great faith in Jesus Christ that led to the great love we have heard of\u2014love for each other. And the third was a shared conviction that our overarching priesthood purpose was to labor for the salvation of men.\nIt wasn\u2019t the well-established ward that made the difference. What was there in that ward could be anywhere, in whatever unit of the Church you are in.\nThese three things may be so much a part of your experience in the priesthood that you hardly notice them. For others you may not feel the need for growth, so these helps may be invisible to you. Either way, I pray that the Spirit will help me make them clear and attractive to you.\nMy purpose in speaking of these three aids to growing in the priesthood is to urge you to value them and to use them. If you do, your service will be transformed for the better. And if it is magnified, your priesthood service will bless Heavenly Father\u2019s children more than you can now imagine is possible.\nI found the first when I was welcomed into a priests quorum, with the bishop as our president. That may seem a small, unremarkable thing to you, but it gave me a sense of power in the priesthood that has changed my service in the priesthood ever since. It began by the way he led us.\nAs near as I could tell, he treated the opinions of young priests as if we were the wisest men in the world. He waited until all who would speak had spoken. He listened. And when he decided what should be done, it seemed to me that the Spirit confirmed the decisions to us and to him.\nI realize now I had felt what the scripture means when it says that the president is to sit in council with the members of his quorum.1 And years later as I was a bishop with my priests quorum, both they and I were taught by what I had learned as a young priest.\nTwenty years later as a bishop, I had the opportunity to see the effectiveness of a council not just in the meetinghouse but also in the mountains. During a Saturday activity, a member of our quorum had been lost in the forest overnight. As far as we knew, he was alone and without warm clothes, food, or shelter. We searched for him without success.\nMy memory is that we prayed together, the priests quorum and I, and I then asked each to speak. I listened intently, and it seemed to me that they did too, to each other. After a while, a feeling of peace settled on us. I felt that our lost quorum member was safe and dry somewhere.\nIt became clear to me what the quorum was to do and not to do. When the people who found him described the place in the woods where he had gone for safety, I felt that I recognized it. But the larger miracle for me was to see a united priesthood council\u2019s faith in Jesus Christ bringing revelation to the man with the priesthood keys. We all grew that day in the power of the priesthood.\nThe second key to increased learning is to have love for each other that comes from great faith. I am not sure which comes first, but both always seem to be there whenever there is great and rapid learning in the priesthood. Joseph Smith taught that to us by example.\nIn the early days of the Church in this dispensation, he received a command from God to build strength in the priesthood. He was directed to create schools for priesthood holders. The Lord set the requirement that there be love for each other among those who were to teach and to be taught. Here are the words of the Lord about creating a place of priesthood learning and what it was like for those who were to learn in it:\n\u201cOrganize yourselves; \u2026 establish a house \u2026 of learning, \u2026 a house of order. \u2026\n\u201cAppoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.\u201d2\nThe Lord is describing what we have already seen is the strength of a priesthood council or a class to bring revelation by the Spirit. Revelation is the only way we can come to know that Jesus is the Christ. That great faith is the first rung on the ladder we climb to learn the principles of the gospel.\nIn section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in verses 123 and 124, the Lord stressed love for each other and not finding fault with each other. Each gained entry into the priesthood school established by the Lord\u2019s prophet by making a covenant with uplifted hands to be a \u201cfriend and brother \u2026 in the bonds of love.\u201d3\nNow, we do not follow that practice today, but wherever I have seen remarkable learning in the priesthood, there are those bonds of love. Again I have seen it as both a cause and an effect of learning gospel truths. Love invites the Holy Ghost to be present to confirm truth. And the joy of learning divine truths creates love in the hearts of people who shared the experience of learning.\nThe reverse is true as well. Discord or jealousy inhibits the ability of the Holy Ghost to teach us and inhibits our ability to receive light and truth. And the feelings of disappointment that invariably follow are the seeds of greater discord and faultfinding among those who expected a learning experience that did not come.\nThe priesthood holders who learn well together always seem to me to have great peacemakers among them. You see peacemaking in priesthood classes and in councils. It is the gift to help people find common ground when others are seeing differences. It is the peacemaker\u2019s gift to help people see that what someone else said was a contribution rather than a correction.\nWith enough of the pure love of Christ and a desire to be peacemakers, unity is possible in priesthood councils and in classes. It takes patience and humility, but I have seen it happen even when issues are difficult and the people in councils or classes come from vastly different backgrounds.\nIt is possible to rise to the lofty standard set by the Lord for priesthood holders in making decisions in quorums. It is possible when there is great faith and love and the absence of contention. Here is the Lord\u2019s requirement for His endorsement of our decisions: \u201cAnd every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other.\u201d4\nThe third aid to learning in the priesthood comes with a shared conviction about why the Lord blesses and trusts us to hold and to exercise His priesthood. It is to labor for the salvation of men. This shared conviction brings unity in quorums. We can begin to learn about this from the scriptural account of how we spirit sons were prepared before birth for this rare honor of holding the priesthood.\nSpeaking of those given great priesthood trust in this life, the Lord said, \u201cEven before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.\u201d5\nIn the priesthood we share the sacred duty to labor for the souls of men. We must do more than learn that this is our duty. It must go down into our hearts so deeply that neither the many demands on our efforts in the bloom of life nor the trials that come with age can turn us from that purpose.\nNot long ago I visited a high priest in his home. He is no longer able to come to our quorum meetings. He lives alone. His beautiful wife died, and his children live far away from him. Time and illness limit his ability to serve. He still lifts weights to keep what he can of his once-powerful strength.\nWhen I walked into his home, he stood up from his walker to greet me. He invited me to sit in a chair near him. We talked of our happy associations in the priesthood.\nThen with great intensity he said to me, \u201cWhy am I still living? Why am I still here? I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\nI told him that he was doing something for me. He was lifting me with his faith and his love. Even in our short visit, he made me want to be better. His example of determination to do something that mattered had inspired me to try harder to serve others and the Lord.\nBut from the sad sound of his voice and the look in his eyes, I could sense that I had not answered his questions. He still wondered why God let him live with such limitations on his ability to serve.\nIn his usual generous way, he thanked me for coming to see him. As I got up to leave, the nurse who comes to his home a few hours every day walked in from another room. During our private conversation, he had told me a little about her. He said she was wonderful. She had lived among the Latter-day Saints most of her life but was still not a member.\nShe walked up to show me to the door. He motioned toward her and said with a smile, \u201cSee, I can\u2019t seem to do anything. I have been trying to get her baptized into the Church, but it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d She smiled back at him and at me. I walked outside and turned toward my home nearby.\nI realized then that the answers to his questions were planted long ago in his heart. That valiant high priest was trying to do his duty, taught to him through decades in the priesthood.\nHe knew that the only way that young woman could have the blessing of salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ was to make a covenant by being baptized. He had been taught according to the covenants by every president of every quorum from the deacons to the high priests.\nHe remembered and felt his own oath and covenant in the priesthood. He was still keeping it.\nHe was a witness and a missionary for the Savior wherever life would take him. It was already in his heart. The desire of his heart was that her heart could be changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ by keeping sacred covenants.\nHis time in the school of the priesthood in this life will be relatively brief compared to eternity. But even in that short span, he has mastered the eternal curriculum. He will carry with him, wherever the Lord will call, priesthood lessons of eternal worth.\nNot only should you be eager to learn your priesthood lessons in this life, but you should be optimistic about what is possible. A few of us may limit in our minds our possibilities to learn what the Lord sets before us in His service.\nOne young man left his little Welsh village in the early 1840s, heard the Apostles of God, and came into the kingdom of God on earth. He sailed with the Saints to America and drove a wagon west across the plains. He was in the next company after Brigham Young coming into this valley. His priesthood service included clearing and breaking ground for a farm.\nHe sold the farm for pennies on the dollar to go on a mission for the Lord in the deserts of what is now Nevada to take care of sheep. He was called from that to another mission across the ocean in the very village he had left in his poverty to follow the Lord.\nThrough it all, he found a way to learn with his priesthood brethren. Bold missionary that he was, he walked down the lane in Wales to the summer estate of a man who was four times the prime minister of England to offer him the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThe great man let him into his mansion. He was a graduate of Eton College and of Oxford University. The missionary talked with him about the origins of man, the central role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, and even the fate of nations.\nAt the end of their discussion, the host declined the offer to accept baptism. But as they parted, that leader of one of the great empires of the world asked the humble missionary, \u201cWhere did you get your education?\u201d His answer: \u201cIn the priesthood of God.\u201d\nYou may have thought at one time how much better your life would have been if only you had been admitted to study in some fine school. I pray that you will see the greatness of God\u2019s love for you and of the opportunity He has given you to enter His priesthood school.\nIf you will be diligent and obedient in the priesthood, treasures of spiritual knowledge will be poured out upon you. You will grow in your power to resist evil and to proclaim the truth that leads to salvation. You will find joy in the happiness of those you lead toward exaltation. Your family will become a place of learning.\nI testify that the keys of the priesthood have been restored. President Thomas S. Monson holds and exercises those keys. God lives and knows you perfectly. Jesus Christ lives. You were chosen for the honor of holding the sacred priesthood. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nHenry B.

The demands of everyday life\u2014education, jobs, raising children, Church administration and callings, worldly activities, and even the pain and sorrow of unexpected illness and tragedy\u2014can wear us down. How can we free ourselves from this tangled web of challenges and uncertainties to find peace of mind and happiness?\nOftentimes we are like the young merchant from Boston, who in 1849, as the story goes, was caught up in the fervor of the California gold rush. He sold all of his possessions to seek his fortune in the California rivers, which he was told were filled with gold nuggets so big that one could hardly carry them.\nDay after endless day, the young man dipped his pan into the river and came up empty. His only reward was a growing pile of rocks. Discouraged and broke, he was ready to quit until one day an old, experienced prospector said to him, \u201cThat\u2019s quite a pile of rocks you are getting there, my boy.\u201d\nThe young man replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no gold here. I\u2019m going back home.\u201d\nWalking over to the pile of rocks, the old prospector said, \u201cOh, there is gold all right. You just have to know where to find it.\u201d He picked two rocks up in his hands and crashed them together. One of the rocks split open, revealing several flecks of gold sparkling in the sunlight.\nNoticing a bulging leather pouch fastened to the prospector\u2019s waist, the young man said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for nuggets like the ones in your pouch, not just tiny flecks.\u201d\nThe old prospector extended his pouch toward the young man, who looked inside, expecting to see several large nuggets. He was stunned to see that the pouch was filled with thousands of flecks of gold.\nThe old prospector said, \u201cSon, it seems to me you are so busy looking for large nuggets that you\u2019re missing filling your pouch with these precious flecks of gold. The patient accumulation of these little flecks has brought me great wealth.\u201d\nThis story illustrates the spiritual truth that Alma taught his son Helaman:\n\u201cBy small and simple things are great things brought to pass. \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 And by very small means the Lord \u2026 bringeth about the salvation of many souls\u201d (Alma 37:6\u20137).\nBrothers and sisters, the gospel of Jesus Christ is simple, no matter how much we try to make it complicated. We should strive to keep our lives similarly simple, unencumbered by extraneous influences, focused on those things that matter most.\nWhat are the precious, simple things of the gospel that bring clarity and purpose to our lives? What are the flecks of gospel gold whose patient accumulation over the course of our lifetime will reward us with the ultimate treasure\u2014the precious gift of eternal life?\nI believe there is one simple but profound\u2014even sublime\u2014principle that encompasses the entirety of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If we wholeheartedly embrace this principle and make it the focus of our lives, it will purify and sanctify us so we can live once again in the presence of God.\nThe Savior spoke of this principle when He answered the Pharisee who asked, \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\n\u201cJesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.\n\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (Matthew 22:36\u201340).\nIt is only when we love God and Christ with all of our hearts, souls, and minds that we are able to share this love with our neighbors through acts of kindness and service\u2014the way that the Savior would love and serve all of us if He were among us today.\nWhen this pure love of Christ\u2014or charity\u2014envelops us, we think, feel, and act more like Heavenly Father and Jesus would think, feel, and act. Our motivation and heartfelt desire are like unto that of the Savior. He shared this desire with His Apostles on the eve of His Crucifixion. He said:\n\u201cA new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you. \u2026\n\u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another\u201d (John 13:34\u201335).\nThe love the Savior described is an active love. It is not manifested through large and heroic deeds but rather through simple acts of kindness and service.\nThere are myriad ways and circumstances in which we can serve and love others. May I suggest just a few.\nFirst, charity begins at home. The single most important principle that should govern every home is to practice the Golden Rule\u2014the Lord\u2019s admonition that \u201call things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them\u201d (Matthew 7:12). Take a moment and imagine how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of thoughtless words or actions. By our example, let us teach our family members to have love one for another.\nAnother place where we have ample opportunity to serve is in the Church. Our wards and branches should be places where the Golden Rule always guides our words and actions toward each other. By treating each other kindly, speaking words of support and encouragement, and being sensitive to each other\u2019s needs, we can create loving unity among ward members. Where charity exists, there is no place for gossip or unkind words.\nWard members, both adults and youth, can unite in meaningful service to bless the lives of others. Just two weeks ago, the President of the South America Northwest Area, Elder Marcus B. Nash of the Seventy, reported that by assigning \u201cthe strong in spirit to those that are weak,\u201d they are rescuing hundreds of less-active adults and youth. Through love and service, \u201cone by one\u201d they are coming back. These acts of kindness create a strong and lasting bond among everyone involved\u2014both the helpers and the helpees. So many precious memories are centered around such service.\nWhen I think back on my many years of Church administration, some of my most profound memories are the times I joined with ward members to help someone.\nFor example, I remember as a bishop working alongside several active members of my ward as we cleaned out the silage pit at the stake welfare farm. This was not a pleasant assignment! A less-active brother who had not been to church for many years was invited to join with us. Because of the love and fellowship he felt with us as we worked and talked in that smelly silage pit, he came back to church and was later sealed in the temple to his wife and his children. Our fellowship through service has blessed his children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren. Many of them have served missions, have married in the temple, and are raising an eternal family\u2014a great work wrought by a simple act, a small fleck of gold.\nA third area where we can serve is in our communities. As a pure expression of our love and concern, we can reach out to those who have need of our help. Many of you have put on Helping Hands T-shirts and worked tirelessly to relieve suffering and improve your communities. Young single adults in the Sendai Japan Stake recently provided invaluable service in searching for members in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami. There are countless ways to serve.\nThrough our heartfelt kindness and service, we can make friends with those whom we serve. From these friendships come better understanding of our devotion to the gospel and a desire to learn more about us.\nMy good friend Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin talked of the power of this principle when he said: \u201cKindness is the essence of greatness. \u2026 [It] is a passport that opens doors and fashions friends. It softens hearts and molds relationships that can last lifetimes\u201d (\u201cThe Virtue of Kindness,\u201d Liahona and Ensign, May 2005, 26).\nAnother way we can serve Heavenly Father\u2019s children is through missionary service\u2014not only as full-time missionaries but also as friends and neighbors. The future growth of the Church will not happen through just knocking on strangers\u2019 doors. It will happen when the members, along with our missionaries, filled with the love of God and Christ discern needs and respond to those needs in the spirit of charitable service.\nWhen we do this, brothers and sisters, the honest in heart will feel our sincerity and our love. Many will want to know more about us. Then and only then will the Church expand to fill all of the earth. This cannot be accomplished by missionaries alone but requires the interest and service of every member.\nIn all of our service, we need to be sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The still, small voice will let us know who needs our help and what we can do to help them.\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball said: \u201cIt is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom. \u2026 So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving \u2026 help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow \u2026 from small but deliberate deeds!\u201d (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 82).\nAnd President Thomas S. Monson has counseled:\n\u201cThe needs of others are ever present, and each of us can do something to help someone.\n\u201c\u2026 Unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives\u201d (\u201cWhat Have I Done for Someone Today?\u201d Liahona and Ensign, Nov. 2009, 85).\nBrothers and sisters, may I reemphasize that the most important attribute of Heavenly Father and of His Beloved Son that we should desire and seek to possess within our lives is the gift of charity, \u201cthe pure love of Christ\u201d (Moroni 7:47). From this gift springs our capacity to love and to serve others as the Savior did.\nThe prophet Mormon taught us the supreme importance of this gift and told us how we can receive it: \u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure\u201d (Moroni 7:48).\nGreat things are wrought through simple and small things. Like the small flecks of gold that accumulate over time into a large treasure, our small and simple acts of kindness and service will accumulate into a life filled with love for Heavenly Father, devotion to the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, and a sense of peace and joy each time we reach out to one another.\nAs we approach the Easter season, may we show our love and appreciation for the Savior\u2019s atoning sacrifice through our simple, compassionate acts of service to our brothers and sisters at home, at church, and in our communities. For this I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nM. Russell Ballard\nFinding Joy through Loving Service\n2011\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "We live in perilous times when many believe we are not accountable to God and that we do not have personal responsibility or stewardship for ourselves or others. Many in the world are focused on self-gratification, put themselves first, and love pleasure more than they love righteousness. They do not believe they are their brother\u2019s keeper. In the Church, however, we believe that these stewardships are a sacred trust.\nRecently a group of highly respected Jewish leaders and rabbis visited Church facilities in the Salt Lake Valley, including Welfare Square, the Humanitarian Center, the Family History Library, and the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house. At the conclusion of their visit, one of the most eminent rabbis in America expressed his feelings about what he had seen and felt.1\nHe cited concepts from Jewish thinkers rooted in the Talmud2 and pointed out that there are two very different reasons people engage in acts of kindness and generosity. Some people visit the sick, assist the poor, and serve their fellowmen because they believe it is the right thing to do and others will reciprocate and do the same for them when they are in need. He explained that while this is good, builds caring communities, and should be considered a noble reason, a higher motive is when we serve our fellowmen because that is what we believe God wants us to do.\nHe stated that as a result of his visit, he believed the Latter-day Saints undertake welfare and humanitarian efforts and the work of salvation in our temples in order to do what we believe God wants us to do.\nThis feeling of accountability, which is encompassed by the first great commandment to love God, has been described by some as \u201cobedience to the unenforceable.\u201d3 We try to do what is right because we love and want to please our Father in Heaven, not because someone is forcing us to obey.\nThe War in Heaven was fought after Satan said that he would force everyone to obey his ideas. That was rejected. As a result, we have our moral agency and the freedom to choose our course in this life. But we also are accountable for that agency. The Lord has said we will be \u201caccountable for [our] own sins in the day of judgment.\u201d4 The principles of accountability and stewardship have great significance in our doctrine.5\nIn the Church, stewardship is not limited to a temporal trust or responsibility. President Spencer W. Kimball taught: \u201cWe are stewards over our bodies, minds, families, and properties. \u2026 A faithful steward is one who exercises righteous dominion, cares for his own, and looks to the poor and needy.\u201d6\nWhile there are many areas of stewardship, I have chosen to address two. The first is stewardship of ourselves and our families. The second is stewardship for the poor and needy.\nThe Lord often used parables relating to the land in teaching accountability and stewardship. When I was a small boy, I would visit my grandparents at their ranch during the summer. There was no electrical power, running water, or indoor plumbing. There was, however, a spring of water next to their small ranch house. The spring created a little pond of clear, pure water, where several times a day I would help my grandmother carry water to the house for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes. My grandparents loved this life-giving spring and took special precautions to protect it.\nMany years later my grandfather was in his early 90s and did not live on the property; he was unable to maintain or oversee it. I drove him to see the ranch which he loved. His high expectations at seeing the ranch turned to disappointment when he realized the fences that protected the spring had fallen into disrepair and cows had damaged the spring and the precious, pure springwater had been significantly polluted. He was upset with the damage and the pollution. To him, it was a violation of a trust he had observed all his working life. He felt somehow he had not protected that life-sustaining spring which had meant so much to him.\nJust as the pure spring was polluted when not protected, we live in a time when virtue and chastity are not safeguarded.7 The eternal significance of personal morality is not respected. A loving Father in Heaven has provided us with the means to bring His spirit children into this world to fulfill the full measure of their creation. He has instructed us that the wellsprings of life are to be kept pure, just as the beautiful spring on the ranch required protection in order to sustain life. This is one of the reasons why virtue and chastity are so important in our Father in Heaven\u2019s plan.\nBecause of my grandfather\u2019s reaction to the polluted spring, improvements and protections were undertaken which returned the spring to its original beauty and purity.\nAs servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is our sacred responsibility to teach His standard of morality, which is the same for all of His children. When our thoughts or our actions are impure, we violate His standard. The Lord has said, \u201cI \u2026 cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\u201d8 Some attempt to rationalize away their conduct.\nIn a poem by John Holmes titled \u201cTalk,\u201d an old, deaf New England shipbuilder teaches a young man about rationalization. In describing one of the lessons he learned, the youth explains, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known that however you build it, the ship must sail; you can\u2019t explain to the ocean.\u201d9\nIt has been suggested that what happens in a certain city stays in a certain city. I like the sign posted in Sevier County, Utah, which states, \u201cWhat happens in Sevier County \u2026 you can share with your friends!!!\u201d When we realize that we are accountable to God, we see how foolish rationalizations can be. Those who rationalize remind us of little children who cover their eyes, convinced that if they can\u2019t see us, we can\u2019t see them. I would suggest that if we think about giving an accounting of our actions to the Savior, our rationalizations will be seen in their true light.\nWe are aware that there are those who have already engaged in conduct inconsistent with this sacred standard of morality. Please understand that through the Savior\u2019s Atonement, all can repent and return, like the spring of water, to a clean and pure state. It is difficult to repent; it requires a broken heart and a contrite spirit.10 But when the steps to repentance are righteously followed, the words spoken by the prophet Alma to his son Corianton, who had been involved in moral transgressions, are applicable: \u201cAnd now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.\u201d11 The Savior has said, \u201cBehold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.\u201d12\nWith respect to our stewardship for our families, some have taught that when we report to the Savior and He asks us to give an account of our earthly responsibilities, two important inquiries will relate to our families. The first will be our relationship with our spouse, and the second will be about each of our children.13\nIt is easy to confuse our priorities. We have a duty to secure the physical safety and well-being of our children. However, some parents place undue priority on temporal and material possessions. Some are far less diligent in their efforts to immerse their children in the gospel of Jesus Christ.14 Remember that having religious observance in the home is as important as providing food, clothing, and shelter. Parents can also help children discover and develop their talents. We are responsible for the talents we have received. Children who are not taught that they are accountable for their time and talents are increasingly subject to the foolishness and unrighteousness that are so pervasive in the world.15 The family proclamation warns that individuals \u201cwho fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God.\u201d16\nThe second stewardship is caring for the poor and those in need, which applies to virtually all of us at one time or another. The Lord\u2019s admonition that we are stewards for those in need contains some of the strongest language in all of scripture: \u201cIf any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion \u2026 unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.\u201d17 We are accountable as stewards over earthly blessings, which the Lord has provided.\nThe Jewish leaders I mentioned earlier were particularly impressed with the principle of fasting and then paying a generous fast offering. They thought it was remarkable that Church members across the world would fast monthly and then make a freewill offering for the benefit of those who are in need.\nWhen the rabbis visited Welfare Square, they were touched to learn that even in difficult economic times, our members, concerned about the challenges experienced by many, continue to donate generously to help the poor and needy.\nI can remember when I was called as a bishop, my predecessor, Bishop Russell Johnson, warned me that I would have to be careful what I asked the members to do. He said, \u201cSome will respond to every suggestion, even at great sacrifice.\u201d He mentioned one widow in her 80s who had cared for both a husband and a son through long illnesses before they passed away. Bishop Johnson said that despite having small resources, she would always try to respond. I found this to be true. Every time I mentioned the need for contributions or service to bless others, Sarah was often the first to respond.\nOne Saturday another sister called me and said, \u201cBishop, come quick! Save Sarah!\u201d This sister reported that 80-year-old Sarah was on top of a ladder cleaning out this neighbor\u2019s rain gutters. This sister was terrified that Sarah would fall and wanted the bishop to intervene.\nI am not suggesting that everyone can or should imitate Sarah. Some feel guilty because they cannot meet every need immediately. I love the quote Elder Neal A. Maxwell often used from Anne Morrow Lindbergh: \u201cMy life cannot implement in action the demands of all the people to whom my heart responds.\u201d18 King Benjamin taught, \u201cSee that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.\u201d19 But he added that we should be diligent.\nMy heart rejoices as I observe the Saints all over the Church doing everything they can to provide Christlike service wherever there is a need. Because of member contributions, the Church can quietly and quickly, without fanfare, respond to needs all over the world.20 The Church is already responding to the natural disasters in the Philippines, the Pacific Islands, and Indonesia.\nLast year our members responded to Hurricane Gustav. The Church worked closely with a humanitarian organization led by Martin Luther King III. Mr. King subsequently visited Salt Lake City and said: \u201cI originally came to express my appreciation to the Church for their humanitarian support, but I quickly learned that the essence of who you are is so much deeper and profound. Between the Humanitarian Center, Welfare Square, and the temple open house, I now have a greater appreciation for why you do what you do.\u201d\nIn all of our stewardship efforts, we follow Jesus Christ. We try to emulate what He has asked us to do, both by His teachings and His example. With all our hearts we express our appreciation to the membership of the Church for their generous contributions and Christlike service.\nIsaiah, speaking of the fast and feeding the hungry and clothing the naked, in touching language promised, \u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer.\u201d21 Isaiah continues: \u201cAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; \u2026 the Lord shall guide thee continually, \u2026 and thou shalt be like \u2026 a spring of water, whose waters fail not. \u2026 [And] thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations.\u201d22\nMy hope is that each of us will review individually and as families the stewardships for which we have responsibility and accountability. I pray that we will do so knowing we are ultimately accountable to God and that in this life we will be adhering to the unenforceable.\nI am grateful for the counsel of a loving, faithful prophet to serve and rescue those in need. As we follow his counsel, I know we will qualify for the Lord\u2019s promise: \u201cAnd whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.\u201d23\nI bear my witness of this sacred truth in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nQuentin L. Cook\nStewardship\u2014a Sacred Trust\n2009\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My beloved brethren and sisters, what a miracle it is that we are able to address you out across the world. We speak here in the Conference Center in Salt Lake City. We speak in our native tongue. But many thousands of you are assembled in Church facilities in many lands, and you hear us in 56 languages.\nWe are met again in a great world conference of the Church according to the will and instruction of the Lord.\nAs we do so, the world is in turmoil. There is war and contention. There is much of unrest. Members of the Church family are citizens of many nations. We find ourselves on both sides of a great debate. I intend to speak about this tomorrow morning.\nBut with all the troubles with which we are confronted, I am pleased to report that the work of the Church moves forward. We continue to grow across the world. Our missionary work goes on without serious impediment. Converts continue to come into the Church, and our numbers are constantly being increased. Paralleling this activity is the need to solidly integrate all of those who are baptized as converts. We call upon every member of the Church to reach out to new converts, to put your arms around them and make them feel at home. Bless them with your friendship. Encourage them with your faith. See that there are no losses among them. Every man, woman, or child worthy of baptism is worthy of a secure and friendly situation in which to grow in the Church and its many activities.\nOur sacrament meeting attendance gradually edges up. There is room for improvement, and I urge you to work at it constantly. Even so, I do not know of another church with as high a percentage of consistent attendance at its meetings.\nI am so grateful for the strength of the youth of the Church. Sadly enough, some fall between the cracks. But it is a miracle to witness the strength of our young people in the midst of all of the sordid temptation that is constantly around them. The sleaze and the filth of pornography, the temptation to partake of drugs, the titillating invitation to drop all bars on sexual behavior, these are among some of the enticing attractions they constantly face. Notwithstanding the allurement of the world in which they live, they remain true to the faith of their fathers and the gospel they love. I cannot say enough of good concerning our wonderful young people.\nFaith in the payment of tithes and offerings increases despite the straitened economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. We are able to go forward with the building of meetinghouses and temples, with our vast education program, with the very many activities which are conditioned upon the tithing income of the Church. I promise you that we will not put the Church in debt. We will strictly tailor the program to the tithing income and use these sacred funds for the purposes designated by the Lord.\nI call attention to that which has received much notice in the local press. This is our decision to purchase the shopping mall property immediately to the south of Temple Square.\nWe feel we have a compelling responsibility to protect the environment of the Salt Lake Temple. The Church owns most of the ground on which this mall stands. The owners of the buildings have expressed a desire to sell. The property needs very extensive and expensive renovation. We have felt it imperative to do something to revitalize this area. But I wish to give the entire Church the assurance that tithing funds have not and will not be used to acquire this property. Nor will they be used in developing it for commercial purposes.\nFunds for this have come and will come from those commercial entities owned by the Church. These resources, together with the earnings of invested reserve funds, will accommodate this program.\nI am pleased to report that we are able to go forward with the building of chapels. We are constructing about 400 new chapels a year to accommodate the growth in the membership of the Church. This is a significant and wonderful thing for which we are deeply grateful. We are also continuing to build temples across the earth and are pleased to report an increase in temple activity. This very important work, in behalf of the living and the dead, is a fundamental part of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWe are pleased to note an increase in family preparedness among our people. This program, which has been advocated for more than 60 years, adds immeasurably to the security and well-being of the Latter-day Saints. Every family has a responsibility to the extent possible to provide for its own needs. We again urge our people to avoid unnecessary debt, to be modest in the financial obligations which they undertake, to set aside some cash against an emergency. We warn our people against \u201cget rich\u201d schemes and other entanglements which are nearly always designed to trap the gullible.\nI am constantly amazed at the vast amount of volunteer service which our people give. I am convinced that volunteer service is the Lord\u2019s way of accomplishing His work. The operation of wards and stakes and quorums, and the functions of the auxiliary organizations, all move forward under the direction of volunteers. The vast missionary program is dependent on volunteer service.\nAdditionally, we have a large number of older members who serve in a Church-service missionary capacity. More than 18,000 give all or a large part of their time to this work. We thank them for their dedicated service.\nThis conference marks the second anniversary of the establishment of the Perpetual Education Fund. I am pleased to report that this program is now going forward on a solid basis. Some 8,000 young men and women are now in training to improve their skills and their employment opportunities. On average, with the two years of education they are now receiving, they are increasing their income some four and a half times. It is a miracle!\nAnd so I might go on. Suffice it to say, the Church is in good condition. I believe its affairs are prudently handled. Our people are growing in faith, in love for the Lord, and in adherence to His teachings.\nThese are difficult times. The economy is struggling. There is conflict in the world. But the Almighty is keeping His promise that He will bless those who walk in faith and righteousness before Him.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is the way of peace. To the extent we follow it and incorporate it in our lives, to this extent will we be blessed and prospered. What a wonderful thing it is to be involved in this glorious work. Let us rejoice in our great opportunity. Let us serve with gladness.\nMay heaven\u2019s richest blessings rest upon you, my beloved associates. May faith grow in your hearts. May there be love and peace in your homes. May there be food upon your tables and clothing on your backs. May the smiles of heaven warm your hearts and bring comfort in times of trial. This is my prayer this morning as we open this great conference, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nGordon B. Hinckley\nThe Condition of the Church\n2003\nSaturday Morning Session\n"}, {"text": "In a recent meeting, President Marion G. Romney gave a message which impressed me greatly. First he said, \u201cIt has been, and now is, the desire and the objective of the Church to obtain from fast offerings the necessary funds to meet the cash needs of the welfare program.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe can, we ought, and we must do better.\u201d Then from Brother Romney came this comforting assurance: \u201cIf we will double our fast offerings we shall increase our prosperity, both spiritually and temporally. This the Lord has promised, this has been the record.\u201d\nMany years ago a day was chosen and designated upon which to observe the law of the fast. A very important feature in this observance was, and now is, a liberal contribution to the fast offering fund. The policy of the Church today has been stated as follows:\n\u201cThe first Sunday of each month is usually designated as a day of fasting and prayer on which a special testimony meeting is held. Adequate time should be allowed for testimony bearing. \u2026\n\u201cA proper fast day observance consists of abstaining from food and drink for two consecutive meals, attending the fast and testimony meeting, and making a generous offering to the bishop for the care of those in need. A minimum fast offering is defined as the equivalent of the value of two meals.\u201d (General Handbook of Instructions [1968], p. 40.)\nSunday, however, has not always been the day when fasting and testimony bearing has been observed in the Church. President Joseph Fielding Smith has furnished us with a very interesting account of the development of this law and principle. He said:\n\u201cFasting and prayer in the present dispensation have been carried over from primitive times. From the organization of the Church the principle of fasting in the spirit of prayer has been a commandment of the Lord. [See D&C 59:8\u201313; D&C 88:76, 119.] In regard to the choosing of a set day of the month, we have this testimony coming from President Brigham Young in a discourse [which was delivered] in the old tabernacle, [in] Salt Lake City, [on] December 8, 1867.\n\u201cPresident Young said, \u2018\u2026 You know that the first Thursday in each month we hold \u2026 fast day. How many here know the origin of this day? Before tithing was paid, the poor were supported by donations. They came to [the Prophet] Joseph \u2026 and wanted help, in Kirtland, and he said there should be a fast day, which was decided upon. It was to be held once a month, as it is now, and all that would have been eaten that day, of flour, or meat, or butter, or fruit, or anything else, was to be carried to the fast meeting and put in the hands of a person selected for the purpose of taking care of the poor. If we were to do this now faithfully, [said President Young] do you think the poor would lack for flour, or butter, or cheese, or meat, or sugar, or anything they needed to eat? No! there would be more than could be used by all the poor among us. \u2026\u2019\u201d\nPresident Smith then explained:\n\u201cThis custom of holding fast meetings on Thursday was continued in Nauvoo and also after the coming of the members of the Church to the Rocky Mountains. I can remember the time when certain business houses closed their doors each fast day and placed on the doors, \u2018Closed for fast meeting.\u2019 \u2026\n\u201cThe change from the first Thursday to the first Sunday of the month came about in this manner. Hyrum M. Smith, who later became a member of the Council of the Twelve, was a missionary in Newcastle, England, in the year 1896. On the Thursday of the fast meeting, members of the Church in that land had to get excused from their employment with a loss of pay. Some of them were workers in the coal mines. When these came from the pits, they had to go home, bathe, and change their clothes. This was a loss both of time and compensation. Hyrum wrote to his father, President Joseph F. Smith, and asked why, under such circumstances, the fast day had to be a Thursday and not a Sunday. President Smith took the letter to the meeting of the First Presidency and the apostles and presented it there. The following is an excerpt from the minutes of the meeting held November 5, 1896:\n\u201c\u2018President Joseph F. Smith introduced the subject of fast meetings, suggesting that a change of the time from the first Thursday to the first Sunday in each month would probably be beneficial. This was endorsed by President George Q. Cannon, and after other brethren had spoken on the subject, it was decided that the Tabernacle services would be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that the saints in this city as well as in the country wards, should have the privilege of meeting in their meeting houses at 2 o\u2019clock P.M. to observe fast day.\u2019\u201d (Improvement Era, Dec. 1956, p. 895.)\nIn addition to there being a change in the day of holding fast meeting and observing the law of the fast, one other development should be noted. When the Prophet Joseph set up the program in Kirtland in the early days of the Church, the Saints were counseled to bring to the fast meeting the items of food from which they had abstained. Subsequently this method has been modified so that currently the deacons of the Church call monthly on their assigned homes and the fast offering contribution is made in cash.\nMiracles are brought about through fasting and sincere prayer. In 1850 Lorenzo Snow, who later became president of the Church, labored in Italy as a missionary, trying to open that country to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was somewhat shy and self-conscious, but spiritually, he was a giant. One family who had befriended him had a critically ill child. In fact, Elder Snow realized that only through sincere fasting, mighty prayer, unswerving faith, and through the power of the priesthood could that three-year-old child be saved. He knew how much the healing of this boy would mean to the people in this small Italian village.\nClimbing with his companion to a place of seclusion on the foothills of the Alps just above the village, in the spirit of fasting and prayer, he earnestly petitioned and pleaded with the Lord for six long, anxious hours for the privilege of using divine power to heal that little boy. Finally, the answer came; the reply was yes, he would be granted the privilege.\nAs a humble servant of the Lord, he walked down the mountainside with perfect faith that the dying child\u2019s life would be spared. The boy was then given a blessing and a promise that he would live. A few hours later when Elder Snow and his companion returned to the home, they found that the child was greatly improved and was well on the way to recovery. Elder Snow realized that his fasting and prayer had reached the throne of a benevolent Heavenly Father. He remarked to the grateful parents: \u201cThe God of heaven has done this for you.\u201d (See Eliza R. Snow, Biography of Lorenzo Snow, pp. 128\u201329.)\nSurely the law of the fast is an inspired program and its observance has many virtues. President David O. McKay summed them up in these words:\n\u201cThe word fast is used to signify a self-imposed restraint with respect to the eating of food. Historians tell us that the custom of fasting dates back to the early history of the human race. \u2026\n\u201cWhatever its origin, it is significant to note that several virtues are attached to the observance of the custom. \u2026 All the principles associated with fasting seem to point to the fact that it produces, first, physical well-being; [then, self-mastery; next, an opportunity to help others, and finally,] spiritual strength.\n\u201cBut the greatest of all [the] benefits [from fasting is] the spiritual strength derived by the subjection of physical appetite to the will of the individual.\u201d (See David O. McKay, Gospel Ideals, Improvement Era, 1953, pp. 208\u2013213.)\nAn extremely important factor of the fast day observance is attending the fast and testimony meeting and acknowledging and expressing gratitude to our Heavenly Father for his many blessings.\nIt seems to me that there are four factors involved in a proper observance of the fast day, namely: first, abstaining; then, praying; next, testifying; and finally, contributing.\nI am confident that each of us has a continual need for additional blessings. A devoted servant of the Lord, a member of the First Presidency, has given us the formula, which, if followed, will increase our blessings. Again may I repeat his inspired promise: \u201cIf we will double our fast offerings we shall increase our prosperity, both spiritually and temporally.\u201d\nI firmly believe that the paying of fast offerings does result in rich blessings. And to this I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\nHenry D. Taylor\nThe Law of the Fast\n1974\nFriday morning session\n"}, {"text": "We have an International Mission in the Church, over which Elder Carlos Asay presides. It cares for all the members of the Church who live outside the boundaries of regularly established stakes and missions. This includes the families who live in far-distant countries away from the centers of the Church. These families generally are on assignment with the government or with the military, or work for international corporations.\nTypical of these is a family down in the Indian Ocean on the island of R\u00e9union. There is a family of eight living in Benghazi, Libya. Another family of five lives in Karachi, Pakistan. For these and many other families there is no organized unit of the Church. They have to teach their own children.\nMany of these families regularly conduct \u201cchurch\u201d services. Actually they are \u201chome\u201d services for their family. The mother may gather her small children about her and hold Primary. In this case she serves as the president of the Primary, the counselor, the teacher\u2014and always the janitor. If the family has priesthood-age sons, all the regular priesthood offices somehow merge into one\u2014the father\u2014as he teaches them their duties and ministers to his family.\nActually, where the Church is fully organized, priesthood and auxiliary leaders are striving to have all parents teach their children anyway.\nOften these distant families receive only a few basic materials from the Church. We now have available an excellent basic lesson manual for the men and boys and one for the mothers and daughters, a manual for small children, and a very fine basic manual, Gospel Principles. Generally these families receive the Church periodicals and have access to the family home evening manual, and, most important, the standard works of the Church. Activities are planned and centered around their families. In spite of limited materials, if the parents teach their children the gospel, these homes may be as blessed as any in the Church.\nThe things that are essential to these homes are essential in every home. In fact, living away from the organized Church might even be a blessing, because family members draw closer together and because they cannot delegate to the Church things that a father and mother should do wherever they live in the world.\nThe Lord organized the family unit in the beginning. He intended that the home be the center of learning\u2014that the father and mother be teachers. He has given counsel that applies whether the family lives within or without the boundaries of an organized unit of the Church. I cite but a few of the scores of verses:\n\u201cAnd they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord\u201d (D&C 68:28).\n\u201cThe glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. \u2026 I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth\u201d (D&C 93:36, 40).\n\u201cBut ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another\u201d (Mosiah 4:15).\n\u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\u201d (Prov. 22:6).\nThe Lord fixed families to give parents more influence on children than all other agencies combined. There is safety in this arrangement. It provides parents the privilege, the awesome privilege, of molding the life and character of a child, even though outside agencies have influence.\nParenthood imposes a singular responsibility. Not only must parents put good things into the minds of children, we must keep bad things out. That is why we have been cautioned against the unrestricted invasion of our homes by the media. While some agencies that have influence on our children are good, some are not. Parental vigilance should be constant. Safeguard your children against those who seek to destroy them.\nHow would you pass the test, parents, if your family was isolated from the Church and you had to supply all religious training? Have you become so dependent on others that you do little or nothing at home? Tell me, how much of the gospel would your children know, if all they knew is what they had been taught at home? Ponder that. I repeat, how much of the gospel would your children know if all they knew is what they had been taught at home? Remember, the Church exists to help the home. Parents, the divine charge to teach has never been changed. Do not abdicate your duty.\nWe have been counseled to become self-reliant and independent temporally. It is as important spiritually! Suppose conditions changed. Suppose you could not receive all the services to which you have become accustomed. Suppose that much more responsibility were placed on your shoulders to care for the spiritual welfare of your family. Surely you cannot study the scriptures without knowing that perilous times are coming. Will you be unaffected?\nPrepare now! Take steps now to strengthen your family. Spend time together. Establish and maintain family traditions that build happy memories. Maintain a discipline with fair rules and regulations. Express unconditional love to one another through word and act. Develop within each one self-esteem and self-respect by loving and believing in him and having him belong. Provide security that children need. These are the values of which life is made. Establish these, and then we won\u2019t need to worry about the frills that too often concern us.\nAs prophetic events unfold, one thing is certain: we will need to be more self-reliant. We will all need to teach more within the walls of our own homes. In the Book of Mormon we find some models:\n\u201cI, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father\u201d (1 Ne. 1:1). No doubt Nephi was taught the things of the Spirit\u2014his writings reveal that. He probably was taught practical matters as well, for he was a very resourceful man. Today that son is fortunate whose father teaches him somewhat in all his learning.\nEnos, son of Jacob, was another who esteemed his father:\n\u201cI, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man\u2014for he taught me \u2026 in the nurture and admonition of the Lord\u2014and blessed be the name of my God for it. \u2026\n\u201cBehold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.\n\u201cAnd my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul\u201d (Enos 1:1, 3\u20134).\nHis life of service pivoted on this great spiritual experience. This experience occurred because of the words of his father. These are great models. They are good examples of the power of parental teaching. One thing is essential. Parents and children must spend time together.\nSome few of us may receive public acclaim for our deeds. Most of us will live out our lives in comparative anonymity. This need not matter. Serve your fellowman. Love and teach your children. Then one day we will merit a tribute from them, which in the eternal plan will mean more than fame or wealth: \u201cI \u2026 [was] born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nA. Theodore Tuttle\nTherefore I Was Taught\n1979\nSaturday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "My brothers and sisters, my heart is full as we bring to a close this wonderful general conference of the Church. We have been spiritually fed as we have listened to the counsel and testimonies of those who have participated in each session. I am certain I speak for all members everywhere when I express deep appreciation for the truths we have been taught. We could echo the words, found in the Book of Mormon, of those who heard the sermon of the great King Benjamin and \u201ccried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent.\u201d1\nI hope that we will take the time to read the conference talks, which will be reprinted in the November issue of the Ensign and Liahona magazines, for they are deserving of our careful study.\nWhat a blessing it is that we have been able to meet here, in this magnificent Conference Center, in peace and comfort and safety. We have had unprecedented coverage of the conference, reaching across the continents and the oceans to people everywhere. Though we are far removed from many of you, we feel of your spirit and send our love and appreciation to you.\nTo our Brethren who have been released at this conference, may I express the heartfelt gratitude of all of us for your many years of devoted service. Countless are those who have been blessed by your contributions to the work of the Lord.\nThe Tabernacle Choir and other choirs which participated in the sessions have provided truly heavenly music that has enhanced and beautified all else which has taken place. I thank you for sharing with us your musical talents and abilities.\nI love and appreciate my faithful counselors, President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf. They are truly men of wisdom and understanding, and their service is invaluable. I could not do all that I am called upon to do without their support and assistance. I love and admire my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and all in the Quorums of the Seventy and in the Presiding Bishopric. They serve selflessly and effectively. I similarly express my appreciation for the women and men who serve as general auxiliary officers.\nHow blessed we are to have the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. It provides answers to questions concerning where we came from, why we are here, and where we will go when we pass from this life. It provides meaning and purpose and hope to our lives.\nWe live in a troubled world, a world of many challenges. We are here on this earth to deal with our individual challenges to the best of our ability, to learn from them, and to overcome them. Endure to the end we must, for our goal is eternal life in the presence of our Father in Heaven. He loves us and wants nothing more than for us to succeed in this goal. He will help us and bless us as we call upon Him in our prayers, as we study His words, and as we obey His commandments. Therein is found safety; therein is found peace.\nMay God bless you, my brothers and sisters. I thank you for your prayers in my behalf and in behalf of all of the General Authorities. We are deeply grateful for you and for all that you do to further the kingdom of God on earth.\nMay heaven\u2019s blessings be with you. May your homes be filled with love and courtesy and with the Spirit of the Lord. May you constantly nourish your testimonies of the gospel, that they will be a protection to you against the buffetings of Satan.\nConference is now over. As we return to our homes, may we do so safely. May the spirit we have felt here be and abide with us as we go about those things which occupy us each day. May we show increased kindness toward one another; may we ever be found doing the work of the Lord.\nI love you; I pray for you. I bid you farewell till we meet again in six months\u2019 time. In the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.\nThomas S. Monson\nTill We Meet Again\n2010\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "1 Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these things were spoken unto you for your aprofit and learning./n2 But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been given to the aelders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to bconduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit./n3 Nevertheless ye are commanded never to acast any one out from your public bmeetings, which are held before the world./n4 Ye are also commanded not to cast any one who belongeth to the church out of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have trespassed, let him anot bpartake until he makes reconciliation./n5 And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament meetings who are earnestly aseeking the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0094I speak this concerning those who are not of the church./n6 And again I say unto you, concerning your aconfirmation meetings, that if there be any that are not of the church, that are earnestly seeking after the kingdom, ye shall not cast them out./n7 But ye are commanded in all things to aask of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all bholiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, cconsidering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and dthanksgiving, that ye may not be eseduced by evil fspirits, or doctrines of devils, or the gcommandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils./n8 Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived aseek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;/n9 For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a asign that they may bconsume it upon their lusts./n10 And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your aminds what those bgifts are, that are given unto the church./n11 For all have not every agift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God./n12 To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby./n13 To some it is given by the aHoly Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world./n14 To others it is given to abelieve on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful./n15 And again, to some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know the adifferences of administration, as it will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as the Lord will, suiting his bmercies according to the conditions of the children of men./n16 And again, it is given by the Holy Ghost to some to know the diversities of operations, whether they be of God, that the manifestations of the aSpirit may be given to every man to profit withal./n17 And again, verily I say unto you, to some is given, by the Spirit of God, the word of awisdom./n18 To another is given the word of aknowledge, that all may be taught to be wise and to have knowledge./n19 And again, to some it is given to have afaith to be healed;/n20 And to others it is given to have faith to aheal./n21 And again, to some is given the working of amiracles;/n22 And to others it is given to aprophesy;/n23 And to others the adiscerning of spirits./n24 And again, it is given to some to speak with atongues;/n25 And to another is given the interpretation of tongues./n26 And all these agifts come from God, for the benefit of the bchildren of God./n27 And unto the abishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the church and to be elders unto the church, are to have it given unto them to bdiscern all those gifts lest there shall be any among you professing and yet be not of God./n28 And it shall come to pass that he that asketh in aSpirit shall receive in Spirit;/n29 That unto some it may be given to have all those gifts, that there may be a head, in order that every member may be profited thereby./n30 He that aasketh in the bSpirit asketh according to the cwill of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh./n31 And again, I say unto you, all things must be done in the name of Christ, whatsoever you do in the Spirit;/n32 And ye must give athanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with./n33 And ye must practice avirtue and holiness before me continually. Even so. Amen.\n"}, {"text": "I\u2019d like to begin by sharing a story that touches my heart.\nOne evening a man called his five sheep to come into the shelter for the night. His family watched with great interest as he simply called, \u201cCome on,\u201d and immediately all five heads lifted and turned in his direction. Four sheep broke into a run toward him. With loving-kindness he gently patted each of the four on the head. The sheep knew his voice and loved him.\nBut the fifth sheep didn\u2019t come running. She was a large ewe that a few weeks earlier had been given away by her owner, who reported that she was wild, wayward, and always leading the other sheep astray. The new owner accepted the sheep and staked her in his own field for a few days so she would learn to stay put. He patiently taught her to love him and the other sheep until eventually she had only a short rope around her neck but was no longer staked down.\nThat evening as his family watched, the man approached the ewe, which stood at the edge of the field, and again he gently said, \u201cCome on. You aren\u2019t tied down anymore. You are free.\u201d Then lovingly he reached out, placed his hand on her head, and walked back with her and the other sheep toward the shelter.1\nIn the spirit of that story, I pray that the Holy Ghost will help us learn together tonight about covenant keeping. Making and keeping covenants means choosing to bind ourselves to our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ. It is committing to follow the Savior. It is trusting Him and desiring to show our gratitude for the price He paid to set us free through the infinite gift of the Atonement.\nElder Jeffrey\u00a0R. Holland explained that \u201ca covenant is a binding spiritual contract, a solemn promise to God our Father that we will live and think and act in a certain way\u2014the way of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. In return, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost promise us the full splendor of eternal life.\u201d2 In that binding contract, the Lord sets the terms and we agree to keep them. Making and keeping our covenants is an expression of our commitment to become like the Savior.3 The ideal is to strive for the attitude best expressed in a few phrases of a favorite hymn: \u201cI\u2019ll go where you want me to go. \u2026 I\u2019ll say what you want me to say. \u2026 I\u2019ll be what you want me to be.\u201d4\nWhy Make and Keep Covenants?\n1. Covenant keeping strengthens, empowers, and protects.\nNephi saw in vision the significant blessings the Lord bestows upon covenant keepers: \u201cAnd it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended \u2026 upon the covenant people of the Lord, \u2026 and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.\u201d5\nI recently met a dear new friend. She testified that after she had received her temple endowment, she felt strengthened with the power to resist temptations she had previously struggled with.\nAs we keep our covenants, we also receive courage and strength to help us bear one another\u2019s burdens. A heartbroken sister had a son who was experiencing a difficult mortal challenge. Because of her faith in her Relief Society sisters as covenant keepers, she courageously invited them to fast and pray for her son. Another sister expressed how she wished she had asked for similar prayers from her sisters. Years before, her own son was struggling. She wished she had invited them to help her family bear this burden. The Savior said, \u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d6\nOh, sisters, we all have burdens to bear and burdens to share. An invitation to bear one another\u2019s burdens is an invitation to keep our covenants. Lucy Mack Smith\u2019s counsel to the first Relief Society sisters is more relevant today than ever before: \u201cWe must cherish one another, watch over one another, comfort one another and gain instruction, that we may all sit down in heaven together.\u201d7 This is covenant keeping and visiting teaching at its finest!\nThe Book of Mormon reminds us that even the prophet Alma had to bear the burden of having a rebellious son. But Alma was blessed with covenant-keeping brothers and sisters in the gospel who were deeply converted unto the Lord and had learned what it meant to bear each other\u2019s burdens. We are familiar with the verse in Mosiah that speaks of the great faith of Alma\u2019s prayers in behalf of his son. But the record states that \u201cthe Lord \u2026 heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma.\u201d8\nWe know that the Lord always rejoices \u201cin the soul that repenteth,\u201d9 but we desire above all to have our children follow the counsel of President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring to \u201cstart early and be steady\u201d in making and keeping covenants.10 Not long ago a thought-provoking and sincere question was raised in a council of priesthood and auxiliary leaders: do we really expect eight-year-olds to keep their covenants? As we counseled together, it was suggested that one way to prepare children to make and keep sacred baptismal covenants is to help them learn to make and keep a simple promise.\nFaithful parents are entitled to know how to best teach to meet the needs of their children. As parents seek and act on personal revelation, counsel together, minister and teach the simple principles of the gospel, they will have power to strengthen and protect their families. Other family members can also help. My cute grandpa taught us the importance of keeping promises through a simple song. It went something like this: \u201cBefore you make a promise, consider well its importance. Then when made, engrave it upon your heart. Engrave it upon your heart.\u201d That little song was taught with love, conviction, and power because Grandpa engraved his own promises on his heart.\nA wise mother I know intentionally includes her children in her efforts to keep her covenants. She joyfully bears the burdens of neighbors, friends, and ward members\u2014and comforts those who stand in need of comfort. It was not surprising when her young daughter recently came asking for help to know how to best comfort her friend whose father had just passed away. That was a perfect setting to teach that her desire to comfort her friend was one way to keep her baptismal covenant. How can we expect children to make and keep temple covenants if we don\u2019t expect them to keep their first covenant\u2014their baptismal covenant?\nElder Richard\u00a0G. Scott observed, \u201cOne of the greatest blessings we can offer to the world is the power of a Christ-centered home where the gospel is taught, covenants are kept, and love abounds.\u201d11 What are some ways we can create such a home to prepare our children to make and keep temple covenants?\nWe can discover together what it means to be worthy of a temple recommend.\nWe can discover together how to listen to the Holy Ghost. Because the temple endowment is received by revelation, we need to learn that vital skill.\nWe can discover together how to learn through the use of symbols, beginning with the sacred symbols of baptism and the sacrament.\nWe can discover together why the body is sacred, why it is sometimes referred to as a temple, and how modest dress and grooming relates to the sacred nature of temple clothing.\nWe can discover the plan of happiness in the scriptures. The more familiar we are with Heavenly Father\u2019s plan and the Atonement in the scriptures, the more meaningful temple worship will be.\nWe can learn the stories of our ancestors together, research family history, index, and perform vicarious temple work for deceased loved ones.\nWe can discover together the meaning of terms such as endowment, ordinance, sealing, priesthood, keys, and other words related to temple worship.\nWe can teach that we go to the temple to make covenants with Heavenly Father\u2014we return home to keep them!12\nLet us remember the concept of \u201cgood, better, and best\u201d as we teach.13 It is good to teach our children about the temple. It is better to prepare and expect them to make and keep covenants. It is best to show them by example that we cheerfully cleave to our own baptismal and temple covenants! Sisters, do we realize our vital role in the work of salvation as we nurture, teach, and prepare children to progress along the covenant path? The power to do so will come as we honor and keep our covenants.\n2. Keeping covenants is essential for true happiness.\nPresident Thomas\u00a0S. Monson taught, \u201cSacred covenants are to be revered by us, and faithfulness to them is a requirement for happiness.\u201d14 In\u00a02\u00a0Nephi we read, \u201cAnd it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness.\u201d15 Earlier in this same chapter we learn that Nephi and his people had just built a temple. Surely they were joyful covenant keepers! And in Alma we read, \u201cBut behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni.\u201d16 Why? Again we learn in a previous verse that they \u201cwere faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord.\u201d17 Covenant keepers are commandment keepers!\nI love the scripture that reads: \u201cAnd now when the people had heard these words [meaning the words describing the baptismal covenant], they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.\u201d18 I love the desire of their hearts. They cheerfully desired to make and keep their covenants!\nOne Sunday a young sister joyfully exclaimed, \u201cI get to take the sacrament today!\u201d When was the last time we rejoiced in that privilege? And how do we demonstrate it? We do this by always remembering the Savior and always keeping His commandments, which include keeping His Sabbath day holy. We do it by always remembering Him as we always have our personal and family prayers, daily scripture study, and weekly family home evenings. And when we get distracted or casual with these important things, we repent and begin again.\nMaking and cheerfully keeping our covenants gives validity and life to the vital sacred and saving ordinances we need to receive in order to obtain \u201call that [the] Father hath.\u201d19 Ordinances and covenants are the \u201cspiritual milestones\u201d President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring referred to when he taught: \u201cThe Latter-day Saints are a covenant people. From the day of baptism through the spiritual milestones of our lives, we make promises with God and He makes promises with us. He always keeps His promises offered through His authorized servants, but it is the crucial test of our lives to see if we will make and keep our covenants with Him.\u201d20\n3. Keeping our covenants demonstrates our love for the Savior and our Father in Heaven.\nOf all the reasons we ought to be more diligent in our covenant keeping, this reason is more compelling than all\u2014love. A verse in the Old Testament is one that touches my heart as we consider the principle of love. Who of us is not moved by Jacob and Rachel\u2019s biblical love story as we read, \u201cAnd Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her\u201d?21 Sisters, do we keep our covenants with that kind of deep and devoted love?\nWhy was the Savior willing to keep His covenant with the Father and fulfill His divine mission to atone for the sins of the world? It was His love for His Father and His love for us. Why was the Father willing to allow His Only Begotten and perfect Son to suffer pain beyond description to bear the sins, heartaches, sicknesses, and infirmities of the world and all that is unfair in this life? We find the answer in these words: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.\u201d22\n\u201cIf we fully appreciated the many blessings which are ours through the redemption made for us, there is nothing that the Lord could ask of us that we would not anxiously and willingly do.\u201d23 According to this statement by President Joseph Fielding Smith, covenant keeping is one way to express our love for the incomprehensible, infinite Atonement of our Savior and Redeemer and the perfect love of our Father in Heaven.\nElder Holland movingly suggested, \u201cI am not certain just what our experience will be on Judgment Day, but I will be very surprised if at some point in that conversation, God does not ask us exactly what Christ asked Peter: \u2018Did you love me?\u2019\u201d24 Tonight I invite each of us to evaluate how much we love the Savior, using as a measure how joyfully we keep our covenants. The Savior said, \u201cHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\u201d25 How we all need a regular manifestation of the Savior in our daily lives!\nLet us remember that even those who have been wayward in the past or who are currently struggling can feel the touch of the Good Shepherd\u2019s hand upon their heads and hear His voice saying: \u201cCome on. You aren\u2019t tied down anymore. You are free.\u201d The Savior said, \u201cI am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\u201d26 He can say that because He kept His covenants with love. The question then is, will we? May we go forth with faith, cheerful hearts, and a great desire to be covenant keepers. This is how we demonstrate our love for our Father in Heaven and our Savior, both of whom I testify with great love in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy Linda\u00a0K. Burton\nThe Power, Joy, and Love of Covenant Keeping\n2013\nGeneral Relief Society Meeting\n"}, {"text": "In Charles Dickens\u2019s timeless classic A Christmas Carol, Bob Cratchit hoped to spend Christmas Day with his family. \u201c\u2018If quite convenient, Sir,\u2019\u201d he asked his employer, Mr. Scrooge.\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not convenient,\u2019 said Scrooge, \u2018and it\u2019s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you\u2019d think yourself ill used.\u2019 \u2026\n\u201c\u2018And yet,\u2019 said Scrooge, \u2018you don\u2019t think me ill-used, when I pay a day\u2019s wages for no work.\u2019\n\u201cThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\u201c\u2018A poor excuse for picking a man\u2019s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\u2019 said Scrooge.\u201d1\nFor Scrooge\u2014as with any selfish, or \u201cnatural,\u201d man\u2014sacrifice is never convenient.\nThe natural man has a tendency to think only of himself\u2014not only to place himself first, but rarely, if ever, to place anyone else second, including God. For the natural man, sacrifice does not come naturally. He has an insatiable appetite for more. His so-called needs seem to always outpace his income so that having \u201cenough\u201d is forever out of reach, just as it was for the miser Scrooge.\nBecause the natural man tends to hoard or consume everything, the Lord wisely commanded ancient Israel to sacrifice not the last and poorest of the flock, but the firstlings\u2014not the leftovers of the field, but the firstfruits (see Deut. 26:2; Mosiah 2:3; Moses 5:5). Genuine sacrifice has been a hallmark of the faithful from the beginning.\nAmong those who do not sacrifice there are two extremes: one is the rich, gluttonous man who won\u2019t and the other is the poor, destitute man who believes he can\u2019t. But how can you ask someone who is starving to eat less? Is there a level of poverty so low that sacrifice should not be expected or a family so destitute that paying tithing should cease to be required?\nThe Lord often teaches using extreme circumstances to illustrate a principle. The story of the widow of Zarephath is an example of extreme poverty used to teach the doctrine that mercy cannot rob sacrifice any more than it can rob justice. In fact, the truer measure of sacrifice isn\u2019t so much what one gives to sacrifice as what one sacrifices to give (see Mark 12:43). Faith isn\u2019t tested so much when the cupboard is full as when it is bare. In these defining moments, the crisis doesn\u2019t create one\u2019s character\u2014it reveals it. The crisis is the test.\nThe widow of Zarephath lived in the days of the prophet Elijah, by whose word the Lord brought a drought upon the land for three and a half years (see Luke 4:25). The famine grew so severe that many were finally at the point of death. This is the circumstance in which we find the widow.\nThe Lord says to Elijah, \u201cArise, get thee to Zarephath \u2026 : behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:9). It is interesting that Elijah is not told to go to Zarephath until the widow and her son are at the point of death. It is at this extreme moment\u2014facing starvation\u2014that her faith will be tested.\nAs he comes into the city he sees her gathering sticks.\n\u201cAnd he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\n\u201cAnd as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\n\u201cAnd she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:10\u201312).\nA handful of meal would be very little indeed, perhaps just enough for one serving, which makes Elijah\u2019s response intriguing. Listen: \u201cAnd Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:13; emphasis added).\nNow doesn\u2019t that sound selfish, asking not just for the first piece, but possibly the only piece? Didn\u2019t our parents teach us to let other people go first and especially for a gentleman to let a lady go first, let alone a starving widow? Her choice\u2014does she eat, or does she sacrifice her last meal and hasten death? Perhaps she will sacrifice her own food, but could she sacrifice the food meant for her starving son?\nElijah understood the doctrine that blessings come after the trial of our faith (see Ether 12:6; D&C 132:5). He wasn\u2019t being selfish. As the Lord\u2019s servant, Elijah was there to give, not to take. Continuing from the narrative:\n\u201cBut make me thereof a little cake first [the firstlings], and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.\n\u201cFor thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.\n\u201cAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.\n\u201cAnd the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah\u201d (1 Kgs. 17:13\u201316; emphasis added).\nOne reason the Lord illustrates doctrines with the most extreme circumstances is to eliminate excuses. If the Lord expects even the poorest widow to pay her mite, where does that leave all others who find that it is not convenient or easy to sacrifice?\nNo bishop, no missionary should ever hesitate or lack the faith to teach the law of tithing to the poor. The sentiment of \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to\u201d needs to be replaced with \u201cThey can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d\nOne of the first things a bishop must do to help the needy is ask them to pay their tithing. Like the widow, if a destitute family is faced with the decision of paying their tithing or eating, they should pay their tithing. The bishop can help them with their food and other basic needs until they become self-reliant.\nIn October of 1998 Hurricane Mitch devastated many parts of Central America. President Gordon B. Hinckley was very concerned for the victims of this disaster, many of whom lost everything\u2014food, clothing, and household goods. He visited the Saints in the cities of San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and Managua, Nicaragua. And like the words of the loving prophet Elijah to a starving widow, this modern prophet\u2019s message in each city was similar\u2014to sacrifice and be obedient to the law of tithing.\nBut how can you ask someone so destitute to sacrifice? President Hinckley knew that the food and clothing shipments they received would help them survive the crisis, but his concern and love for them went far beyond that. As important as humanitarian aid is, he knew that the most important assistance comes from God, not from man. The prophet wanted to help them unlock the windows of heaven as promised by the Lord in the book of Malachi (see Mal. 3:10; Mosiah 2:24).\nPresident Hinckley taught them that if they would pay their tithing, they would always have food on their tables, they would always have clothing on their backs, and they would always have a roof over their heads.\nWhen serving a meal, it is much easier to set one more plate at the beginning of the meal than it is to find food for a latecomer once the meal is over and the food has been served. Likewise, isn\u2019t it actually easier to give the Lord the firstlings or the firstfruits than it is to hope that there are sufficient \u201cleftovers\u201d for Him? As the founder of our feast, shouldn\u2019t He be the guest of honor, the first to be served?\nMy loving mother, Evelyn Robbins, taught me the law of tithing when I was four years old. She gave me an empty Band-Aid box, the tin kind with a snapping lid. She taught me to keep my tithing pennies in it and then take it to the bishop. I am eternally grateful for her, for that Band-Aid box, and for the blessings that have come from paying tithing.\nIn A Christmas Carol, Mr. Scrooge changed his ways\u2014he was not the man he had been. Likewise, this is the gospel of repentance. If the Spirit is prompting us to more fully obey the law of sacrifice in our life, may we begin making that change today.\nI am so grateful for the Savior, who was the perfect example of obedience through sacrifice\u2014who offered \u201chimself a sacrifice for sin\u201d and became, in Lehi\u2019s words, \u201cthe firstfruits unto God\u201d (2 Ne. 2:7, 9; emphasis added). I bear witness of Him and of these, His doctrines, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nLynn G.

It was there with my parents and brothers and sisters, and a few cousins mixed in, that I learned about family loyalty; love and concern; birth and death; that one must finish a job once it is started; and, to quote my father, \u201cThere are only two things important\u2014the family and the Church.\u201d\nOne year my father was waiting for us as we arrived. He said he had a big job for my brother Clay and me to do that summer. I was about twelve at the time, and my brother was two years older. Pointing to the field by the side of the house, my father said, \u201cDo you see all of these lambs in that field? I\u2019ll share the money we get for the ones you raise when we sell them in the fall.\u201d Well, we were excited. Not only did we have a significant job to do, but we were going to be rich! There were a lot of lambs in that field\u2014about 350 of them. And all we had to do was feed them.\nHowever, there was one thing that my father hadn\u2019t mentioned. None of the lambs had mothers. Just after shearing, there was a violent storm that chilled the newly shorn sheep. Dad lost a thousand ewes that year. The mothers of our lambs were among them.\nTo feed one or two baby animals is one thing, but to feed 350 is something else! It was hard. There was plenty of grass, but the lambs couldn\u2019t eat the grass. They didn\u2019t have teeth. They needed milk. So we made some long, V-shaped feeding troughs out of some boards. Then we got a great big tin washtub, ground up some grain, and added milk to make a thin mash. While my brother poured the mash into the troughs, I rounded up the lambs, herded them to the troughs, and said, \u201cEat!\u201d Well, they just stood there looking at me. Although they were hungry and there was food in front of them, they still wouldn\u2019t eat. No one had taught them to drink milk out of a trough. So I tried pushing them toward the troughs. Do you know what happens when you try to push sheep? They run the other way. And when you lose one, you could lose them all because others will follow. That\u2019s the way with sheep.\nWe tried lining up the lambs along the troughs and pushing their noses down in the milk, hoping they\u2019d get a taste and want some more. We tried wiggling our fingers in the milk to get them to suck on our fingers. Some of them would drink, but most of them ran away.\nMany of the lambs were slowly starving to death. The only way we could be sure they were being fed was to pick them up in our arms, two at a time, and feed them like babies.\nAnd then there were the coyotes. At night the coyotes would sit up on the hill, and they\u2019d howl. The next morning we would see the results of their night\u2019s work, and we would have two or three more lambs to bury. The coyotes would sneak up on the lambs, scatter the herd, and then pick out the ones they wanted and go after them. The first were those that were weak or separated from the flock. Often in the night when the coyotes came and the lambs were restless, my dad would take out his rifle and shoot in the air to scare them away. We felt secure when my dad was home because we knew our lambs were safe when he was there to watch over them.\nClay and I soon forgot about being rich. All we wanted to do was save our lambs. The hardest part was seeing them die. Every morning we would find five, seven, ten lambs that had died during the night. Some the coyotes got, and others starved to death surrounded by food they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t eat.\nPart of our job was to gather up the dead lambs and help dispose of them. I got used to that, and it really wasn\u2019t so bad until I named one of the lambs. It was an awkward little thing with a black spot on its nose. It was always under my feet, and it knew my voice. I loved my lamb. It was one I held in my arms and fed with a bottle like a baby.\nOne morning my lamb didn\u2019t come when I called. I found it later that day under the willows by the creek. It was dead. With tears streaming down my face, I picked up my lamb and went to find my father. Looking up at him, I said, \u201cDad, isn\u2019t there someone who can help us feed our lambs?\u201d\nAfter a long moment he said, \u201cJayne, once a long, long time ago, someone else said almost those same words. He said, \u2018Feed my lambs. \u2026 Feed my sheep. \u2026 Feed my sheep.\u2019\u201d (John 21:15\u201317.) Dad put his arms around me and let me cry for a time, then went with me to bury my lamb.\nIt wasn\u2019t until many years later that I fully realized the meaning of my father\u2019s words. I was pondering the scripture in Moses that says, \u201cFor behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of [all mankind].\u201d (Moses 1:39.) As I thought about the mission of the Savior, I remembered the summer of the lambs, and, for a few brief moments, I thought I could sense how the Savior must feel with so many lambs to feed, so many souls to save. And I knew in my heart that he needed my help.\nYou wonderful young people, from what we\u2019ve observed, you\u2019re not unlike our lambs. You, too, are hungry\u2014hungry for things of the Spirit that will make you grow strong and keep you safe from the coyotes that are out to destroy you. You are capable and willing to do your part in building the kingdom when you are taught how. And we want to help you.\nWe know that you need someone to love you, someone to listen and understand. You need to be needed. You need opportunities to come together in a safe environment, a safe fold so to speak, where you can share with one another and develop wholesome friendships based on brother-sister relationships rather than romantic involvement. You need opportunities to experience the joy of sacrifice and service, of caring for and loving one another as our Savior loves us. Within the gospel we have what you need, but you will need to reach out and accept it.\nIt would have been far easier to save our lambs if the mothers had been there to feed them. Young women, you are the mothers of tomorrow. Young men, you are the fathers. Together, you are the parents, the teachers, and the advisers who will help nurture and feed young lambs and lead them home. Prepare yourselves now for that sacred responsibility. Study the scriptures. Develop your God-given talents. Learn all you can about the world around you that is clean and good. Prepare yourselves to enter the temple of the Lord and be worthy to receive the ordinances and blessings by living, teaching, and sharing the gospel.\nYour Heavenly Father knows you and cares about what you are doing. He wants you to fulfill your divine mission, then come home and bring your family and friends with you. He wants you to be happy. Be on your knees daily and talk to your Heavenly Father. Share the happy times. Talk about what\u2019s hard for you. Like my father, your Heavenly Father will understand. He\u2019ll be there to walk with you, and to comfort and protect you, for he has promised to those who seek him, \u201cI will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.\u201d (D&C 84:88.)\nOur prophet, President Benson, has said, \u201cThe symbolism of the Good Shepherd is not without significant parallel in the Church today.\u201d The sheep need to be led by watchful shepherds. \u201cWith a shepherd\u2019s loving care, our young people, our young lambs, will not be as inclined to wander. And if they do, the crook of the shepherd\u2019s staff, a loving arm, and an understanding heart will help to retrieve them.\u201d (Regional Representatives\u2019 Seminar, 3 Apr. 1987.)\nParents, priesthood leaders, teachers, advisers, be \u201cwatchful shepherds\u201d; and you, our noble youth, band together in the strength of the Lord and lead out in righteousness. Reach out with loving arms and understanding hearts to those who are weak or wandering. Help bring them back to the fold, where they can learn of the Good Shepherd and grow close to him. And please choose carefully the paths you walk, for others will follow. That\u2019s the way with sheep.\nOf our little flock, we saved only one-third. And what of the Savior\u2019s flock? He has said, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u2026 Feed my sheep.\u201d\nThis I know: He needs our help. With more people to help, more lambs will be saved. A simple fact, but true. Of this I can bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nJayne B. Malan\nThe Summer of the Lambs\n1989\nSunday Afternoon Session\n"}, {"text": "I am grateful to be gathered with the priesthood of God, which stretches across the world. I appreciate your faith, your service, and your prayers.\nMy message tonight is about the Aaronic Priesthood. It is also to all of us who help in the realization of the Lord\u2019s promises for those who hold what is described in scripture as the \u201clesser priesthood.\u201d1 It is also called the preparatory priesthood. It is that glorious preparation about which I will speak tonight.\nThe Lord\u2019s plan for His work is filled with preparation. He prepared the earth for us to experience the tests and the opportunities of mortality. While we are here, we are in what the scriptures call a \u201cpreparatory state.\u201d2\nThe prophet Alma described the crucial importance of that preparation for eternal life, where we may live forever in families with God the Father and Jesus Christ.\nHe explained the need for preparation this way: \u201cAnd we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.\u201d3\nJust as the time we have been given to live in mortality is to prepare to meet God, the time we are given to serve in the Aaronic Priesthood is an opportunity to prepare us to learn how to give crucial help to others. Just as the Lord gives the help we require to pass the tests of mortal life, He also sends us help in our priesthood preparation.\nMy message is to those whom the Lord sends to help prepare Aaronic Priesthood holders as much as it is to those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood. I speak to fathers. I speak to bishops. And I speak to those of the Melchizedek Priesthood who are trusted to be companions and teachers of young men who are in priesthood preparation.\nI speak in praise and in gratitude for many of you across the world and across time.\nI would be remiss if I did not speak of a branch president and a bishop of my youth. I became a deacon at the age of 12 in a little branch in the eastern part of the United States. The branch was so tiny that my older brother and I were its only Aaronic Priesthood holders until my father, who was the branch president, invited a middle-aged man to join the Church.\nThe new convert received the Aaronic Priesthood and, with it, a call to watch over the Aaronic Priesthood. I still remember as if it were yesterday. I can recall the beautiful fall leaves as that new convert accompanied my brother and me to do something for a widow. I don\u2019t remember what the project was, but I do remember feeling that the priesthood power joined in doing what I later learned the Lord had said we must all do to have our sins forgiven and so be prepared to see Him.\nAs I look back now, I feel gratitude for a branch president who called a new convert to help the Lord prepare two boys who would in turn someday be bishops, charged to care for the poor and the needy and also to preside over the preparatory priesthood.\nI was still a deacon when our family moved to a large ward in Utah. It was the first time I had felt the power of a full quorum in the Aaronic Priesthood. In fact, it was the first time I saw one. And later it was the first time I felt the power and the blessing of a bishop presiding in a priests quorum.\nThe bishop called me to be his first assistant in the priests quorum. I remember that he taught the quorum himself\u2014busy as he was, with other gifted men whom he could have called to teach us. He had the chairs in the classroom arranged in a circle. He had me sit in the chair next to him, to his right.\nI could look over his shoulder as he taught. He looked down occasionally at the carefully typed notes in the little leather binder on one knee and at the well-worn and marked scriptures he had open on the other knee. I can remember the thrill as he recounted the stories of bravery from the book of Daniel and his testimony of the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nI will always remember how the Lord calls companions carefully chosen for his priesthood holders in preparation.\nMy bishop had powerful counselors, and for reasons I did not understand then, more than once he called me on the phone at home and said, \u201cHal, I need you to go with me as a companion to make some visits.\u201d Once, it was to take me with him to the home of a widow living alone and without any food in the house. On the way home he stopped his car, opened his scriptures, and told me why he had treated that widow as if she had the power not only to care for herself but would, at some time in the future, be able to help others.\nAnother visit was to a man long absent from the Church. My bishop invited him back to be with the Saints. I felt my bishop\u2019s love for someone who seemed to me an unlovable and rebellious enemy.\nOn yet another occasion we visited a home where two little girls were sent to meet us at the door by their alcoholic parents. The little girls said through the screen door that their mother and father were asleep. The bishop kept talking to them, smiling and praising their goodness and their bravery, for what seemed to me 10 minutes or more. As I walked away at his side, he said quietly, \u201cThat was a good visit. Those little girls will never forget that we came.\u201d\nTwo of the blessings that a senior priesthood companion can give are trust and an example of caring. I saw that when my son was given a home teaching companion who had vastly more priesthood experience than he did. His senior companion had been a mission president twice and had served in other leadership positions.\nBefore they were to visit one of their assigned families, that seasoned priesthood leader asked to visit my son in our home beforehand. They allowed me to listen. The senior companion opened with prayer, asking for help. Then he said something like this to my son: \u201cI think we should teach a lesson that will sound to this family like a call to repentance. I think they won\u2019t take it very well from me. I think they would take the message better from you. How do you feel about that?\u201d\nI remember the terror in my son\u2019s eyes. I can still feel the happiness of that moment when my son accepted the trust.\nIt was not by accident that the bishop put that companionship together. It was by careful preparation that the senior companion had learned about the feelings of that family they were about to teach. It was by inspiration that he felt to step back, to trust an inexperienced youth to call older children of God to repentance and to safety.\nI don\u2019t know the outcome of their visit, but I do know that a bishop, a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, and the Lord were preparing a boy to be a priesthood man and someday a bishop.\nNow, such stories of success in priesthood preparation are familiar to you from what you have seen and what you have experienced in your own lives. You have known and have been such bishops, companions, and parents. You have seen the hand of the Lord in your preparation for the priesthood duties which He knew would lie ahead of you.\nAll of us in the priesthood have an obligation to help the Lord prepare others. There are some things we can do that could matter most. Even more powerful than using words in our teaching the doctrine will be our examples of living the doctrine.\nParamount in our priesthood service is inviting people to come unto Christ by faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson, for instance, has given sermons to stir the heart on all those doctrines. But what I know of what he did with people and missionaries and friends of the Church when presiding over the mission in Toronto motivates me to action.\nIn priesthood preparation, \u201cshow me\u201d counts more than \u201ctell me.\u201d\nThat is why the scriptures are so important to prepare us in the priesthood. They are filled with examples. I feel as if I can see Alma following the angel\u2019s command and then hurrying back to teach the wicked people in Ammonihah who had rejected him.4 I can feel the cold in the jail cell when the Prophet Joseph was told by God to take courage and that he was watched over.5 With those scripture pictures in mind, we can be prepared to endure in our service when it seems hard.\nA father or a bishop or a senior home teaching companion who shows that he trusts a young priesthood holder can change his life. My father was once asked by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to write a short paper on science and religion. My father was a famous scientist and a faithful priesthood holder. But I can still remember the moment he handed me the paper he had written and said, \u201cHere, before I send this to the Twelve, I want you to read it. You will know if it is right.\u201d He was 32 years older than me and immeasurably more wise and intelligent.\nI still am strengthened by that trust from a great father and priesthood man. I knew that his trust was not in me but that God could and would tell me what was true. You seasoned companions can bless a young priesthood holder in preparation whenever you can show him that kind of trust. It will help him trust the gentle feeling of inspiration for himself when it comes as he someday places his hands to seal the blessing to heal a child the doctors say will die. That trust has helped me more than once.\nOur success in preparing others in the priesthood will come in proportion to how much we love them. That will be especially true when we must correct them. Think of the moment when an Aaronic Priesthood holder, perhaps at the sacrament table, makes a mistake in performing an ordinance. That is a serious matter. Sometimes the error requires public correction with a possibility of resentment, a feeling of humiliation or even of being rejected.\nYou will remember the Lord\u2019s counsel: \u201cReproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy.\u201d6\nThe word increase has special meaning in preparing priesthood holders when they need correction. The word suggests an increase of a love that was already there. The \u201cshowing forth\u201d is about the increase. Those of you who are preparing priesthood holders will certainly see them make mistakes. Before they receive your correction, they must have felt of your love early and steadily. They must have felt your genuine praise before they will accept your correction.\nThe Lord Himself held those of the lesser priesthood with a regard that honors their potential and their value to Him. Listen to these words, spoken by John the Baptist when the Aaronic Priesthood was restored: \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.\u201d7\nThe Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage to the greater Melchizedek Priesthood.8 As the president of all the priesthood, the President of the Church presides over the preparatory priesthood as well. His messages over the years of going to the rescue fit perfectly the mandate to take the gospel of repentance and baptism into the lives of others.\nQuorums of deacons, teachers, and priests counsel regularly to draw every member of the quorum to the Lord. Presidencies assign members to reach out in faith and love. Deacons pass the sacrament with reverence and with faith that members will feel the effect of the Atonement and resolve to keep commandments as they partake of those sacred emblems.\nTeachers and priests pray with their companions to fulfill the charge to watch over the Church, person by person. And those companionships pray together as they learn the needs and the hopes of heads of families. As they do, they are being prepared for the great day when they will preside as a father, in faith, in a family of their own.\nI testify that all who serve together in the priesthood are preparing a people for the coming of the Lord to His Church. God the Father lives. I know\u2014I know\u2014that Jesus is the Christ and that He loves us. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson is the Lord\u2019s living prophet. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\nBy President Henry\u00a0B. Eyring\nThe Preparatory Priesthood\n2014\nPriesthood Session\n"}, {"text": "One hundred and fifty years ago this week, the Lord revealed to His prophet Joseph Smith sublime doctrine concerning the sacred ordinance of baptism. That light came when other Christian churches taught that death irrevocably, eternally, determined the destiny of the soul. The baptized were rewarded with endless joy. All others faced eternal torment, without hope of redemption. The Lord\u2019s revelation that baptism could be performed vicariously for the dead, through proper priesthood authority, preserved the justice of His statement: \u201cExcept a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (John 3:5.)\nVicarious baptism also mercifully provides this ordinance for all worthy deceased who have not received it through proper priesthood authority.\nThis glorious doctrine is another witness of the all-encompassing nature of the atonement of Jesus Christ. He has made salvation available to every repentant soul. His was a vicarious atonement that conquered death. He permits the worthy deceased to receive all ordinances of salvation vicariously.\nIn that epistle, written one hundred and fifty years ago, Joseph Smith stated: \u201cThe Saints have the privilege of being baptized for \u2026 their relatives who are dead \u2026 who have received the Gospel in the spirit \u2026 through \u2026 those who have been commissioned to preach to them. \u2026 Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation.\u201d (History of the Church, 4:231; italics added.)\nThe prophet Elijah committed the keys for vicarious work to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple (see D&C 110:13\u201316) to fulfill the Lord\u2019s promise that \u201che shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.\u201d (D&C 2:2.)\nThrough further revelation to Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, there has come an understanding of and provision for temple work and the family history effort that supports it. Every prophet since Joseph Smith has emphasized the imperative need to provide all ordinances for ourselves and our deceased ancestors.\nThis inspired counsel can be simply summarized:\nWe are to:\nTurn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to their fathers.\nInsure that ordinances are performed for ourselves and our ancestors.\nSeal individuals into eternal family relationships.\nMany members of the Church recognize the vital importance of these commandments but feel overwhelmed at the task of identifying their own ancestors. To overcome this feeling, the Church has greatly simplified finding our ancestors and clearing their names for temple work. For example, with the generous cooperation of the original record holders, we have gathered information on approximately two billion of the estimated seven billion individuals for whom records are thought to exist. That resource increases by many millions of names each year.\nAlso, fifteen hundred family history centers operate worldwide to permit access to our vast record resources. You will find them staffed with sensitive, understanding volunteers who want to help. Through research guides, telefax, and correspondence, these centers are fortified by the impressive capabilities of the Salt Lake City Family History Library.\nModern technology has greatly simplified the prior complex rules and regulations for this work. These streamlined steps are clearly explained in the pamphlet Come unto Christ through Temple Ordinances and Covenants. It is available in the principal languages from priesthood leaders throughout the world. This booklet provides a summary of the doctrinal basis for family history and temple service.\nAlso, where they have been called, ward or branch family history consultants are available to help you succeed.\nMany brilliant minds and sensitive hearts have harnessed advanced technology to provide personal computer helps to simplify family history work. Under the descriptive title of FamilySearch,\u2122 these powerful computer-aided resources are now available in family history centers in the United States and Canada. (Request them if they are not there. They are within policy.) In due course, these resources will be made available elsewhere in the world.\nFamilySearch provides members easy access to the Church\u2019s central genealogy computer files. It greatly simplifies research and enables members to more efficiently find information in the Church\u2019s vast storehouse of microfilmed records. The computer provides direct, rapid search of a large compilation of valuable information on compact discs without time or error of searching traditional microfilm or microfiche. FamilySearch provides these five specific types of helps that are as easy to use as a telephone:\nAncestral File\u2122 is a computer resource of seven million names linked into family relationships. This resource is the heart of our effort to collect the genealogy of mankind and make that information readily available to others, to simplify their family history research, and permanently preserve family relationships.\nAncestral File comprises the \u201cfour generation\u201d submittals from members and friends. These data have been carefully matched and coupled one with another, providing a powerfully rich source of family-linked information that simplifies research and reduces duplication. It contains names and addresses, enabling coordination of research with other submitters. Means now exist that permit you or family organizations to enter all of your family-linked information for permanent preservation and use by others.\nRecently a friend of the Church, tenderly holding a five-inch-high stack of information, said with obvious gratitude: \u201cThe Church placed my life\u2019s work in a computer where it will be permanently recorded and available for others to use.\u201d That spirit is spreading throughout the world where friends who wish to show their gratitude for using Church resources, are now generously donating their laboriously compiled family history information to share with others.\nAnother help is the Family History Library Catalog.\u2122 It contains the description of virtually every family history record of the Church, permitting a rapid, automatic, precise name or locality search of the detailed catalog descriptions.\nThe automated International Genealogical Index\u2122 replaces 10,000 microfiche, providing computer research of data on 147 million deceased individuals and allowing limited linking of family members.\nShortly, an automated 39-million-name U.S. Social Security Death Register\u2122 will be distributed.\nWithin two or three years, other organized data will be readily available on hundreds of millions of deceased individuals. (For data privacy reasons, we do not provide computerized data on living persons.)\nFor example, a large group of members is organizing the 50-million-name 1880 U.S. Census. Five thousand nonmembers and seventy-seven missionaries are organizing the 27-million-name English 1881 Census. A 5-million-name record of Australian births, marriages, and deaths from 1788 to 1888 is near completion. These helps will permit automatic nationwide search for an ancestor without specifying locality.\nYet another help, the Personal Ancestral File\u2122 is a powerful, inexpensive, easy-to-use resource available for home use that helps organize, analyze, and print your family history. It reports what ordinance work is lacking and allows electronic sharing of data.\nBut for me, the most thrilling resource will eliminate the delay in clearing names for temple work. Beginning next fall, you will be able to clear ancestors\u2019 names for temple ordinances in your own meetinghouse yourself, without the need to request headquarters approval. When you verify that no previous ordinance has been performed, you can go immediately to the temple to perform these ordinances.\nYes, the Lord is accelerating His work.\nIt was hard to get excited about genealogy work, with its many rules and regulations about commas, periods, and capitalization. The new family history service is quite another matter. It deals with loving, caring, feeling ancestors beyond the veil.\nNow, Richard Talbot, John Dunkerson, and Abraham Salee are not just names on a slip of paper for me to receive their temple ordinances. These are ancestors I love through temple work. They, in turn, have influenced my life. I find traits displayed in their purposeful lives woven into the fabric of my own character. Begin this work, and you will know why the Lord said, \u201cThe hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.\u201d (D&C 2:2.) Learn why this glorious doctrine has been restored to the earth.\nOnce I listened as a humble sister, blind except for a small window of vision in one eye, bore witness of deeply spiritual experiences she enjoyed with her husband identifying individuals for temple work. She explained that internal bleeding had recently taken the last vestige of sight. Her testimony was sweet, her prayer that she might see enough to serve. Miraculously she was given even greater sight.\nOne choice source on my ancestors was prepared by a remarkable woman in 1888. She labored without any doctrinal understanding or the abundant resources we have. Following impressions of the heart, her persistence and extensive correspondence produced a 16,000 lineage-linked treasury of information about our Talbot family. My mother obtained this record. A descendant, Cathy Frost, with two preschool children and expecting another, is computerizing those names. My wife, Jeanene, and I will personally clear them for temple work using the simplified helps I\u2019ve described today. Our family will go to the temple for these ancestors.\nAt present you may find it difficult to go to the temple personally, but you can submit ancestors\u2019 names for temple work. You may live where resources are very limited. Begin with ancestors that are closest to you. Search beyond your surname, following all lines of ancestry. Following the simple guidelines, prepare requests for temple work. Resolve to bless the lives of those who are dependent upon you\u2014and in so doing, bless your own life profoundly.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you the details of where to go and who to see. When you determine you are going to succeed, you will find a way. You will discover those who can help you. I promise you the Lord will bless you in your efforts, for this is His work, and He will guide your prayerful efforts to bring the ordinances and covenants to your ancestors.\nI have tasted enough of the fruits of this sublime work to know that the keys Elijah restored to Joseph Smith permit our hearts to be bound and each of us linked to those of our ancestors who are waiting for our help. Through our efforts in holy temples here on earth using the authority delegated by the Savior, our progenitors receive the saving ordinances that allow them to enjoy eternal happiness.\nIn the past, motivated by a deep conviction of the sanctity of the work, individuals have valiantly faced a challenge that seemed like singlehandedly endeavoring to harvest all the grain in Nebraska. Now, many mighty combines are at work. Together we will accomplish the work.\nHow fitting that for the 150th anniversary of the declaration by Joseph Smith of vicarious work for the dead, the Brethren have announced greatly simplified means to identify ancestors and permit temple ordinances to be performed for them.\nI testify that the spirit of Elijah is touching the hearts of many of Father\u2019s children throughout the world, causing the work for the dead to accelerate at an unprecedented pace.\nBut what about you? Have you prayed about your own ancestors\u2019 work? Set aside those things that don\u2019t really matter in your life. Decide to do something that will have eternal consequences. Perhaps you have been prompted to look for ancestors but feel that you are not a genealogist. Can you see that you don\u2019t have to be anymore? It all begins with love and a sincere desire to help those who can\u2019t help themselves.\nThis is a spiritual work, a monumental effort of cooperation on both sides of the veil where help is given in both directions. It begins with love. Anywhere you are in the world, with prayer, faith, determination, diligence, and some sacrifice, you can make a powerful contribution. Begin now.

For example, they may have pondered ways Joshua\u2019s mission reminds them of Jesus Christ\u2019s. Why are we grateful for the stories in the book of Joshua?\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine\n\n\n\nJoshua 1:1\u20139\n\u201cBe strong and of a good courage.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoshua was told, \u201cBe strong and of a good courage\u201d several times (see Deuteronomy 31:7,\u00a023; Joshua 1:6\u20137,\u00a09). Perhaps class members would benefit from discussing what the Lord means by this phrase. They could search Joshua 1:1\u20139 for counsel the Lord gave Joshua to help him be strong and courageous. They could also share examples of people they know of who have these traits. How did Joshua show strength and courage in the accounts found in the book of Joshua? (for example, see chapters 3, 6, and\u00a08). Class members could share how they are trying to be strong and courageous for Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua 1:8\nThe word of God can make our way prosperous.\n\n\n\nTo encourage class members in their personal and family scripture study, you could read Joshua 1:8 as a class. What do we learn from this verse about how to study the scriptures? Perhaps class members could share what they are doing to \u201cmeditate\u201d in the scriptures \u201cday and night.\u201d How has the Lord made our \u201cway prosperous\u201d and given us \u201cgood success\u201d as we studied His word?\n\n  ImageAfrica: People in Ghana\n\nThe word of God can \u201cmake [our] way prosperous\u201d (Joshua 1:8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua 3\u20134\nWe can experience God\u2019s \u201cwonders.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps class members would benefit from a brief review of the account of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River. You could divide the class into pairs and invite each pair to tell the story to each other, taking turns saying one sentence at a time (encourage them to look in Joshua\u00a03 if they need help remembering the story). Then, as a class, they could discuss any details that stood out to them. What do we learn from this story that can help us experience the \u201cwonders\u201d of the Lord in our lives? (verse\u00a05). What \u201cwonders\u201d has He done for us? Why is it important that each generation have spiritual experiences that teach them that \u201cthe Lord \u2026 is mighty\u201d? (Joshua 4:24).\n\n\nEven though we all need to have our own faith-building experiences, remembering what the Lord has done for our ancestors is also important. According to Joshua\u00a04, what did the Israelites do to help future generations remember the crossing of the Jordan River? (see Joshua 4:1\u20137). What are we doing to ensure that our experiences are not forgotten by future generations?\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua 6\u20138\nObedience brings God\u2019s power into my life.\n\n\n\nThis week\u2019s outline in Come, Follow Me\u2014For Individuals and Families suggests comparing the Israelites\u2019 battles against the Canaanites in Joshua 6\u20138 with our personal battles against temptation. You might ask class members what thoughts or impressions they had as they read these chapters with this comparison in mind. Or you could point them to specific verses that seem relevant to our battles to avoid sin, and they could talk about what those verses teach about gaining access to God\u2019s power in our lives. Some of these verses might include Joshua 6:1\u20135, 18,\u00a020; 7:11\u201313.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua 23\u201324\n\u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps it would help class members apply Joshua 23\u201324 to themselves if they imagined that they were Israelites hearing Joshua give this counsel at the end of his life. You might give them a few verses to read silently and then ask them to share something from those verses that would have inspired them to stay faithful to the Lord. They could also share how they have personally made the decision about \u201cwhom [they] will serve\u201d (Joshua 24:15). Why did they make this decision?\n\n\nYou could invite class members to pick a phrase from Joshua 23\u201324 that inspires them to choose to serve God and then create a poster or meme with this phrase to display at home or on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nSpiritual growth happens at home. Members of your class need to have their own spiritual experiences outside of class in order to stay spiritually strong. Find ways to use the brief time you have with them to inspire them to find spiritual nourishment in the scriptures at home\u2014individually and with their families. (See Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way,\u00a018.)\n\n"}, {"text": "\nRecord Your ImpressionsCreate a Note\nWhat could have inspired Peter to leave the safety of his boat in the middle of the Sea of Galilee during a boisterous storm? What led him to believe that if Jesus could walk on water, he could too? We can\u2019t know for certain, but perhaps Peter understood that the Son of God came not just to do wonderful things for the people but to empower people like Peter to do wonderful things too. Jesus\u2019s invitation, after all, was \u201cCome, follow me\u201d (Luke 18:22). Peter had accepted this invitation once, and he was willing to accept it again, even if it meant facing his fears and doing something that seemed impossible. Perhaps the Lord will not ask us to step out of a boat in the middle of a storm or contribute our meager supply of bread when thousands need to eat, but He may ask us to accept directions even when we don\u2019t fully understand them. Whatever His invitations to us may be, they may sometimes seem surprising or even frightening.

What do you learn from the words and actions of Peter? (See also 1\u00a0Nephi 3:7.) What is the Lord inviting you to do that might be like stepping out of the boat?

You may have been invited to ponder how you give praise to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and to consider ways you could improve your personal worship.\n\n\nWhat have you recently learned or felt about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ that has motivated you to want to worship Them?\n\n\nWhat efforts have you made to improve your worship? For example, you may have sought to deepen your worship through prayer, scripture study, partaking of the sacrament, honoring the Sabbath day, fasting, attending the temple, or some other way.\n\n\nHow have these efforts affected your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity B: Resist and overcome evil with faith in Christ\n\nIn Revelation 12\u201313, you may have learned that in the premortal life we all exercised our faith in Jesus Christ to overcome Satan. You may have been invited to ponder your belief in these teachings and think of what you could do to continue placing your trust in Jesus Christ as we battle the adversary here in mortality.\n\n\nWhat actions did you feel you should take after your study?\n\n\nWhat barriers or challenges did you encounter in taking those actions?

Emma Smith witnessed the opposition firsthand. In June\u00a01830, Emma and members of the Knight family wished to be baptized. But enemies of the Church tried to disrupt what should have been a sacred experience. First they destroyed the dam that had been built to provide deep enough water for the baptisms. Even after the dam was repaired, the persecutors gathered to shout threats and mock those being baptized. Then, just as Joseph was about to confirm the new members, he was arrested for upsetting the community by preaching about the Book of Mormon. It seemed like an unpromising start for the Lord\u2019s newly restored Church. But in the midst of this uncertainty and upheaval, the Lord provided precious words of counsel and encouragement, which represent His \u201cvoice unto all\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants 25:16).\nSee also Saints, 1:89\u201390, 94\u201397.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 23\u201326\nI can help strengthen the Lord\u2019s Church.\n\nToday, almost 200 years after the restored Church was organized, the need \u201cto strengthen the church\u201d continues (Doctrine and Covenants 23:3\u20135).

One way to get to know this \u201celect lady\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants 25:3) is to read the words of people who knew her personally.\n\n  ImageEmma Hale Smith\n\nEmma Smith, by Lee Greene Richards\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith\u00a0Jr., her husband\n\n  ImageJoseph Smith The Prophet\n\u201cWith what unspeakable delight, and what transports of joy swelled my bosom, when I took by the hand, on that night, my beloved Emma\u2014she that was my wife, even the wife of my youth; and the choice of my heart. Many were the re-vibrations of my mind when I contemplated for a moment the many scenes we had been called to pass through. The fatigues, and the toils, the sorrows, and sufferings, and the joys and consolations from time to time had strewed our paths and crowned our board. Oh! what a co-mingling of thought filled my mind for the moment, Again she is here, even in the seventh trouble, undaunted, firm, and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.\u201d1\n\n\n\nLucy Mack Smith, her mother-in-law\n\n  ImageLucy Mack Smith\n\u201cShe was then young, and, being naturally ambitious, her whole heart was in the work of the Lord, and she felt no interest except for the church and the cause of truth. Whatever her hands found to do, she did with her might and did not ask the selfish question \u2018Shall I be benefited any more than anyone else?\u2019 If elders were sent away to preach, she was the first to volunteer her services to assist in clothing them for their journey, let her own privations be what they might.\u201d2\n\u201cI have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with that unflinching courage, zeal and patience, which she has always done; for I know that which she has had to endure; that she has been tossed upon the ocean of uncertainty; that she has breasted the storm of persecution, and buffeted the rage of men and devils, until she has been swallowed up in a sea of trouble which [would] have borne down almost any other woman.\u201d3\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith\u00a0Sr., her father-in-law\n\nEmma\u2019s patriarchal blessing, pronounced by Joseph Smith\u00a0Sr., who was serving as patriarch of the Church:\n\u201cEmma, my daughter-in-law, thou art blessed of the Lord, for thy faithfulness and truth: thou shalt be blessed with thy husband, and rejoice in the glory which shall come upon him: Thy soul has been afflicted because of the wickedness of men in seeking the destruction of thy companion, and thy whole soul has been drawn out in prayer for his deliverance: rejoice, for the Lord thy God has heard thy supplication.\n\u201cThou hast grieved for the hardness of the hearts of thy father\u2019s house, and thou hast longed for their salvation. The Lord will have respect to thy cries, and by his judgments he will cause some of them to see their folly and repent of their sins; but it will be by affliction that they will be saved. Thou shall see many days; yea, the Lord will spare thee till thou art satisfied, for thou shalt see thy Redeemer. Thy heart shall rejoice in the great work of the Lord, and no one shall take thy rejoicing from thee.\n\u201cThou shalt ever remember the great condescension of thy God in permitting thee to accompany my son when the angel delivered the record of the Nephites to his care. Thou hast seen much sorrow because the Lord has taken from thee three of thy children: in this thou are not to be blamed, for he knows thy pure desires to raise up a family, that the name of my son might be blessed. And now, behold, I say unto thee, that thus says the Lord, if thou wilt believe, thou shalt yet be blessed in this thing and thou shalt bring forth other children, to the joy and satisfaction of thy soul, and to the rejoicing of thy friends.\n\u201cThou shalt be blessed with understanding, and have power to instruct thy sex. Teach thy family righteousness, and thy little ones the way of life, and the holy angels shall watch over thee: and thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God; even so.

Nelson has said (\u201cDecisions for Eternity,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 108). Similarly, the Apostle Paul explained that when we are baptized, we \u201cwalk in newness of life\u201d (Romans 6:4). Because of Jesus Christ, every day\u2014not just the day we are baptized\u2014can bring \u201cnewness of life\u201d or a chance to walk farther from sin and closer to God. To live the gospel of Jesus Christ means to repent and grow closer to God\u2014constantly, sometimes gradually\u2014knowing that our efforts will lead us to a fulness of joy.\nPonder how the Savior is changing you and the people you teach. How can you more completely receive the Savior\u2019s power to change you? Think about this as you read Romans 1\u20136 and as you prepare to teach. You might also review President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson\u2019s message \u201cWe Can Do Better and Be Better\u201d (Ensign or Liahona, May 2019, 67\u201369) or Sister Becky Craven\u2019s message \u201cKeep the Change\u201d (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2020, 58\u201360).\n\n\n\nLearn Together\n\nFor some of us, the \u201cnewness of life\u201d that Christ offers (Romans 6:4) is hard to discern because it happens gradually, while for others, this change happens more quickly. You might invite class or quorum members to share what \u201cwalk in newness of life\u201d means to them. What are some words and phrases from Romans\u00a06 that describe our lives with and without the Savior\u2019s influence? (If the youth need help, they could look in verses\u00a06, 11, 22\u201323.) What other words and phrases can we think of? How does the Savior offer to help us change? Activities like the following can lead to a deeper discussion on this topic.\n\n\nTo help the class or quorum think about changes the Savior could help them make, invite them to read the definition under \u201cRepent, Repentance\u201d in Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). They could also discuss President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson\u2019s definition of repentance in the first seven paragraphs of his message \u201cWe Can Do Better and Be Better.\u201d What important truths do we learn about repentance from these definitions? You might also give the class or quorum time to ponder President Nelson\u2019s list of things Jesus asks us to change (in the fifth paragraph of his message). Encourage them to write down something specific they feel prompted to change. Bear your testimony about the Savior\u2019s power to help us repent and change.\n\n\nSister Becky Craven said that friends from her past sometimes say, \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all!\u201d You might share Sister Craven\u2019s comments about this (see \u201cKeep the Change,\u201d 59\u201360). Ask class or quorum members to imagine that in five or ten years, they run into a friend from their past. What changes might be obvious to our friends? In what ways do we hope we will have changed? How can faith in Jesus Christ help us to change? (see Mosiah 5:2\u20135, 7; Alma 5:11\u201313; Ether 12:27, or the \u201ccontinuous pattern for change\u201d Sister Craven described in the four paragraphs of her message beginning with \u201cWhen I was younger\u201d). You might ask the youth to share any experiences when Jesus Christ helped them change.\n\n\nSometimes we may think that we are expected to make changes or improvements in our lives all on our own. How is this different from true repentance? To help your class or quorum discuss this question, you could review together the statements in \u201cSupporting Resources.\u201d What can we do now to seek the Savior\u2019s help and power so that our changes will be permanent and joyful? This could be a good opportunity for the youth to consider their personal development goals. How can we include the Savior in our goals?\n\n\n\n  ImageWorship\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ helps us to repent and become more like Him each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAct in Faith\n\nEncourage class or quorum members to ponder and record what they will do to act on the impressions they received today. If they would like, they could share their ideas. Invite them to think about how acting on their impressions will strengthen their relationships with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nSupporting Resources\n\n\n\nPresident Russell\u00a0M. Nelson explained: \u201cWe can change our behavior. Our very desires can change. How? There is only one way. True change\u2014permanent change\u2014can come only through the healing, cleansing, and enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He loves you\u2014each of you! He allows you to access His power as you keep His commandments, eagerly, earnestly, and exactly\u201d (\u201cDecisions for Eternity,\u201d\u00a0108).\n\n\nElder Dale\u00a0G. Renlund taught: \u201cThe power that makes repentance possible [is] the atoning sacrifice of our Savior. Real repentance must involve faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, faith that He can change us, faith that He can forgive us, and faith that He will help us avoid more mistakes. This kind of faith makes His Atonement effective in our lives. When we \u2026 \u2018turn around\u2019 [repent] with the Savior\u2019s help, we can feel hope in His promises and the joy of forgiveness. Without the Redeemer, the inherent hope and joy evaporate, and repentance becomes simply miserable behavior modification. But by exercising faith in Him, we become converted to His ability and willingness to forgive sin\u201d (Dale\u00a0G. Renlund, \u201cRepentance: A Joyful Choice,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016,\u00a0122).\n\n\n\n\nTeaching in the Savior\u2019s Way\n\nThe activities in this outline suggest possible ways to help your class or quorum learn together about the Savior and His power to help us change. There may be other approaches that will work better for those you teach. Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Spirit as you plan ways to build faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\nRecord Your ImpressionsCreate a Note\nWhen Alma saw wickedness around him, he felt deep \u201csorrow,\u201d \u201ctribulation,\u201d and \u201canguish of soul\u201d (Alma 8:14). \u201cWickedness among this people,\u201d he said of the Zoramites, \u201cdoth pain my soul\u201d (Alma 31:30). He felt something similar after returning from his mission to the Zoramites\u2014he observed that \u201cthe hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word,\u201d and this made his heart \u201cexceedingly sorrowful\u201d (Alma 35:15). What did Alma do about what he saw and felt? He didn\u2019t simply become discouraged or cynical about the state of the world. Instead, \u201che caused that his sons should be gathered together\u201d and taught them \u201cthings pertaining unto righteousness\u201d (Alma 35:16). He taught them that \u201cthere is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. \u2026 Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness\u201d (Alma 38:9).\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\n  Ideas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nAlma\u00a036\nI can be born of God as I am humble and repent.\n\nFew will have experiences as dramatic as Alma\u2019s conversion. But there are principles in his experience that we can all learn from and apply, because everyone must be \u201cborn of God\u201d (Alma 36:23). As you read Alma\u00a036, look for principles you can apply. For instance, how does someone who has been born of God feel about sin? about Jesus Christ? You could also look for changes you might expect to see in the beliefs and actions of someone who is born of God.\nSee also Mosiah 5:7; 27:25\u201326; Alma 5:14; 22:15; Helaman 3:35; \u201cConversion,\u201d Gospel Topics, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\n\n\n\n\nAlma\u00a036\nJesus Christ atoned for the sins of the world.\n\nYou may notice some repetition in Alma\u2019s account of his conversion in this chapter. That\u2019s because Alma\u00a036 is a great example of a form of Hebrew poetry called chiasmus, in which words or ideas are presented in a certain order, leading to a central idea, and then repeated in reverse order. In Alma\u00a036, the idea in verse\u00a03 is repeated in verse\u00a027, the idea in verse\u00a05 is repeated in verse\u00a026, and so on. The central idea is the most important message of the chiasmus. See if you can find the central idea in verses 17\u201318. Notice how catching \u201chold upon this thought\u201d affected Alma and changed his life. How has this truth affected you? What other repeated ideas do you find in this passage?\nHow does this account of repentance and forgiveness inspire you to follow Alma\u2019s example and turn to the Savior?\nFor more information about chiasmus, see Book of Mormon Student Manual (Church Educational System manual [2009], 232\u201333).\n\n\n\nAlma\u00a037\nThe scriptures have been preserved \u201cfor a wise purpose.\u201d\n\nHave you ever thought about what a miracle and blessing it is to have the scriptures today? God has \u201centrusted [us] with these things, which are sacred\u201d (Alma 37:14). As you read Alma\u00a037, look for the blessings that come from having the scriptures. How have you experienced these blessings? How can we use the scriptures to help \u201cshow forth [God\u2019s] power unto future generations\u201d? (Alma 37:18).\nIn Alma 37:38\u201347, Alma compares \u201cthe word of Christ\u201d to the Liahona. As you ponder this comparison, reflect on the ways you have experienced the miracle and power of Christ\u2019s teachings \u201cday by day\u201d (Alma 37:40).\nSee also D.\u00a0Todd Christofferson, \u201cThe Blessing of Scripture,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 32\u201335.\n\n\n  ImageScriptures\n\nThe scriptures teach us how to follow God.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma 37:6\u20137\n\u201cBy small and simple things are great things brought to pass.\u201d\n\nSometimes we may feel like our problems are so big and complicated that the solutions must be big and complicated too. Yet time and time again, the Lord chooses to use \u201csmall and simple things\u201d (Alma 37:6) to accomplish His work and bless the lives of His children. As you read Alma 37:6\u20137, ponder and record ways you\u2019ve seen this principle at work in your life. What are some small and simple things the Lord uses to bless you and accomplish His work?\nSee also Alma 37:41\u201346; Dallin\u00a0H.

Here are some ideas.\n\n\nAlma 36:5\u201326\n\nAlthough Alma\u2019s experience was extraordinary, his conversion illustrates several principles that apply to all of us. Invite each family member to select a verse from Alma 36:5\u201326 that teaches about being \u201cborn of God.\u201d What do we learn from these verses? Perhaps family members could share how they have applied the principles Alma described.\n\n\n\nAlma 36:18\u201321,\u00a024\n\nHow could we use these verses to help someone see that repentance is a joyful experience, not a dreadful one? How can repentance inspire us to share the gospel with others?\n\n\n\nAlma 37:6\u20137, 38\u201346\n\nWhat are some of the \u201csmall and simple things\u201d (Alma 37:6) that bring about great things in our lives? In what ways is the word of Christ like the Liahona? How can we help each other study the scriptures more diligently?\n\n\n\nAlma 37:35\n\nWhy is it wise to learn to keep the commandments while \u201cin [our] youth\u201d?\n\n\n\nAlma 38:12\n\nDoes your family know what a bridle is? Maybe you could show them a picture of one and talk about how it is used to control an animal. What does it mean to \u201cbridle [our] passions\u201d?

Ponder how you will do the same for the children you teach.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nShow a picture of a temple or another building, and explain that buildings need strong foundations so they won\u2019t fall down in wind and storms. To illustrate this, invite the children to try to move a rock by blowing on it. Read the first few lines of Helaman 5:12, and ask the children to raise their hands when they hear who the \u201crock\u201d is that should be our foundation.\n\n\nInvite the children to do actions as you read Helaman 5:12. For example, they could wave their arms when you read about the devil\u2019s \u201cmighty storm\u201d and stand in one place when you read about the \u201crock of our Redeemer.\u201d\n\n\nInvite the children to help you build a structure using blocks or other materials. Begin by forming a \u201csure foundation,\u201d and talk to them about how Jesus Christ should be the foundation of our lives. Ask the children to share things they can do to follow Jesus Christ, and let them add a block to the structure\u2019s foundation for each thing they share.\n\n\nInvite children to color the activity page, and help them cut it out. What can we do to build our lives on the foundation of Jesus Christ? Share some of the ways you have built your life on the Savior and how doing so has blessed your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelaman 5:21\u201352\nThe Holy Ghost whispers with a still, small voice.\n\nThe description in Helaman 5:29\u201330 and 45\u201347 of the voice that the Lamanites heard is similar to the way we often describe how the Holy Ghost speaks. You can use these verses to help the children recognize the voice of the Spirit.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nShare the account of Nephi and Lehi in prison. You might use \u201cChapter\u00a037: Nephi and Lehi in Prison\u201d (Book of Mormon Stories, 99\u2013102, or the corresponding video on ChurchofJesusChrist.org). When you talk about the voice the Lamanites heard, speak in a soft voice. Repeat the story a few times, and invite the children to whisper with you. Tell the children about times when the Holy Spirit has whispered to you and strengthened your testimony.\n\n\n\nRead Helaman 5:30, and sing with the children a song about the Holy Ghost, such as \u201cThe Still Small Voice\u201d (Children\u2019s Songbook, 106\u20137). Point out words in the scripture verse and the song that describe how the Holy Ghost speaks to us (see also Helaman 5:45\u201347). Use Helaman 5:29 and your own experiences to share with the children a few examples of good things the Holy Ghost can inspire us to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine: Older Children\n\n\n\nHelaman 1\u20136\nWhen I am humble, Heavenly Father will bless me.\n\nThe Book of Mormon contains many examples of the dangers of pride and the blessings of humility, and several of these examples appear in Helaman 1\u20136. As you study these chapters, ponder how you can use these examples to teach the children in your class.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nLet the children help you draw on the board the following diagram of the \u201cpride cycle.\u201d Read together Helaman 3:24, 33\u201334 and 4:11\u201315, and invite the children to point to the parts of the cycle these verses describe.\n\n\nWrite the words Humble and Prideful on the board. Write a few examples of humble or prideful actions on slips of paper, and invite the children to take turns selecting a paper and putting it next to the word on the board that describes that action. What are some of the ways we can choose to be humble?\n\n\n\n  ImageThe Pride Cycle\n\nThe \u201cpride cycle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelaman 5:5\u201314\nI will build my foundation on Jesus Christ.\n\nHelaman 5:12 contains powerful images of building our foundation on Jesus Christ. How can you use these images to illustrate this principle to the children? Doing so will help prepare the children for the temptations and trials they will face.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nBring to class a few kinds of materials that can represent weak or strong foundations (such as cotton balls or a flat stone or tile). Invite the children to build a tower using blocks or other materials on the different kinds of foundations. What makes some foundations stronger than others? Read together Helaman 5:12, and ask the children why they think Jesus Christ is \u201ca sure foundation\u201d for our lives. How can we build our lives on Him? Invite them to search Helaman 3:27\u201329 and 35 and Articles of Faith 1:4 to find ideas.\n\n\nInvite the children to scan Helaman 5:5\u201314 and count how many times the word \u201cremember\u201d is mentioned. What did Helaman teach his sons that they should remember? How can remembering these things help us make Jesus Christ the foundation of our lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelaman 5:20\u201352\nRepentance replaces spiritual darkness with light.\n\nThe Lamanites who went to the prison to kill Nephi and Lehi were surrounded by literal darkness. When we sin, we are in spiritual darkness. Helaman 5:20\u201352 teaches us how our spiritual \u201ccloud of darkness\u201d can be lifted (verse\u00a041).\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nMake the classroom as dark as possible; then read or summarize the account in Helaman 5:20\u201340 using a small flashlight. How might the Lamanites have felt while in the dark? Invite the children to listen for what Aminadab taught the people to do so that the darkness would be lifted, and then read verse\u00a041. Then turn the lights on, and read verses 42\u201348 together. What do these verses teach us about the blessings that repentance brings to our lives?\n\n\nInvite the children to imagine that they are teaching a younger child about the Holy Ghost. How could they use Helaman 5:29\u201333, 44\u201347 to teach what the voice of the Spirit feels like and some of the things the Spirit tells us? How has the Holy Ghost inspired you to repent? Invite the children to share experiences when they have felt the peace and comfort of the Holy Ghost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nEncourage Learning at Home\n\nInvite the children to ask family members about how they have built their lives on Jesus Christ. Or they could share with their families how they plan to build their own lives on Him.\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nTestify of Jesus Christ. You have a sacred opportunity to help strengthen the growing testimonies of the children in your class.

What do they understand about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that helps them endure? After teaching the Hebrew Saints about faith, Paul encouraged them to exercise their faith in Jesus Christ like other faithful people had done. This lesson can help you increase your desire to live by faith in Jesus Christ and recognize the blessings God gives you because of your faith.\n\n\nActing in faith\n\nThink of individuals in the scriptures or Church history or people you know who were blessed by God because they exercised faith in Jesus Christ. The following images might help you remember some of these accounts.\n  ImageCity of Zion translated\n  ImageTouch of faith\n  ImageTwo Thousand Stripling Warriors\n  ImageJoseph Smith in Liberty Jail\n\n\nWhat stands out to you in this person\u2019s story?\n\n\nHow are we influenced when we hear or share stories of faith? Why?\n\n\nIn the previous lesson, you learned about what it means for you to have faith in Jesus Christ. Think of how exercising increased faith in Him could strengthen you in areas where you may feel weak and vulnerable. It may help to record these impressions in your study journal. As you study today, ponder how you can increase your desire and ability to exercise your faith.\n\n\n\nThose who live \u201cby faith\u201d\n\nAs recorded in Hebrews 11, Paul shared many examples of individuals in the Old Testament who lived \u201cby faith\u201d and \u201cthrough faith.\u201d You may notice these phrases repeated multiple times in Hebrews 11 . As you study some of the examples Paul shared with the Hebrew Saints, think about how God\u2019s love and generosity were shown in the rewards and blessings He bestowed upon those who acted in faith.\nCreate a two-column chart in your study journal similar to the following.

One of the truths illustrated throughout this chapter is taught in Hebrews 11:6 : God rewards those who exercise faith in Jesus Christ. If you haven\u2019t already done so, consider marking \u201che is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him\u201d in verse 6 .\n\n\nHow could diligently seeking God be a way to exercise your faith?\n\n\nWhy do you think Heavenly Father is pleased when we exercise our faith?\n\n\n   2. Answer the following questions in your study journal: \n\n\nWhy do you think exercising faith is necessary for us to receive God\u2019s blessings in our lives?\n\n\nWhat can help you endure when blessings for faithful actions don\u2019t seem to come?\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving by faith\n\nIn addition to blessing many people in the past for exercising faith in Him, God is also \u201ca rewarder of them that diligently seek him\u201d ( Hebrews 11:6) in our day.\nIf possible, watch \u201cPure and Simple Faith\u201d (5:21), available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org.

Faith in the Savior is a principle of action and of power.\u202fFirst we act in faith; then the power comes\u2014according to God\u2019s will and timing. The sequence is crucial. The required action, though, is always tiny when compared to the blessings we ultimately receive [see Mosiah 2:24\u201325 ].\n\n(Dale G.

Think about how their examples can influence you to exercise greater faith in your life. These videos are available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nVideo: \u201cMy New Life\u201d (8:20)\n\nVideo: \u201cSealed Together: The Manaus Temple Caravan\u201d [14:14]\n\nVideo: \u201cLiving beyond \u2018What If?\u2019: Cambry Kaylor\u201d [14:47]\n\nVideo excerpt: \u201cFaith Is Not by Chance, but by Choice\u201d [10:49\u201314:13]\n\n\n\n\nIf I don\u2019t receive answers or blessings, am I not faithful enough?\n\nElder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:\n\n  ImageRonald A. Rasband\nMiracles, signs, and wonders abound among followers of Jesus Christ today, in your lives and in mine. \u2026\n\u2026 They are not always what we ask for or what we expect, but when we trust in the Lord, He will be there, and He will be right. He will suit the miracle to the moment we need it. \u2026\nThere are times we hope for a miracle to heal a loved one, to reverse an unjust act, or to soften the heart of a bitter or disillusioned soul. Looking at things through mortal eyes, we want the Lord to intervene, to fix what is broken. Through faith, the miracle will come, though not necessarily on our timetable or with the resolution we desired. Does that mean we are less than faithful or do not merit His intervention? No. We are beloved of the Lord. He gave His life for us, and His Atonement continues to release us from burdens and sin as we repent and draw close to Him.\nThe Lord has reminded us, \u201cNeither are your ways my ways\u201d [ Isaiah 55:8 ].\u202fHe offers, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d [ Matthew 11:28 ]\u2014rest from worry, disappointment, fear, disobedience, concern for loved ones, for lost or broken dreams. Peace amidst confusion or sorrow is a miracle. Remember the Lord\u2019s words: \u201cDid I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?\u201d [ Doctrine and Covenants 6:23 ].\u202fThe miracle is that Jesus Christ, the Great Jehovah, the Son of the Highest, is responding with peace. \n\n(Ronald A.

We see Paul encouraging Timothy and Titus, two leaders of congregations, in their Church service. We see him entreating his friend Philemon to reconcile with a fellow Saint and treat him like a brother in the gospel. Paul\u2019s words were not addressed to us directly, and he may never have expected that so many people would one day read them. Yet we find in these epistles counsel and encouragement for us, whatever our personal ministry in the service of Christ might be.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nWho were Timothy and Titus?\n\nTimothy and Titus had served with Paul on some of his missionary journeys. During their service, they earned Paul\u2019s respect and trust. Timothy was later called as a Church leader in Ephesus, and Titus was called as a leader in Crete. In these epistles, Paul gave Timothy and Titus instruction and encouragement regarding their responsibilities, which included preaching the gospel and calling men to serve as bishops.\nSee also Bible Dictionary, \u201cPauline Epistles,\u201d \u201cTimothy,\u201d \u201cTitus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n  ImageGhana: Missionaries Visiting\n\n\u201cLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers\u201d (1 Timothy 4:12).\n\n\n1\u00a0Timothy 4:10\u201316\n\u201cBe thou an example of the believers.\u201d\n\nTimothy was relatively young, but Paul knew that he could be a great Church leader despite his youth.

They had read prophecies in the Book of Mormon about the gathering of Israel and the building up of Zion (see 3\u00a0Nephi 21). How would that happen? The revelations Hiram Page claimed to receive addressed that subject, which only increased members\u2019 curiosity (see Doctrine and Covenants\u00a028). Other people wondered about the Fall of Adam and Eve and spiritual death. The Lord welcomed these questions in 1830: \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in faith,\u201d He told the Saints, \u201cbeing united in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants 29:6). And He welcomes our questions today; He\u2019s just waiting for us to ask Him in prayer. In fact, as the doctrinally rich revelation in Doctrine and Covenants\u00a029 shows, He sometimes responds by imparting truth and knowledge beyond the questions we asked in the first place.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a029\n  Heavenly Father prepared the perfect plan for our exaltation.\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a029 teaches many truths about God\u2019s plan for His children. As you read, look for truths you learn about each of the following parts of the plan:\n\n\nPremortal life (see verses\u00a036\u201337)\n\n\nCreation (see verses\u00a031\u201333)\n\n\nThe Fall of Adam and Eve (see verses\u00a040\u201341)\n\n\nMortal life (see verses\u00a039, 42\u201345)\n\n\nThe Atonement of Jesus Christ (see verses\u00a01, 42\u201343, 46\u201350)\n\n\nThe Resurrection (see verses\u00a013,\u00a026)\n\n\nThe Final Judgment (see verses\u00a012\u201313, 27\u201330)\n\n\nWhat new insights did you gain?

What does this image teach you about the Savior\u2019s desire to gather you? As you read Doctrine and Covenants 29:1\u20138, look for insights about why we gather, who will gather, and how we can help gather the \u201celect\u201d (verse\u00a07).\nIn our day, gathering to Zion means uniting in stakes of Zion around the world. How does gathering as Saints help us \u201cbe prepared in all things\u201d for the tribulations that will come before the Savior\u2019s Second Coming?

The revelation goes on to explain some of the reasons we need a Redeemer. Consider how you would use verses\u00a036\u201350 to explain why we need redemption through the Savior Jesus Christ. In many faith traditions, the Fall is seen as a tragedy; what do you find in these verses that teaches the positive results of the Fall? (See also 1\u00a0Corinthians 15:22; 2\u00a0Nephi 2:6\u20138, 15\u201329; Mosiah 3:1\u201319; Moses 5:9\u201312.)\n\n\n  ImageD&C Banner\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\n  Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a029.You could use the images at the end of this outline along with Doctrine and Covenants\u00a029 to teach your family about the plan of salvation. For example, family members could learn about different parts of the plan by reading and discussing the verses suggested. They could find additional truths in Gospel Topics (topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org) or the Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Write down what you learn.

The scriptures teach us that all of God\u2019s creations testify of Jesus Christ (see Moses 6:62\u201363), so look for Him as you read the scriptures. Consider noting or marking verses that teach about Him.\n\n"}, {"text": "\nRecord Your ImpressionsCreate a Note\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nInvite Sharing\n\nGive class members a few minutes to review the scriptures they read at home and find a passage that they found meaningful. Then invite them to share what they learned with another person in the class.\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:1\u201315\nWe should trust God rather than fearing man.\n\n\n\nLike Joseph Smith, we all have experiences when we feel pressured by other people to do something we know is wrong. What truths do we learn from Doctrine and Covenants 3:1\u201315 that can help us remain faithful to God in such situations?\n\n\nJoseph Smith needed to be chastened for fearing man more than God, but he also needed to be encouraged. Invite class members to look in section\u00a03 for how the Lord both chastened and encouraged Joseph. For example, they could list on the board phrases from verses 1\u201315 containing the Lord\u2019s rebukes and other phrases containing His encouragement to repent and remain faithful. What does Joseph\u2019s experience teach us about how the Savior helps us overcome our mistakes?\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a04\nThe Lord asks us to serve Him with all our heart.\n\n\n\nThe qualities describing the Lord\u2019s servants that are listed in Doctrine and Covenants 4:5\u20136 are also the qualities of Jesus Christ. To help class members learn more, you could invite them to choose one of the qualities and find definitions or additional scriptures that help them better understand the quality (see, for example, the statement by Sister Elaine\u00a0S. Dalton in \u201cAdditional Resources\u201d). You could invite a few people to share what they found. They could also share why the quality they chose is a requirement for service in God\u2019s kingdom. How can we further develop these qualities? (see verse\u00a07).\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a04 was addressed to Joseph Smith\u00a0Sr., who wanted to know how he could help with the Lord\u2019s work. This section can also help any of us who desire to serve the Lord. Here\u2019s one way to study this section: class members could work in small groups to write a job description for servants of God, using section\u00a04 as a guide. How are these qualifications different from other job descriptions? Why are these qualities essential in doing God\u2019s work? The statement by Elder David\u00a0A. Bednar in \u201cAdditional Resources\u201d can help class members understand the importance of developing these qualities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a05\nA witness of the truth comes to those who are humble and believing.\n\n\n\nIf the gold plates were displayed for the world to see, would that convince everyone that the Book of Mormon is true? Why or why not? (see Doctrine and Covenants 5:7). Perhaps class members could search section\u00a05 for insights that could help them respond to someone who asks for evidence that the Book of Mormon is true. What did the Lord teach Joseph Smith and Martin Harris that can help us gain our own witness of gospel truths?\n\n  ImageMartin Harris\n\nMartin Harris, by Lewis\u00a0A. Ramsey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\nVirtue means strength.\n\nSister Elaine\u00a0S. Dalton gave this explanation of virtue: \u201cVirtue is a word we don\u2019t hear often in today\u2019s society, but the Latin root word virtus means strength. Virtuous women and men possess a quiet dignity and inner strength. They are confident because they are worthy to receive and be guided by the Holy Ghost\u201d (\u201cA Return to Virtue,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008,\u00a079).\n\n\n\nBecoming a missionary.\n\nElder David\u00a0A. Bednar said: \u201cThe process of becoming a missionary does not require a young man to wear a white shirt and tie [or a young woman to wear a dress] to school every day or to follow the missionary guidelines for going to bed and getting up. \u2026 But you can increase in your desire to serve God [see Doctrine and Covenants 4:3], and you can begin to think as missionaries think, to read what missionaries read, to pray as missionaries pray, and to feel what missionaries feel. You can avoid the worldly influences that cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw, and you can grow in confidence in recognizing and responding to spiritual promptings\u201d (\u201cBecoming a Missionary,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2005, 45\u201346).\n\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nAsk questions that encourage meaningful discussion. Questions that have more than one right answer invite learners to respond based on their personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences. For example, you could ask, \u201cHow do you know when God is speaking to you?\u201d (See Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way, 33.)\n\n"}, {"text": "\n\n  ImageNew Testament stories [art]\n\nJesus was going to Jerusalem.

Keetch (1960\u20132018) of the Seventy met some surfers who had traveled there on a once-in-a-lifetime trip. They were complaining about a heavy mesh barrier in the water, keeping them from being able to surf the big waves.\nTo discover what happened, watch the video \u201cBlessed and Happy Are Those Who Keep the Commandments of God\u201d (5:41) from time code 0:00 to 2:34.

Read the following verses, looking for what the Apostle John taught that can motivate us to keep them. It may be helpful to remember that John wrote his epistles to believers who were being confronted with false teachings.\n1 John 2:3\u20136\n1 John 3:18\u201324\n2 John 1:6, 8\u20139\n(It may also be useful to read the Savior\u2019s teachings in John 14:15, 23\u201324.)\n\n\nWhat truths did you find?\n\n\n\n\nHow might knowing these truths increase someone\u2019s desire to keep the commandments?\n\n\nJohn taught various truths in these verses. One of them you may have identified is that the more we know and love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, the more we are willing to keep Their commandments (see 1 John 1:5\u20137; 2:3\u20136; 2 John 1:6\u20139).\n   1. Complete the following activity in your study journal: \nImagine that your Sunday School teacher wants to help members of your class feel motivated to keep the commandments. She asks you to ponder the following questions and prepare to share your thoughts in class:\n\n\nWhy is keeping the commandments a way to show love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\n\n\nWhat do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that motivates you to keep Their commandments? Why does knowing that motivate you?\n\n\nWhat have you learned about Them as you have kept Their commandments?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will you show your love to Heavenly Father?\n\nLook at this picture and think about what you know about Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father and how They feel about you. You may also want to think about how you feel about Them.\n  ImageEmbracing Christ\nWhile it may seem difficult to show our love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ because They are not physically present with us, we can show our love for Them by keeping Their commandments. Take some time to ponder what you would like to remember or do because of this lesson. The following are some ways you could do this:\n\n\nWrite down one way you would like to come to know and love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ more.\n\n\nThink about commandments that you are currently keeping and why you are keeping them. Consider whether you are motivated by love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or whether you could improve in that area.\n\n\nIdentify one or more commandments you could more fully keep to show your love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

Monson (1927\u20132018) stated:\n\n\n  ImageMonson, Thomas S.\nGod\u2019s commandments are not given to frustrate us or to become obstacles to our happiness. Just the opposite is true. He who created us and who loves us perfectly knows just how we need to live our lives in order to obtain the greatest happiness possible. He has provided us with guidelines which, if we follow them, will see us safely through this often treacherous mortal journey. \u2026\n\u2026 He understands that when we keep the commandments, our lives will be happier, more fulfilling, and less complicated. Our challenges and problems will be easier to bear, and we will receive His promised blessings.\n\n(Thomas S.

On another occasion, he taught:\n\n  ImageDallin H. Oaks Official Portrait 2018\nBecause we have the truth about the Godhead and our relationship to Them, the purpose of life, and the nature of our eternal destiny, we have the ultimate road map and assurance for our journey through mortality.\n\n(Dallin H.

In this lesson, you will have the opportunity to learn more about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost and to ponder how learning about Them can help you in your life.\n\n\n\nThe scriptures teach about the Godhead\n\n\nConsider inviting students to share what they prepared for class by having them write down what they know about the Godhead and how they know it.\n\nDivide a sheet of paper into three columns and label the top of the first column \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201dthe second column \u201cJesus Christ,\u201dand the third column \u201cThe Holy Ghost.\u201dInside each respective column, write down one or two things you know about this member of the Godhead. Include a brief explanation of how you learned each truth or why you believe it. Throughout the lesson, take the opportunity to add to these columns what you learn about each member of the Godhead.\n\nThis activity can also be done as a class by making three columns on the board. Students could be invited to come up to the board to add different insights throughout the lesson.\n\nOne place in scripture where we can learn more about the Godhead is when Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist.\n\nDisplay an image of Jesus Christ\u2019s baptism.\n\n  ImageJohn the Baptist Baptizing Jesus\nRead about Jesus Christ\u2019s baptism in one or more of the following Gospel accounts, looking for what you can learn about each member of the Godhead:\n\nStudents may identify truths similar to the following: the Godhead are three separate and distinct beings, Jesus Christ submits to the will of the Father, Jesus Christ fulfills all righteousness, Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost bear record of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost confirms ordinances, Heavenly Father is pleased with obedience to Him.\n\n\n\nMatthew 3:13\u201317\n\n\nMark 1:9\u201311\n\n\nLuke 3:21\u201322\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you learn about each member of the Godhead?\n\n\n\nListen carefully as students share, then use some or all of the following information to help them better understand the Godhead.\n\nThese verses help us understand that each member of the Godhead is a separate being and fulfills an important role in our lives. For example, the Savior gave us an example of doing the will of the Father. When God was pleased with Jesus Christ at His baptism, He showed that He is a loving Heavenly Father who is happy when we obey Him.\n\n\nWhen have you felt that Heavenly Father was pleased with you for something you did? How did knowing He was pleased affect you?\n\n\n\nSome students may initially think that they have never done anything that pleased Heavenly Father. It may help to ask them to carefully ponder these questions and pay attention to their thoughts and feelings. Identifying times when they felt love, joy, peace, or goodness (feelings that come from the Holy Ghost) could help students see times that Heavenly Father was happy with their actions (see Galatians 5:22).\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith (1805\u201344) explained that the Holy Ghost did not appear as a dove. Instead, the dove showed that the Holy Ghost was present. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cThe Holy Ghost cannot be transformed into a dove; but the sign of a dove was given to John to signify the truth of the deed\u201d (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 81).\n\n\nWhen has the Holy Ghost testified of truth to you?\n\n\nWhat questions do you have about the Godhead?\n\n\n\nUse these or other available options that will best meet the needs of the students. Instead of asking students to choose an option, it may also be helpful to study together as a class or watch one of the videos together.\n\nChoose one or more of the following options to help you find answers to your questions about the Godhead. As you study, also look for ways that understanding the Godhead can bless you personally.\n\n\nSearch for additional insights in the scriptures. You may want to look under \u201c God, Godhead \u201d in the Guide to the Scriptures or \u201c Godhead \u201d in the Topical Guide.\n\n\nStudy teachings from prophets and apostles about the Godhead.

Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained:\n\n  ImageJeffrey R. Holland\nWe believe these three divine persons constituting a single Godhead are united in purpose, in manner, in testimony, in mission. We believe Them to be filled with the same godly sense of mercy and love, justice and grace, patience, forgiveness, and redemption. I think it is accurate to say we believe They are one in every significant and eternal aspect imaginable except believing Them to be three persons combined in one substance, a Trinitarian notion never set forth in the scriptures because it is not true. \u2026\nWe declare it is self-evident from the scriptures that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are separate persons, three divine beings, noting such unequivocal illustrations as the Savior\u2019s great Intercessory Prayer [see John 17 ] \u2026, His baptism at the hands of John [see Matthew 3:13\u201317 ; Mark 1:9\u201311 ; Luke 3:21\u201322 ], the experience on the Mount of Transfiguration [see Mark 9:7 ; Luke 9:35 ], and the martyrdom of Stephen [see Acts 7:55\u201356 ]\ufeff\u2014to name just four.\n\n(Jeffrey R.

Did the Holy Ghost appear as a dove?\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith (1805\u201344) explained:\n\n  ImageJoseph Smith Jr.\nThe sign of the dove was instituted before the creation of the world, a witness for the Holy Ghost, and the devil cannot come in the sign of a dove. The Holy Ghost is a personage, and is in the form of a personage. It does not confine itself to the form of the dove, but in sign of the dove. The Holy Ghost cannot be transformed into a dove; but the sign of a dove was given to John to signify the truth of the deed, as the dove is an emblem or token of truth and innocence.\n\n(Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 81)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\nAlternate student preparation\n\nInvite students to think of one example of how Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are united in purpose but fulfill different roles. (For example, we pray to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost helps us recognize the answers to our prayers.)\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\nPrimary leaders are responsible to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all children, including those with disabilities. In Primary, every child should be welcomed, loved, nurtured, and included. In this atmosphere it is easier for all children to understand the love of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and to feel and recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost. The following ideas can help you meet the needs of children with disabilities.\n\n\nLearn about the child\u2019s specific needs. The best way to do this is to talk to the child\u2019s parents or caregivers. Find out how the child best learns and what strategies are most helpful. You could also counsel with other Primary leaders and teachers who have experience and insights to share.\n\n\nCreate a positive atmosphere in which every child feels safe and loved. Learn the names of all the children in your class, and help them feel accepted, loved, and included. Children with disabilities are often criticized, so look for opportunities to praise them for positive behaviors.\n\n\nMake adjustments so everyone can participate. Small changes can be made to activities to ensure that all children can learn, including those with physical limitations or learning difficulties. For instance, if an activity suggests showing a picture, you could sing a related song instead to include children with visual impairments.\n\n\nEstablish consistent classroom routines and structure. One way to do this is to create a poster with the class schedule outlining how the class will flow. Your schedule might include prayers, teaching time, and activity time. This can help reduce feelings of uncertainty, which may increase anxiety in some children.\n\n\nUse visual cues. Children with learning disabilities or behavioral challenges may benefit from visual cues, such as pictures modeling appropriate behaviors like raising one\u2019s hand before answering a question.\n\n\nUnderstand why challenging behaviors happen. Learn about disabilities or circumstances that may influence a child to act inappropriately. Pay careful attention to what is happening when challenging behaviors arise. Prayerfully consider how to modify the situation in order to better support the child.\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\nRecord Your ImpressionsCreate a Note\nThe traditional Jewish name for the book of Psalms is a Hebrew word that means \u201cpraises.\u201d That word, Tehillim, is also related to the exclamation \u201challelujah\u201d (meaning \u201cpraise Jehovah\u201d or \u201cpraise the Lord\u201d). If you had to choose one word to sum up the main message of the Psalms, \u201cpraise\u201d would be a good choice. Some of the Psalms contain the direct invitation to \u201cpraise ye the Lord\u201d (see especially Psalms 146\u201350), and all of them can inspire a feeling of worship and praise. The Psalms invite us to reflect on the Lord\u2019s power, on His mercy, and on the great things He has done. We can never repay Him for any of this, but we can praise Him for it. That praise may take different forms for different people\u2014it may involve singing, praying, or bearing testimony. It often leads to a deeper commitment to the Lord and to following His teachings.

As you read, look for words like walk, path, way, feet, and wander. Ponder your own life\u2019s journey\u2014where you\u2019ve been, where you are now, and what direction you are headed. What do you learn from this psalm about your journey back home? According to this psalm, what has God provided to help you stay on the right path?\nYou might be interested to know that in the original Hebrew, the first eight verses in Psalm\u00a0119 begin with the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet.

But none of us get through this life without a trial of faith. We can all benefit from the example of people like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were taken captive as young men by the mighty Babylonian Empire (see 2\u00a0Kings 24:10\u201316). These young people were surrounded by an unfamiliar culture with different values, and they faced great temptations to abandon their beliefs and righteous traditions. Yet they remained true to their covenants. Like Joseph in Egypt and Esther in Persia, Daniel and his friends in Babylon kept their faith in God, and God worked miracles that still inspire believers to this day.\nHow did they find the strength to remain so faithful? They did those small and simple things that God has asked all of us to do\u2014praying, fasting, choosing good friends, trusting in God, and being a light to others. As we are strengthened by doing these same small and simple things, we can face the lions and fiery furnaces in our own lives with faith.\nFor an overview of the book of Daniel, see \u201cDaniel, book\u00a0of\u201d in the Bible Dictionary.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nDaniel\u00a01; 3; 6\nI can trust in the Lord when my faith is tried.\n\nIn a sense, we all live in Babylon.

As you read Daniel\u00a01, 3, and 6, note the ways in which Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were pressured to do things they knew were wrong. Have you ever felt pressure to compromise your beliefs? What do you learn from these men that can help you trust in the Lord when you face opposition?\n  The book of Daniel and many other scriptures record experiences where great faith led to great miracles. But what if our faith doesn\u2019t lead to the miracles we seek? (see, for example, Alma 14:8\u201313). Based on what you read in Daniel 3:13\u201318, how do you think Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego would have answered this question? How can their example affect how you approach your trials of faith?

Because they rejected him, he returned with stern warnings of the judgments of God. But those warnings consistently included a merciful invitation to repent; look for these invitations throughout Helaman 13\u201315 (see especially Helaman 13:6, 11; 14:15\u201319; 15:7\u20138). How do these invitations apply to you? What do you learn from these verses about repentance? When have you experienced the mercy of God that comes from repentance?\n\n\n\nHelaman 14; 16:13\u201323\nSigns and wonders can strengthen the faith of those who do not harden their hearts.\n\nIn Helaman\u00a014, Samuel explained the reason the Lord provided signs of the Savior\u2019s birth and death: \u201cTo the intent that ye might believe on his name\u201d (Helaman 14:12). As you study Helaman\u00a014, note the signs of the Savior\u2019s birth in verses 1\u20138 and the signs of His death in verses 20\u201328. Why do you think these signs would be effective ways to signify the birth and death of Jesus Christ?\nCan you think of any signs the Lord has given to help you believe in Him? For instance, prophets have predicted signs that will appear before the Savior\u2019s Second Coming (see \u201cSigns of the Times,\u201d Guide to the Scriptures, scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Have any of these signs been fulfilled in our day? Other signs that lead to faith in Jesus Christ may be more personal and less dramatic. Take a moment to ponder ways you have witnessed His hand in your life.\nWhat caution is given about signs in Helaman 16:13\u201323? How can you avoid the attitude of the people described in these verses?\nSee also Alma 30:43\u201352; Ronald\u00a0A.

What more was there to say about two nations that were utterly destroyed? But Moroni had seen our times (see Mormon 8:35), and he was inspired to \u201cwrite a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth \u2026 in some future day\u201d (Moroni 1:4). He knew that widespread apostasy was coming, bringing with it confusion about priesthood ordinances and religion in general. This may be why he gave clarifying details about the sacrament, baptism, conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the blessings of gathering with fellow believers to \u201ckeep [each other] in the right way, \u2026 relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of [our] faith\u201d (Moroni 6:4).

How can you follow his example?\n\n\n\n\nMoroni 2\u20136\nPriesthood ordinances must be administered as the Lord commands.\n\nDuring His mortal ministry, the Savior received and administered sacred ordinances, such as baptism (see Matthew 3:13\u201317; Joseph Smith Translation, John 4:1\u20133 [in the Bible appendix]), priesthood ordination (see Mark 3:13\u201319), and the sacrament (see Matthew 26:26\u201328). However, because of the Great Apostasy, many people today are confused about how ordinances must be performed\u2014and even whether they are needed at all. In Moroni 2\u20136, Moroni provided important details about certain priesthood ordinances that can help clear up some of that confusion. What impressions come as you learn about the ordinances in these chapters? The following are some questions you might ask to help you learn:\n\n\nConfirmation (Moroni\u00a02; 6:4).What do the Savior\u2019s instructions in Moroni 2:2 teach you about the ordinance of confirmation? What do you think it means to be \u201cwrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost\u201d? (Moroni 6:4).\n\n\nPriesthood ordination (Moroni\u00a03).What do you find in this chapter that could help someone prepare to be ordained to the priesthood? What do you find that would help someone perform an ordination?\n\n\nThe sacrament (Moroni 4\u20135; 6:6).Note the promises in the sacrament prayers (see Moroni 4:3; 5:2), and ponder what you are doing to keep your promises. What can you do to invite the influence of the Spirit more powerfully as you participate in the sacrament?\n\n\nBaptism (Moroni 6:1\u20133).What can you do to continue to meet the qualifications for baptism given in these verses, even after you are baptized? What do these verses suggest to you about what it means to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ?\n\n\nBased on what you have learned, how will you change the ways you think about, participate in, or prepare others for these ordinances? Why is it important that these ordinances be \u201cadministered \u2026 according to the commandments of Christ\u201d? (Moroni 4:1).\nSee also \u201cOrdinances,\u201d Gospel Topics, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\n\n  ImagePriesthood power\n\nJesus taught how ordinances should be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoroni 6:4\u20139\nDisciples of Jesus Christ look after the welfare of each other\u2019s souls.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that we all \u201cwork out [our] own salvation\u201d (Mormon 9:27), Moroni also taught that \u201cmeet[ing] together oft\u201d with fellow believers can help keep us \u201cin the right way\u201d (Moroni 6:4\u20135). As you read Moroni 6:4\u20139, ponder the blessings that come from being \u201cnumbered among the people of the church of Christ\u201d (Moroni 6:4).

Perhaps family members could discuss phrases from these prayers that are especially meaningful to them. They could also record their thoughts about these phrases or draw a picture that helps them think about the Savior. They could bring what they wrote or drew to sacrament meeting to help them focus their thoughts on Him.

Some false teachers were even questioning whether Jesus Christ had actually appeared \u201cin the flesh\u201d (see, for example, 1\u00a0John 4:1\u20133; 2\u00a0John 1:7). What could a Church leader do in such a situation? The Apostle John responded by sharing his personal witness of the Savior: \u201cThis is the testimony which we give of that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life\u201d (Joseph Smith Translation, 1\u00a0John 1:1 [in 1\u00a0John 1:1, footnote\u00a0a]). And then John taught about love: God\u2019s love for us and the love we should have for Him and all His children. After all, John was a witness of that, too. He had personally experienced the Savior\u2019s love (see John 13:23; 20:2), and he wanted the Saints to feel that same love. John\u2019s testimony and teachings on love are just as needed today, when faith in Jesus Christ is questioned and false teachings abound. Reading John\u2019s epistles can help us face today\u2019s adversities with courage, for \u201cthere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear\u201d (1\u00a0John 4:18).\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\n1\u00a0John; 2\u00a0John\nGod is light, and God is love.\n\nIf you were to choose one or two words to describe God, what would they be?

As you read the first two epistles of John, ponder the experiences John had with the Savior\u2019s light and love. For example, consider what John learned from Jesus\u2019s teachings in John 3:16\u201317; 12:35\u201336, 46; 15:9\u201314; 19:25\u201327.

It marks the beginning of a different tone, a different emphasis in the prophet\u2019s message. Where Isaiah\u2019s earlier writings warned Israel and Judah about destruction and captivity that would come because of their sins, these later prophecies were meant to comfort the Jews over 150\u00a0years in the future\u2014after Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was desecrated, and the people were taken captive by Babylon. But these prophecies reach even further into the future than to the defeated, disheartened Israelites. They speak to us, who also sometimes feel defeated, disheartened, and even lost.\nIsaiah\u2019s message to them and to us is simple: \u201cFear not\u201d (Isaiah 43:1). All is not lost. The Lord has not forgotten you, and He has power over situations that seem out of your control. Isn\u2019t the Lord \u201che that created the heavens, and \u2026 he that spread forth the earth, and \u2026 he that giveth breath unto the people upon it\u201d? (Isaiah 42:5).

How have these choices affected you and others? What choices do members of your quorum or class face that can draw them closer to or away from the Savior?

What insights can we find in Mormon 7:6\u20137; 9:3\u20134, 13\u201314,\u00a029? According to these verses, why do our choices matter?

This is one lesson that quorum or class members can learn from the video \u201cGoing to Grandma\u2019s\u201d (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). You might show this video to the quorum or class and ask, \u201cWhat did Chloe understand about her grandma that made it easier to follow her direction? What do we know about Heavenly Father and the Savior that can make it easier to obey Their commandments?\u201d You might also read some of the scriptures in \u201cSupporting Resources.\u201d What do we find in these scriptures that inspires us to make good choices?\n\n\n\nTo help members of your quorum or class better understand why their choices matter, invite them to silently read \u201cAgency and Accountability\u201d in For the Strength of Youth. They could then share what impressed them. To further discuss the importance of our choices, members of your quorum or class could choose one or more additional topics in For the Strength of Youth and talk about consequences that can come from obeying or disobeying the Lord\u2019s standards. Why is it important for us to keep an eternal perspective when we make choices?\n\n\nIn his message \u201cSmall and Simple Things,\u201d President Dallin\u00a0H.

Reviewing the account of the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea could remind class members of times when God delivered them from their trials. You might ask class members to review Exodus\u00a014 and share what most inspires them about this account. Also encourage them to share their experiences with being delivered from trials, along with verses from the chapter that build their faith that God can deliver us.\n\n\nIt might also be interesting to read together Doctrine and Covenants 8:2\u20133. What do these verses teach about Moses? How do these verses affect the way we think about the events in Exodus\u00a014? What do they suggest about how we seek deliverance from our trials?

Maybe each class member could study one of the following passages, looking for spiritual messages: Exodus 15:23\u201327; 16:1\u201315; 17:1\u20137. Give several class members a chance to share what they found. How might we use these accounts to encourage someone who has unmet temporal or spiritual needs?\n\n\nClass members could also read these verses and identify examples of murmuring. How might we explain to someone what it means to murmur? What are some of the consequences of murmuring that make it so dangerous? Perhaps class members could share advice on how to avoid the temptation to murmur against the Lord when we experience difficult trials.\n\n\nIt might help class members to compare the manna described in Exodus\u00a016 with the nourishment our spirits need. What similarities do we see? What spiritual lessons might the Lord have wanted to teach the Israelites by sending manna in the way He did? (see John 6:31\u201335, 48\u201358).

For example, you could invite them to share something they learn about the Lord from Doctrine and Covenants 10:34\u201352 (see also Doctrine and Covenants 3:1\u20133). Class members could share how they have seen that the Lord\u2019s \u201cwisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil\u201d (Doctrine and Covenants 10:43).

Perhaps class members would be willing to share something from the section that is particularly relevant to them. How do they plan to apply what they learned?\n\n\nOne way to encourage discussion about Doctrine and Covenants\u00a011 is to invite class members to find a principle in the section and then write a question about it. Such questions might include \u201cWhat does it mean to cleave unto Christ with all of your heart?\u201d (verse\u00a019) or \u201cHow do we obtain God\u2019s word?\u201d (verse\u00a021). Class members could put their questions at the top of a piece of paper and pass their papers around the room, adding thoughts and possible answers to each other\u2019s questions.

What would they include from Doctrine and Covenants 11:8\u201326? For example, what would they write about preparing to receive guidance for our lives and answers to our questions? What would they say about how to recognize answers when they come? Invite class members to ponder how they will apply what they have learned as they strive to seek personal revelation.\nAs part of this activity, you could share this statement from Sister Julie\u00a0B. Beck, former Relief Society General President: \u201cThe ability to qualify for, receive, and act on personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be acquired in this life\u201d (\u201cAnd upon the Handmaids in Those Days Will I Pour Out My Spirit,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2010,\u00a011).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nInclude those who are struggling.

Share something that our prophet has taught, and encourage the children to follow his teachings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelaman 7:20\u201321\nThe Lord wants me to remember Him.\n\nThe children you teach will face distractions that could cause them to forget Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. How can you inspire the children to devote time to spiritual things?\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nRead together Helaman 7:20\u201321, and ask the children what they think it means to forget God. Explain that the word forget can also mean \u201cto neglect\u201d or \u201cignore.\u201d Display a picture of the Savior, and invite the children to draw things they might spend too much time doing that could cause them to forget the Lord. Put their drawings in front of the picture of Jesus. Ask the children to think of things they can do each day to remember Heavenly Father and Jesus. As they share their thoughts, take away the drawings one by one until the picture of the Savior is revealed.\n\n\nInvite the children to complete this week\u2019s activity page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelaman\u00a010\nWhen I ponder the words of God, I can receive revelation.\n\nDo the children you teach know what it means to ponder? Help them understand that Nephi was blessed with revelation when he pondered the things the Lord had shown him.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nHelp the children understand what it means to ponder (see \u201cPonder,\u201d Guide to the Scriptures, scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Invite them to think of other words that describe what ponder means. Then ask them to read Helaman 10:1\u20133 and replace the word ponder with the words they thought of. What happened when Nephi pondered the scriptures? (see Helaman 10:3\u20137). Share a time when you received revelation after pondering a scripture or a modern-day revelation or a spiritual experience.\n\n\nGive the children time to read Helaman\u00a010, or read it together, and encourage them to find a verse they would like to ponder during the coming week. Invite them to write the verse they chose on a paper or card and put it somewhere to remind them to ponder that verse during the upcoming week. In a future class, give them time to share what they learned as they pondered the verse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nEncourage Learning at Home\n\nEncourage the children to share with their families what they plan to do to remember Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ every day. They could also invite their families to join them in their goal.\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nExtend invitations that respect agency. When you invite children to act on what you have taught them, think of ways to honor their agency as they apply what they learn. For example, after a lesson about the Savior, you could ask, \u201cWhat will you do to remember the Savior this week?\u201d\n\n"}, {"text": "\n\nReverently\n\n\nRev\u2019rence is more than just quietly sitting:\nIt\u2019s thinking of Father above,\nA feeling I get when I think of his blessings.\nI\u2019m rev\u2019rent, for rev\u2019rence is love.\nWhen I\u2019m rev\u2019rent, it shows in my words and my deeds.\nThe pathway to follow is clear.\nAnd when I am rev\u2019rent, I know in my heart\nHeav\u2019nly Father and Jesus are near.\n\n\n\nWords and music: Maggie Olauson, b. 1949\nCopyright \u00a9 1987 by Maggie Olauson.

Prophecies were being fulfilled\u2014great signs and miracles among the people indicated that the Savior would soon be born. On the other hand, it was also an anxious time for believers because, in spite of all the miracles, unbelievers insisted that \u201cthe time was past\u201d for the Savior to be born (3\u00a0Nephi 1:5). These people caused \u201ca great uproar throughout the land\u201d (3\u00a0Nephi 1:7) and even set a date to kill all the believers if the sign prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite\u2014a night without darkness\u2014did not appear.\nIn these trying circumstances, the prophet Nephi \u201ccried mightily to his God in behalf of his people\u201d (3\u00a0Nephi 1:11). The Lord\u2019s response is inspiring to anyone who faces persecution or doubt and needs to know that light will overcome darkness: \u201cLift up your head and be of good cheer; \u2026 I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets\u201d (3\u00a0Nephi 1:13).\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 1:4\u201321; 5:1\u20133\nThe Lord will fulfill all His words.\n\nHow do you imagine you would have felt if you had been one of the believers during the time described in 3\u00a0Nephi 1\u20137? How might it have felt, for example, to wait for the night with no darkness that would announce the Savior\u2019s birth, knowing you would be killed if it didn\u2019t happen? As you read 3\u00a0Nephi 1:4\u201321 and 5:1\u20133, look for what Nephi and the other believers did to keep their faith during these difficult times. How did the Lord bless them? What do you learn that can help when you find yourself waiting for blessings promised by the Lord?\n\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 1:22; 2:1\u20133\n  Forgetting spiritual experiences makes me vulnerable to Satan\u2019s temptations.\n\nYou might think that witnessing something so miraculous as a night without darkness would stay with you for a long time and be an anchor to your testimony. But the memories of the signs and wonders the Nephites witnessed seemed to fade over time. What caused them to forget, and what were the results of forgetting? (see 3\u00a0Nephi 1:22; 2:1\u20133).\nWhat are you doing to remember and renew your witness of spiritual truths? For example, consider how recording your spiritual experiences can help you. How will you share your witness with those closest to you to help them believe?\nSee also Alma 5:6; Henry\u00a0B.

But we do face spiritual dangers, and the Nephites\u2019 experience may contain lessons that can help us. Look for these lessons as you read 3\u00a0Nephi 2:11\u201312 and 3:1\u201326.\nIn 3\u00a0Nephi 5:24\u201326 we read of the gathering of the Lord\u2019s people in the latter days.

(see Doctrine and Covenants 41:5). In 3\u00a0Nephi 5:12\u201326, Mormon interrupted his abridgment of the Nephite records and declared that he was a disciple of Jesus Christ. Then, in 3\u00a0Nephi 7:15\u201326, he described the ministry of another disciple\u2014the prophet Nephi.

Here are some ideas.\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 3:13\u201314, 25\u201326\n\nWhat did the Nephites do to protect themselves from the enemy they faced? What are we doing to make our home a place of safety and protection from the evil in the world?\n\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 2:1\u20133; 6:15\u201317\n\nTo help your family learn how Satan can deceive us, draw a body, and as your family reads 3\u00a0Nephi 2:1\u20133 and 6:15\u201317, mark the different parts of the body mentioned. According to these verses, what are some of the ways Satan tempts us to forget God and turn to sin?\n\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 4:7\u201312, 30\u201333\n\nWhat did the Nephites do when they saw the Gadianton robbers coming?

What can we learn from the Nephites\u2019 words after the Lord helped them in their time of difficulty?\n\n\n\n3\u00a0Nephi 5:13; Doctrine and Covenants 41:5\n\nRead 3\u00a0Nephi 5:13 and Doctrine and Covenants 41:5, and discuss what it means to be a disciple of Christ. Maybe family members could talk about times when they noticed each other being disciples. If you have small children, you might make a badge that says, \u201cI am a disciple of Jesus Christ,\u201d and let them wear the badge whenever you notice them following the Savior.\n\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week\u2019s outline in Come, Follow Me\u2014For Primary.\nSuggested song: \u201cI\u2019m Trying to Be like Jesus,\u201d Children\u2019s Songbook, 78\u201379.\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nHelp your family liken the scriptures to themselves. Nephi said, \u201cI did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning\u201d (1\u00a0Nephi 19:23). To help your family liken the scriptures to themselves, you could invite them to ponder what they would have done if they had been among the believers described in 3\u00a0Nephi 1:4\u20139.

What passages from section\u00a01 help them feel excited to read the Doctrine and Covenants? Perhaps you could ask them to search section\u00a01 for a verse they would share if they were trying to persuade someone to read this sacred book.\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a01\nThe Lord invites us to \u201csearch these commandments.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs you discuss the Lord\u2019s \u201cpreface\u201d to the Doctrine and Covenants (verse\u00a06), it might be helpful for someone in the class to explain what a preface is and the purpose it serves in a book. Then the class could discuss how section\u00a01 serves that purpose for the Doctrine and Covenants. For example, what themes for the book does section\u00a01 introduce? What purposes does the book have? What do we find in this section that could influence the way we read the Doctrine and Covenants this year?\n\n\nThis week\u2019s outline in Come, Follow Me\u2014For Individuals and Families invites us to consider how we will act on the Lord\u2019s command to \u201csearch these commandments\u201d (verse\u00a037). Perhaps class members could share what they plan to do this year to make their study of the Doctrine and Covenants meaningful. What will they search for? How is searching different from just reading? What study methods have they found most helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:1\u20136, 23\u201324, 37\u201339\nGod speaks through His servants, and His words will be fulfilled.\n\n\n\nMany of us have family members, friends, and acquaintances who do not share our beliefs about living prophets. Perhaps class members could share truths they find in section\u00a01 that they could use to respond to someone who questions their beliefs about prophets. You might suggest that they look particularly in verses 1\u20136 and 37\u201339. What do these verses teach about the Lord and His prophets?\n\n\nClass members might be interested to learn that when a council called by Joseph Smith discussed publishing the Prophet\u2019s revelations, some council members opposed the idea. They were embarrassed by Joseph\u2019s weakness in writing, and they worried that publishing the revelations might cause more problems for the Saints (see Saints, 1:140\u201343). How does section\u00a01 address these concerns? (see, for example, verses\u00a06, 24,\u00a038).\n\n\nThe lyrics of the hymn \u201cCome, Listen to a Prophet\u2019s Voice\u201d (Hymns, no.\u00a021) teach some of the same principles taught in section\u00a01. Perhaps you could sing or read the hymn together and then invite class members to find lines in the hymn and verses in section\u00a01 that teach the same principles.\n\n  ImageSolemn Assembly\n\nGod speaks to us through His servants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:12\u201330, 35\u201336\nThe Lord restored His gospel to help us face the challenges of the latter days.\n\n\n\nWhat thoughts did class members have as they read the description of the last days in verses 13\u201316? What is happening in the world today that fulfills these prophesied descriptions? Encourage class members to share anything they found in section\u00a01 that helped them feel peace and confidence despite the challenges of our day.\n\n\nTo help class members ponder the blessings we have because the gospel has been restored, you could write on the board What do verses 17\u201323 teach about why the Lord restored His gospel? Class members could search these verses and share their thoughts with each other. For example, how have the truths restored through Joseph Smith helped us increase our faith? (see verse\u00a021).\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:19\u201328\nThe Lord uses \u201cthe weak and the simple\u201d to accomplish His work.\n\n\n\nOne important theme of Doctrine and Covenants\u00a01 is the role of \u201cthe weak and the simple\u201d in the Lord\u2019s great latter-day work (verse\u00a023). Invite class members to search verses 19\u201328 to learn how the words \u201cweak\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d apply to us as the Lord\u2019s servants. As they share what they find, you could discuss questions like these: What characteristics does the Lord want His servants to have? What will the Lord accomplish through His servants in the latter days? How are the prophecies in these verses being fulfilled throughout the world and in our own lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nHelp learners liken the scriptures to themselves. The same truths that inspired the early Saints can help us face our challenges today. As you teach the Doctrine and Covenants, help class members make connections between the Lord\u2019s messages to Joseph Smith and what the Lord might say to them personally.

How might the messages on the title page enhance their study? Maybe you could write one or more questions on the board\u2014such as Why do we have the Book of Mormon? or How is the Book of Mormon different from other books?\u2014and invite class members to look for answers as they review the title page individually or in pairs.

Your class members might benefit from scanning the introduction and identifying three to five points that would be helpful to share with someone reading the Book of Mormon for the first time. Class members could then share what they find. They may even want to role-play introducing the Book of Mormon to someone. The videos suggested in \u201cAdditional Resources\u201d might also help.\n\n\nSome members of your class may have had experiences that confirmed the truth of Joseph Smith\u2019s words: \u201cA man would get nearer to God by abiding by [the Book of Mormon\u2019s] precepts, than by any other book.\u201d You might ask class members to share how living the truths they\u2019ve learned in the Book of Mormon has helped them get nearer to God.

Each of the three had ample reason and opportunity to renounce his testimony if it had been false, or to equivocate on details if any had been inaccurate. As is well known, because of disagreements or jealousies involving other leaders of the Church, each one of these three witnesses was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by about eight years after the publication of their testimony. All three went their separate ways, with no common interest to support a collusive effort. Yet to the end of their lives\u2014periods ranging from 12\u00a0to 50\u00a0years after their excommunications\u2014not one of these witnesses deviated from his published testimony or said anything that cast any shadow on its truthfulness\u201d (\u201cThe Witness: Martin Harris,\u201d Ensign, May 1999,\u00a036).\n\n\n\nThe testimony of John Whitmer.\n\nJohn Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, declared: \u201cI have never heard that any one of the three or eight witnesses ever denied the testimony that they have borne. \u2026 Our names have gone forth to all nations, tongues and people as a divine revelation from God. And it will bring to pass the designs of God according to the declaration therein contained\u201d (in Noel\u00a0B. Reynolds, ed., Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins [1997], 55\u201356).\n\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nSeek your own inspiration. Rather than viewing these outlines as instructions you must follow, use them to get ideas or to spark your own inspiration as you ponder the needs of those you teach.\n\n"}, {"text": "\nIn this resource, you will find the following three-step pattern repeated in each outline: invite sharing, teach the doctrine, and encourage learning at home. In many cases, as you teach, the elements of this pattern may overlap or occur in a different order. For example, consider that sharing is an opportunity to teach the doctrine, and teaching doctrine should involve invitations to share. Likewise, encouraging learning at home can happen throughout a class discussion. Allow adjustments in this pattern to happen naturally, following the promptings of the Spirit to meet the needs of the children you teach.\n\n\nInvite Sharing\n\n\nAs part of every class, invite the children to share their feelings, insights, and experiences about the principles you are teaching. Their comments may include experiences they have had learning at home. You might also review what they learned the previous week and ask how it has influenced their lives.\n\n\n\nTeach the Doctrine\n\n\nCome, Follow Me\u2014For Individuals and Families can help you better understand the doctrine you will teach to the children. Consider what scripture verses, quotations, experiences, questions, and other resources you might share to help the children understand and act on the gospel principles they learn. Help them recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost as He testifies of truth. Look for creative and inspired ways to help them be excited about what they are learning.\nFor ideas about how to use music to teach the doctrine, see the sections \u201cUsing Music to Teach Doctrine\u201d and \u201cHelping Children Learn and Remember Primary Songs and Hymns\u201d in the appendix of this manual.\n\n\n\nEncourage Learning at Home\n\nBecause the home is the center of gospel learning, one of your objectives as a Primary teacher is to encourage learning at home. How can you help the children share with their families what they learned in class? How can you encourage the children and their parents to continue to learn from the New Testament at home?\n\n"}, {"text": "\nEach outline in this resource follows a pattern of inviting sharing and teaching the doctrine.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nInvite Sharing\n\nAs part of every class, invite class members to share insights and experiences they had during the previous week as they studied the scriptures as individuals and families and applied what they learned. Help class members see that their personal learning outside of class is important. Their individual conversion will come not only through Sunday learning but also through their daily experiences. When class members hear each other\u2019s experiences and testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ, they are more likely to seek similar experiences of their own.\nNot everyone will have read the chapters for each lesson, and even some who did may not feel comfortable sharing.

So it\u2019s appropriate to begin studying the Doctrine and Covenants by considering the question that began the latter-day outpouring of revelation\u2014the one Joseph Smith asked in a grove of trees in 1820. A \u201cwar of words and tumult of opinions\u201d (Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:10) had left Joseph confused about religion and the state of his soul; perhaps you can relate to that. There are many conflicting ideas and persuasive voices in our day, and when we want to sort through these messages and find truth, we can do what Joseph did. We can ask questions, study the scriptures, ponder, and ultimately ask God. In response to Joseph\u2019s prayer, a pillar of light descended from heaven; God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared and answered his questions.

In addition, several secondhand accounts were written by people who heard Joseph talk about his vision. Although these accounts differ in some details, depending on the audience and setting, they are otherwise consistent. And each account adds details that help us better understand Joseph Smith\u2019s experience, just as each of the four Gospels helps us better understand the Savior\u2019s ministry.\nTo read Joseph\u2019s other accounts, see \u201cFirst Vision Accounts\u201d (Gospel Topics Essays, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).

Invite the children to say \u201csacrament.\u201d Tell the children that we learn in the scriptures that Jesus wants us to take the sacrament to remember Him. Open the Bible to Luke 22:19 and say, \u201cJesus said, \u2018This do in remembrance of me.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nPicture\n\nShow the picture of a deacon passing the sacrament (page\u00a0114). Point out details in the picture, such as the deacon and the people sitting quietly. Let the children hold the sacrament trays you brought while you explain in simple terms what happens during the administration of the sacrament\u2014we listen quietly while the sacrament is blessed; we take one piece of bread; we drink the water and put the cup back in the tray; and we think about Jesus.\n\n  Imagepassing the sacrament\n\n\n\n\nActivity Verse\n\nRecite the following activity verse, and invite the children to join you:\n\n\nQuietly I eat the bread (pretend to eat bread)\nAnd drink the water too. (pretend to drink water)\nI fold my arms and think of Jesus\u2014 (fold arms)\nThat\u2019s what I should do. (nod head up and down)\n\n\n[M.\u00a0W. Verbica, \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d Friend, Feb. 1995, 17]\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nShow the picture of Jesus on page\u00a0106. Ask the children, \u201cWho should we think about when we take the sacrament?\u201d Invite the children to say, \u201cJesus.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrayer\n\nInvite a child to give the closing prayer.\n\n\n\nTeaching Tips\n\nReverence: Use a quiet voice and respectful manner to help the children understand that the sacrament is sacred.\nHolding objects: Young children think simply and literally. They do not understand abstract ideas. Giving them objects to handle that are related to the lesson helps them learn. Make sure that they handle the sacrament trays with reverence and respect. There should not be any bread or water in the trays for this activity.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Activities\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\n\nFor the guest activity: Arrange for an Aaronic Priesthood holder to come to the nursery class and talk about how he helps administer the sacrament.\n\n\nFor the role play and the game: Copy the cards on page\u00a0115. Color the cards, if desired, and cut them out.\n\n\n  Imagecoloring page, sacrament book\n\nI can listen while the sacrament prayers are said.\nI can think of Jesus when I eat the bread.\nI can think of Jesus when I drink the water.\n\nThe sacrament helps me think about Jesus.\n\n\n\n\nFor the book: Copy and cut out the cards on page\u00a0115 for each child. Bring some yarn or string.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuest\n\nIntroduce your guest to the children. Explain that he has the priesthood. Ask him to talk briefly about how he prepares, blesses, or passes the sacrament. Invite him to share his feelings about the sacrament.\n\n\n\nRole Play\n\nHold up the cards you prepared, one at a time. Read the caption and have the children pretend to do what is shown in the drawing (for the first three cards only). For example, have them fold their arms and bow their heads and reverently pretend to take the bread and the water. Praise them for their efforts each time. When you hold up the drawing of Jesus, ask the children, \u201cWho should we think about when we take the sacrament?\u201d\n\n\n\nGame\n\nPlace the cards you prepared face down on the floor or on a table. Invite one of the children to turn over one of the cards. Read the caption on the card. Repeat until each child who wants a turn has had one.\n\n\n\nBook\n\nGive each child the four cards you prepared for them. Punch a hole in the corner of each card. Thread some yarn or string through the holes, and tie the string to make a small book for each child. Then read the book to the children.\n  Imagebook diagram\n\n\n\nTeaching Tips\n\nPrayer: You may want to give the opening or closing prayer yourself occasionally to show the children how to pray. They learn as much from your example as they do from what you say to them.\nReverence: When you ask the children who we should think about during the sacrament, some of them might shout the answer. If they do, gently teach them to use Jesus Christ\u2019s name with reverence.\nAdapt activities to meet your needs and resources. For example, if you don\u2019t have yarn or string to use for this activity, you can bind the cards together in some other way. Or you could let the children color the illustrations without making them into a book.\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\n  ImageJesus Christ.

The Savior was praying that we would receive much more than that. \u201cEternal life\u201d is \u201cthe quality of life that our Eternal Father lives. \u2026 Eternal life, or exaltation, is to live in God\u2019s presence and to continue as families (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1\u20134)\u201d (Gospel Topics, \u201cEternal Life,\u201d topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Consider recording this definition in your scriptures near verse 3 .\n\n\nAccording to verse 3, what is one of the things that is required of us to receive eternal life?\n\n\nOne truth we learn from the Savior\u2019s prayer is that to receive eternal life, we must know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\n\n\nWhy do you think we need to truly know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to receive eternal life?\n\n\nElder Michael John U.

Answer at least three of the following questions in your study journal: \n\n\nWhat do you learn about Jesus Christ\u2019s relationship with His Father from this prayer?\n\n\nWhat blessings does Jesus Christ desire for us?\n\n\nWhy do you think He would pray for you to receive these specific blessings?\n\n\nWhat did you learn about Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father that helps you want to know Them even better?\n\n\nImagine what it would be like to be so close to Heavenly Father and the Savior that your relationship could be described as being one with Them. How would that feel to you? How would your life be better? Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love you so much and desire to be one with you. Jesus Christ prayed to Heavenly Father to help you have a close relationship with Them. Keep in mind that such a relationship will take time and effort to develop, throughout this life and into the next.\nRecord in your study journal what you are willing to do to come to know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ better.

You would find a way to speak to them, you would listen to them, and you would discover ways to do things for each other. The more often that happened, the longer it went on, the deeper would be the bond of affection. If much time passed without the speaking, the listening, and the doing, the bond would weaken.\nGod is perfect and omnipotent, and you and I are mortal. But he is our Father, he loves us, and he offers the same opportunity to draw closer to him as would a loving friend.

It is to believe and have faith in Christ, to repent and be baptized, and to receive the Holy Ghost, \u201cand then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost\u201d [ 2 Nephi 31:17 ]. \u2026\nI have spoken of receiving the Savior\u2019s atoning grace to take away our sins and the stain of those sins in us.

Explain that after Alma was converted, he taught the people important things about the gospel. Let the children share what they know about the things he taught.\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine: Younger Children\n\n\n\nAlma 5:44\u201348\nI can gain my own testimony through the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe children you teach can develop their own strong testimonies, even while they are young.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nUse a picture of Alma the Younger (see Gospel Art Book, no.\u00a077) to review the account of the angel visiting him (see Mosiah\u00a027). Then ask the children to describe what a testimony is, and help them as necessary. Explain that Alma worked to gain a testimony after the angel visited him. Slowly read Alma 5:46 a few times, and invite the children to listen for what Alma did and how he knew the truth. (You may need to explain that fasting means going without food and water.)\n\n  ImageMongolia\n\nWhen we accept the gospel, it\u2019s like starting a new life.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay pictures of things that grow gradually and need constant care, like a plant or a baby animal. Ask the children to share how we take care of these things and help them grow. Remind them that we must also take constant care of our testimonies.\n\n\nUse an empty balloon to represent a testimony and blow air into it each time you share something that helps testimonies grow. Tie the balloon and pass it around, asking the children to share one thing they can do to help their testimonies grow. Invite the children to draw themselves doing things that will strengthen their testimonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma 7:10\u201313\nThe Savior took upon Himself my sins, pains, and afflictions.\n\nThe truths in Alma 7:10\u201313 can help the children know that Jesus Christ cares about them and can help them.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nShow the children a picture of Jesus. Explain that He knows what it\u2019s like to be hurt, sad, or scared. Read some of the words in Alma 7:11\u201313 that describe what the Savior suffered, and explain words the children might not understand. Point out that Jesus can help and comfort us when we are sad. Share how the Savior has helped and comforted you.\n\n\nAsk the children to share experiences when they were sick or in pain or had another problem that made them sad. Bear your testimony that the Savior has suffered those things too and knows how to help us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma 7:19\u201320\nThe path back to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is straight.\n\nHow can you use Alma\u2019s description of the path back to Heavenly Father to help the children learn to make good choices?\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nRead Alma 7:19 to the children, and explain that when we make good choices, we are in the path that leads back to Heavenly Father. Give the children a series of choices or actions (such as being unkind to family members or serving them). Ask them to tell you if each choice is good and leads back to God or if it is evil and leads away from Him.\n\n\nRead Alma 7:20 and help the children understand the words in these verses that describe the path back to God. Draw on the board a straight path from us to Heavenly Father. Then draw a crooked path that includes dead ends that lead away from God. Invite the children to trace both paths with their fingers. Which path is better? Help them think of good choices that will help them stay on the straight path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nTeach the Doctrine: Older Children\n\n\n\nAlma 5:12\u201314, 27\u201328, 57; 7:14\u201324\nI must be born again and then follow the path that leads back to God.\n\nHow can you help the children understand what it means to be born again?\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nShow the children a picture of a baby, and invite them to talk about what a baby is like when he or she is first born. Invite a child to read Alma 5:14. To help the children understand what it means to be \u201cspiritually \u2026 born of God,\u201d ask them to think about what Alma the Younger was like before he was converted. What was he like afterward? (See Mosiah 27:23\u201332 and Alma 36:12\u201324.) Explain that when we have faith in Jesus Christ and live His gospel, it is like we have started a new life, as a baby does.\n\n\nRead together Alma 7:19, and explain that after we are born again, we must follow \u201cthe path which leads to the kingdom of God.\u201d Hide papers around the room with the following scripture references written on them: Alma 5:12\u201313, 27\u201328, 57; 7:14\u201316, 23\u201324. Invite the children to find the papers, look up the scriptures, and share what each scripture teaches we must do to return to God\u2019s presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma 5:14, 44\u201348\nI can gain my own testimony through the Holy Ghost.\n\nAlma was visited by an angel, but his testimony was \u201cmade known unto [him] by the Holy Spirit\u201d (Alma 5:46).\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nRead with the children Alma 5:44\u201346. What did Alma do to gain his own testimony of the gospel? Give each child a piece of paper and invite them to make a plan to do one thing this week to strengthen their testimonies.\n\n\nPass around a mirror and let children look at their reflections as you read Alma 5:14. What does it mean to have the Savior\u2019s image in our countenance? Share times when someone said or did something that reminded you of the Savior, and ask the children to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma 7:10\u201313\nThe Savior took upon Himself my sins, pains, and afflictions.\n\nAs you study Alma\u00a07, ponder how you can build the children\u2019s faith in Jesus Christ so that they will turn to Him in their trials.\n\n\nPossible Activities\n\n\n\nInvite the children to read Alma 7:11\u201313, looking for the things Jesus Christ suffered. They may be willing to share experiences when they felt pain, sickness, or afflictions. According to these verses, why was the Savior willing to suffer all of this? (Explain that \u201csuccor\u201d means \u201cto help.\u201d)\n\n\nTell the children about an illness, injury, or other affliction you have had, and ask if they have felt something similar. Read together Alma 7:11\u201313, and point out what Jesus suffered for us. Help the children think of times when the Savior experienced these things, such as when He was tempted (see Matthew 4:1\u201311) or when He was suffering in Gethsemane. How does it help us to know that Jesus understands our struggles? Share your testimony of Jesus\u2019s power to comfort, help, and heal us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nEncourage Learning at Home\n\nInvite the children to hang a picture of Jesus in a place where they will see it often to remind them of what they learned about Him today.\n\n\n\nImproving Our Teaching\n\nImprove as a Christlike teacher. As a teacher, it is important to ponder ways you can increase your ability to help the children build their faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider using the personal evaluation questions on page\u00a037 of Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way.\n\n"}, {"text": "\n\nBrightly\n\n\nSaturday is a special day.\nIt\u2019s the day we get ready for Sunday:\nWe clean the house, and we shop at the store,\nSo we won\u2019t have to work until Monday.\nWe brush our clothes, and we shine our shoes,\nAnd we call it our get-the-work-done day.\nThen we trim our nails, and we shampoo our hair,\nSo we can be ready for Sunday.\n\n\n\nWords: Rita S.

Samuel was a boy when the Lord first spoke to him. Mary was likely a young woman when an angel visited her, announcing that she would be the mother of the Savior. And Joseph Smith was 14\u00a0years old when the Lord called him to restore the gospel. More recently, President Russell\u00a0M. Nelson invited all young people to \u201cenlist in the youth battalion of the Lord to help gather Israel (\u201cHope of Israel\u201d [worldwide youth devotional, June\u00a03, 2018], ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Certainly, when the Lord said, \u201cThou, Israel, art my servant\u201d (Isaiah 41:8), this included all of His covenant people, including those in your class or quorum.\nEven though we all covenant to serve God when we are baptized, not all young people see themselves as the Lord\u2019s servants. They may not recognize the unique ways they can help with His work. Look for passages in Isaiah 41\u201344 and section 1.2 of the General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that could help the youth understand what it means to be the Lord\u2019s servants.\n\n  ImageTemple Family History\n\nEach young person is uniquely able to contribute to the work of salvation and exaltation.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn Together\n\nIsaiah 41\u201344 can help the youth understand what it means to be a servant of the Lord. To begin a discussion, you could write references like these on the board: Isaiah 41:8\u201310; 42:6\u20137; 43:9\u201312; 44:21. Each person could pick a passage, read it, and share what he or she learns about what it means to be a servant of the Lord. In what ways are we the Lord\u2019s servants? What blessings come when we are in His service? Here are other ways to help those you teach bring people to Christ as active participants in His work.\n\n\nDo those you teach understand what \u201cthe work of salvation and exaltation\u201d is? To help them, you might assign them to study (individually or in small groups) one of the four subsections of section 1.2 of the General Handbook. Each subsection describes an aspect of the work. Ask the youth to ponder questions like these: What are specific things a person my age could do to participate in this aspect of the work of salvation? What can our class or quorum do? Each person or group could share what they learned, along with answers to the questions.\n\n\nThose you teach may benefit by learning more about the four aspects of the work of salvation and exaltation\u2014living the gospel of Jesus Christ, caring for those in need, inviting all to receive the gospel, and uniting families for eternity. They could choose an aspect that they are interested in and explore some of the items related to it under \u201cSupporting Resources.\u201d Let the youth share what they found that inspires them to become more converted to the Lord and help others do the same. They could then make plans to do something that helps accomplish this work. The class or quorum president could lead this discussion.\n\n\nTo help the youth ponder how they can use their talents to bring souls to Christ, you could ask each of them to study a section of Elder John\u00a0C. Pingree\u00a0Jr.\u2019s message \u201cI Have a Work for Thee\u201d (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 32\u201335). They could share how what they learned might help someone who isn\u2019t sure that he or she can help with the Lord\u2019s work. You could also review together the section \u201cDiscover and Develop Spiritual Gifts\u201d in Elder Pingree\u2019s message. How does the Lord help us discover and develop our talents?\n\n\n\n\n\nAct in Faith\n\nEncourage class or quorum members to ponder and record what they will do to act on the impressions they received today. If they would like, they could share their ideas. Invite them to think about how acting on their impressions will strengthen their relationships with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nSupporting Resources\n\n\n\nLive the gospel of Jesus Christ: 2\u00a0Nephi 31:17\u201321; 3\u00a0Nephi 27:13\u201321; \u201cFollowing God\u201d (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n\n\n\nCare for those in need: Matthew 25:34\u201340; Mosiah 18:8\u20139; \u201cYou Are the Gift\u201d (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n\n\n\nInvite all to receive the gospel: Matthew 5:14\u201316; 1\u00a0Peter 3:15; \u201cSharing Your Beliefs\u201d (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n\n\n\nUnite families for eternity: Doctrine and Covenants 2; 128:18; \u201cBecause of James\u201d (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching in the Savior\u2019s Way\n\n\u201cIf the youth sense that you trust them, their confidence in their divine potential will grow\u201d (Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way,\u00a028).\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\n  ImageNewport Beach Seminary\nThis lesson is intended to help you evaluate the goals you have set and the learning and personal growth you have experienced during your study of the New Testament.\n\n\nCome unto Jesus Christ and become His disciple\n\nTake some time to reflect on how you are growing as a disciple of Jesus Christ and seeking to more fully come unto Him as you study the New Testament. Some of the ways that you have been encouraged to do this are in your ability to receive and follow personal revelation and explain some of the roles and titles of Jesus Christ and in your efforts to seek peace in this life through Jesus Christ. Seek to know from your Father in Heaven how you are growing and developing in these ways as well as any actions you should continue making or adjust in order to continue deepening your discipleship to Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nIncrease your ability to receive revelation\n\nTake a minute to listen to sounds around you.\n\n\nWhat sounds can you hear only when you are listening carefully?\n\n\nWhat can you do when you hear something very faintly and you want to know what it is?\n\n\n\n\nHow is this activity like receiving revelation from the Holy Ghost?\n\n\nAn important objective in seminary is to help you increase your ability to receive personal revelation from the Holy Ghost.\nIn the Book of Mormon, Nephi described the Holy Ghost as a \u201cstill small voice\u201d that we feel more than we hear ( 1 Nephi 17:45). We can improve our ability to hear or feel the Holy Ghost in our hearts in ways similar to those we use to listen for a quiet sound. Drawing spiritually closer to God, being still in our mind, focusing our thoughts, and blocking out background noise are all effective ways to increase our ability to recognize the whispering of the Holy Ghost.\nTake some time to reflect on recent experiences you have had receiving personal revelation from the Holy Ghost. You might review notes you have written in your scriptures or study journal. You might also ask Heavenly Father to help you recognize or remember the personal revelation you have received. Then record the thoughts and feelings that come to your mind and heart.\n\n\nWhat recent experiences have you had receiving personal revelation? How did you recognize these experiences as being from God?\n\n\nWhat have you learned in your study of the New Testament that can help you recognize the Holy Ghost?\n\n\nWhat insights could you share with someone struggling to recognize the Spirit?\n\n\nOne of the main roles of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son (see Matthew 16:17 ; John 15:26 ; 3 Nephi 11:32).\n\n\nWhat has the Spirit helped you understand or feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\n\n\nHow are the gift of the Holy Ghost and the opportunity for personal revelation evidence of God\u2019s love for you?\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain roles and titles of Jesus Christ\n\n  ImageLoaf of bread\n  ImageThe Good Shepherd\n\n\nHow did the Savior use bread and sheep to teach about Himself?\n\n\nYou may recall the Savior teaching in metaphors like \u201cI am the bread of life\u201d (see John 6:35, 41, 48, 51), \u201cI am the good shepherd\u201d ( John 10:11), and \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life\u201d ( John 11:25).\n\n\nWhat do these titles teach you about the Savior\u2019s character and the roles He can play in your life?\n\n\nHow does understanding His character and roles help you love Him more?\n\n\nAs you have studied the New Testament, you may have kept a list in your study journal of the roles and titles of Jesus Christ. If you have this list, take a few minutes to review it. Add any titles or roles you may have missed. If you have not yet created that list, you may want to start it now, listing any roles or titles that you can think of. If you can\u2019t think of any, consider reviewing \u201cThe Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\u201d (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) or \u201cJesus Christ\u201d in Guide to the Scriptures or the Topical Guide for some ideas.\n   1. Choose one of the following activities to complete in your study journal, or come up with your own similar activity. \n\n\nWrite a thank-you card to the Savior, focusing on one or more of His roles or titles. Include any experiences you have had recognizing Him fulfilling that role in your life, and express your gratitude.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a visual that explains the Savior\u2019s roles or titles. Include applicable scripture references and why these roles or titles are meaningful to you. Consider sharing it on social media when you finish.\n\n\nWrite a short talk or prepare a mini lesson about one or more of the Savior\u2019s roles or titles that you could teach as a seminary devotional, as a home evening lesson, or in a church class. Include what the role or title means and any experiences you have had when He fulfilled that role in your life.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel an increased desire to seek peace in Christ\n\nIn your study of the New Testament, you have likely had opportunities to learn and think about the peace that can come from Jesus Christ. For example, you might remember the Savior\u2019s invitation for us to come unto Him when we feel heavy laden (see Matthew 11:28\u201330) or Jesus walking on the water and helping lift Peter up when he began to sink (see Matthew 14:26\u201333). You might have had the opportunity to draw a picture in your study journal as part of the lesson on Mark 4:35\u201341 that discussed Jesus Christ calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee. If you have any notes in your study journal from these lessons, consider reviewing them.\nPonder and answer the following questions in your study journal so you can track your spiritual progress.\n\n\nHow have your desires to find peace in Christ changed as you have studied His life and ministry?\n\n\nHave you felt an increase or a decrease of peace in Christ in the last few weeks? If so, what do you think has contributed to this change?\n\n\nWhy do you think Jesus Christ is the source of peace?\n\n\nWhy do you think the Savior wants to give you His peace?\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\n\nLiltingly\n\n\nLatter-day prophets are: number one,\nJoseph Smith; then Brigham Young;\nJohn Taylor came third, we know;\nThen Wilford Woodruff; Lorenzo Snow;\nJoseph F.

This started a conversation between Mary and Elisabeth in which Mary rejoiced and praised God.\nRead Luke 1:46\u201355 . As you study Mary\u2019s words, pause and reflect on the meaning of specific words or phrases. Pausing and reflecting can invite inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you understand the scriptures more deeply. For example, you could pause at \u201clow\u201d or \u201chandmaiden\u201d in verse 48 . These words could give insight into Mary\u2019s humility and reverence toward God. The words in this verse could help you see that God knows and loves His children regardless of their circumstances.

Renlund, \u201cConsider the Goodness and Greatness of God,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2020, 44)\n\n\nComplete the following steps to help you recognize Heavenly Father\u2019s blessings and praise Him for His goodness.\nStep 1:\nReflect on your answers to the following questions.\n\n\nWhat are some blessings from Heavenly Father that you are most grateful for?\n\n\nWhat do these blessings help you understand about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\n\n\nWhen have you felt joy because of recognizing God\u2019s blessings for you or someone you know?\n\n\nWhat scripture story or verse helps you want to praise God?\n\n\nStep 2:Choose how you will praise God. Here are some ideas you could choose from:\n\n\nWrite a poem or song.\n\n\nDraw a picture.\n\n\nOffer a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\nBear your testimony to someone.\n\n\nWrite in a personal journal.\n\n\nShare your feelings about God on social media.\n\n\nYou could also come up with your own idea. Once you have made your choice, begin taking action. If it is not possible to begin right now, write down a detailed plan of what you will do. For example, if you want to offer a prayer of gratitude, you could write down when and where you will pray and what you might express gratitude for. You could share your ideas with a parent or Church leader who can remind you to carry out your plan.\n   1. Write in your study journal a description of what you did to praise God and why you chose this method. \n\n\n\nOptional: Want to Learn More?\n\n\n\n\nLuke 1:46\u201355 . Why is Mary praising the Lord?\n\nVerses 46\u201355 of Luke 1 are traditionally known as the Song of Mary. These praises associate the birth of Jesus Christ with Israel\u2019s sacred past. The words celebrate the Lord\u2019s mercy in once again reaching out to bless and honor His people\u2014particularly those of \u201clow degree\u201d ( Luke 1:52).\n\n\n\nLuke 1:53 . How does the Lord fill \u201cthe hungry with good things\u201d?\n\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about the Savior\u2019s invitation to come unto Him and be filled:\n\n  ImageJeffrey R. Holland\nI pray this morning that all who are hungering and thirsting, and sometimes wandering, will hear this invitation from Him who is the Bread of Life, the Fountain of Living Water, the Good Shepherd of us all, the Son of God: \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, \u2026 and ye shall find rest unto your souls\u201d [ Matthew 11:28\u201329 ]. Truly He does fill \u201cthe hungry with good things,\u201d as His own mother Mary testified [ Luke 1:53 ]. Come, and feast at the table of the Lord in what I testify to be His true and living Church, led by a true and living prophet. \n\n(Jeffrey R. Holland, \u201cHe Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things,\u201d Ensign, Nov. 1997, 66)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can happen when we remember God\u2019s goodness?\n\nElder Dean M. Davies of the Seventy taught the following about what happens when we recognize how God is blessing us:\n\n  ImageDean M. Davies\nEvery day, but especially on the Sabbath day, we have the extraordinary opportunity to experience the wonder and awe of heaven and offer our praises to God for His blessed goodness and overwhelming mercy. \u2026\nWhen we worship, our hearts are drawn out in praise to our blessed God morning, noon, and night.\nWe hallow and honor Him continually\u2014in our meetinghouses, homes, temples, and all our labors.\nWhen we worship, we open our hearts to the healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\nOur lives become the token and expression of our worship. \n\n(Dean M. Davies, \u201cThe Blessings of Worship,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 94\u201395)\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\n  ImageMary, Joseph, and Jesus Flee to Egypt\nAfter the Wise Men gave their gifts to the Christ child, the Lord warned them not to return to King Herod. An angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family to Egypt. These warnings saved the young Jesus from Herod\u2019s slaughter of all children two years old and under in the area around Bethlehem. After Herod\u2019s death, the Lord instructed Joseph to return to Israel. Just as the Lord blessed the Wise Men, Joseph, and Mary with revelation, He wants to bless you with revelation too. In this lesson you will identify some ways the Lord can communicate with you. You will also be invited to look for this communication in your own life.\n\nHelping students identify principles. An important skill for students to acquire and practice during their time in seminary is the ability to identify principles from the scriptures. When students are able to identify principles, their ability to understand and live the gospel will increase.\n\n\nStudent preparation: Ask students to pay attention to how the Lord is trying to communicate with them, including through revelation and inspiration from the Holy Ghost. Encourage students to make note of these communications.\n\n\n\nPossible Learning Activities\n\n\n\nThe Lord warns the Wise Men and Joseph\n\n\nConsider displaying the following questions. To help students recognize what they know and may not know about receiving revelation, invite them to answer these questions in their study journals.\n\nThink about ways Heavenly Father has communicated with you in your life, and answer the following questions.\n\n\nHow well do you think you recognize when Heavenly Father is communicating with you?\n\n\nWhat are some ways God has given you revelation or guidance?\n\n\nIn what area of your life do you feel you most need Heavenly Father\u2019s guidance and direction?\n\n\n\nConsider asking students to share ways God communicates with them or inviting them to ask questions they have about receiving revelation.\n\nAs you study Matthew 2, you will have an opportunity to learn about receiving guidance and direction from Heavenly Father.\nAt the time of the Savior\u2019s birth, the ruler in Judea was known as Herod the Great. He was a wicked man. When he met with the Wise Men, he asked them to return and inform him of what they discovered about the Christ child (see Matthew 2:8). Because of Herod\u2019s wickedness, God warned the Wise Men and sent an angel to warn Joseph in a dream.\n\nThe next portion of the lesson is intended to help students practice identifying principles when they study the scriptures.\n\nAs you study the scriptures, it is important to identify principles. A principle is an enduring truth that can provide you with perspective and help you in making decisions. We can often identify principles by answering questions like the following:\n\n\nWhat do you think was the moral or point of the story?\n\n\nWhy do you think the writer included these events or passages in their record?\n\n\nWhat lessons might the writer have intended for us to learn?\n\n\nChoose one of the questions above, and answer it as you ponder Matthew 2:11\u201316 .\n\n\nWhat is a principle you identified from Matthew 2:11\u201316 ?\n\n\n\nAs needed, help students identify their own principles. Consider inviting students to write their principles on the board. Compliment students as they identify principles. Students may identify a principle similar to the following: The Lord can warn us and protect us from danger.\n\n\n\nHow can the principle you identified help you with decisions in your life?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord will warn us\n\nFrom  Matthew 2:11\u201316, you may have identified a principle about receiving warnings from the Lord. President Boyd K. Packer (1924\u20132015) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave a promise about warnings through the Holy Ghost.\n\n  ImagePacker, Boyd K.\nIt is not expected that you go through life without making mistakes, but you will not make a major mistake without first being warned by the promptings of the Spirit. This promise applies to all members of the Church.\n\n(Boyd K. Packer, \u201cCounsel to Youth,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 18)\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Heavenly Father\u2019s desire to warn us by the Spirit tell us about His nature and character?\n\n\nHow might looking for and responding to the promptings and warnings of the Spirit help you now and in the future?\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph, Mary, and Jesus return from Egypt\n\n\nConsider available class time and students\u2019 needs, and adapt the next portion of the lesson accordingly. For example, students could read Matthew 2:19\u201323 and identify their own principle, they could summarize the verses, or they could discuss ways the Lord can communicate with us.\n\nIn Matthew 2:19\u201323, we read that when Herod died, the Lord gave another message to Joseph while he, Mary, and Jesus were in Egypt. From this communication with Joseph, we learn that if we are willing to listen and obey, we can receive revelation and guidance.\nRead Matthew 2:19\u201323, looking for details that teach this principle.\n\nAs students share what they found, help them understand some of the ways the Holy Ghost can communicate with us. Consider using some of the material in the \u201cCommentary and Background Information\u201d and \u201cSupplemental Learning Activities\u201d sections.\nStudents may benefit from watching the video \u201cReceiving Revelation\u201d (4:17), looking for ways the Holy Ghost can communicate with us. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\n\nIn Matthew 2, God communicated with the Wise Men and Joseph through dreams and through visitations from angels. Father in Heaven communicates with His children in many other ways as well, including through inspiration and revelation from the Holy Ghost. As you study the gospel at home and in seminary, pay attention to what you are learning from the scriptures as well as what Heavenly Father is teaching you through the Holy Ghost. Your gospel study can be enhanced and more personal as you listen for what God is teaching you through His Spirit.\n\n\n\nPossible discussion questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some ways the Lord communicates with you?\n\n\nWhat experiences have you had in which the Holy Ghost has warned or guided you? How did these experiences impact your life?\n\n\nIf you were to hear the Savior\u2019s voice speaking to you through the Holy Ghost as you study, how would this affect your seminary experience?\n\n\nWhat do you feel you can do to be more receptive to the guidance and revelation of the Holy Ghost that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ want to give you?\n\n\n\nConsider sharing a personal experience and inviting students to look for ways Heavenly Father is communicating with them in their daily lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary and Background Information\n\n\n\nHow can the Holy Ghost help me?\n\nPresident Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency taught:\n\n  ImageHenry B. Eyring Official Portrait 2018\nThe companionship of the Holy Ghost makes what is good more attractive and temptation less compelling. That alone should be enough to make us determined to qualify for the Spirit to be with us always.\n\n(Henry B. Eyring, \u201cThe Holy Ghost as Your Companion,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 104)\n\n\nElder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:\n\n  ImageRonald A. Rasband\nOur Father in Heaven knew that in mortality we would face challenges, tribulation, and turmoil; He knew we would wrestle with questions, disappointments, temptations, and weaknesses. To give us mortal strength and divine guidance, He provided the Holy Spirit, another name for the Holy Ghost.\n\n(Ronald A. Rasband, \u201cLet the Holy Spirit Guide,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I recognize when the Lord is speaking to me?\n\nTo hear examples of how various individuals receive revelation, watch the video \u201cReceiving Revelation\u201d (4:17), available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\n\nIf you want to learn more about ways the Holy Ghost can speak to you, consider reading the article \u201cEight Ways God Can Speak to You\u201d by President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency (New Era, Sept. 2004, 4\u20138).\n\n\n\nWhy did Herod slaughter innocent children?\n\nKing Herod, \u201ctroubled\u201d by the news that another \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d had been born ( Matthew 2:2\u20133), wanted to kill Jesus to secure his own throne. Knowing that Jesus had been born in Bethlehem about two years earlier, Herod ordered the deaths of all children there under the age of two (see Matthew 2:4, 7, 12\u201316). Herod was infamously ruthless against suspected threats, even having his wife and three of his sons executed (see Bible Dictionary, \u201cHerod\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Learning Activities\n\n\n\n\nWays the Holy Ghost can communicate with us\n\n\nConsider using the following scriptures to help students recognize various ways the Lord can communicate with us.\n1 Kings 19:12 ; John 14:26 ; 2 Nephi 32:3 ; Moroni 8:26 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:23 ; Doctrine and Covenants 8:2\u20133 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord can communicate with us in seminary\n\n\nStudents may benefit from thinking about and discussing questions such as \u201cWhat are you hearing through the Spirit that is not being said in class?\u201d or \u201cHow can you invite the Lord to teach you as you study in seminary?\u201d Encourage students to record the guidance and revelation they receive from the Lord in seminary. As needed, refer to the lesson \u201cLearning by the Spirit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of being warned by the Spirit\n\n\nIf students would benefit from hearing examples of individuals being warned by the Spirit, consider relating one or both of the following experiences:\nPresident Wilford Woodruff being warned to move his carriage (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff [2004], 46\u201347).\nElder Kenneth Johnson of the Seventy being warned in his youth (see \u201cYielding to the Enticings of the Holy Spirit,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2002, 89\u201391).\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "\n\nSimply / Joyously\n\n\n1.

Invite them to determine which scripture relates to Official Declaration\u00a01 (which led to the end of plural marriage) and which relates to Official Declaration\u00a02 (which made the blessings of the priesthood and the temple available to people of all races). Bear your testimony that the Lord reveals His will to ancient and modern prophets.\n\n\nWrite the following from Official Declaration\u00a01 on the board: \u201cYou have to judge for yourselves.\u201d What does it mean to judge for ourselves when the prophet receives revelation?

Fittingly, it ends with similar words: \u201cI am \u2026 the beginning and the end\u201d (Revelation 22:13). But what does that mean? The beginning and the end of what? The book of Revelation powerfully testifies that Jesus Christ is the beginning and end of everything\u2014of the great, sweeping drama of human existence and salvation. He is \u201cthe Lamb slain from the foundation of the world\u201d (Revelation 13:8). And He is the King of kings who brings an end to wickedness, sorrow, and even death itself and ushers in \u201ca new heaven and a new earth\u201d (Revelation 21:1).\nYet before this new heaven and new earth arrive, there is much for us to overcome: plagues, wars, rampant wickedness\u2014all of which Revelation vividly describes. But Jesus Christ is with us during this part too. He is the \u201cbright and morning star\u201d that shines in the dark sky as a promise that dawn is coming soon (Revelation 22:16). And it is coming soon. He is coming. Even as He invites us, \u201cCome unto me\u201d (Matthew 11:28), He also comes to us. \u201cI come quickly,\u201d He declares. And with hope and faith that has been purified in the fires of latter-day adversity, we answer, \u201cEven so, come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20).\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nRevelation 16\u201318; 21\u201322\nThe Lord invites me to flee Babylon and inherit \u201cthe holy city.\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing the destruction and perils of the last days, John saw a future day that can be summed up in the Lord\u2019s declaration \u201cBehold, I make all things new\u201d (Revelation 21:5). One way to understand what that means is to contrast John\u2019s description of Babylon, the symbol of worldliness and wickedness (see Revelation 16\u201318), with his description of the new Jerusalem, symbolic of celestial glory in God\u2019s presence (see Revelation 21\u201322).

What do you find in Revelation 21\u201322 that inspires you to do so?\n\n\n\n\n  ImageThe Last Judgement\n\nThe Last Judgement, by John Scott\n\n\nRevelation 20:12\u201315; 21:1\u20134\nAll of God\u2019s children will be judged out of the book of life.\n\nSuppose an author offered to write a book about your life. What details or experiences would you want included? If you knew that your future actions would also be recorded, how would you approach your life differently? Think about this as you read Revelation 20:12\u201315. What do you hope will be written about you in the book of life? How would you describe the Savior\u2019s role in your book of life? In your opinion, why is it significant that it is called \u201cthe Lamb\u2019s book of life\u201d? (Revelation 21:27).\nIf the thought of standing before God to be judged is uncomfortable for you, consider reading Revelation 21:1\u20134. Referring to these verses, Elder Dieter\u00a0F. Uchtdorf has said:\n\u201cThat Day of Judgment will be a day of mercy and love\u2014a day when broken hearts are healed, when tears of grief are replaced with tears of gratitude, when all will be made right. Yes, there will be deep sorrow because of sin. Yes, there will be regrets and even anguish because of our mistakes, our foolishness, and our stubbornness that caused us to miss opportunities for a much greater future.\n\u201cBut I have confidence that we will not only be satisfied with the judgment of God; we will also be astonished and overwhelmed by His infinite grace, mercy, generosity, and love for us, His children\u201d (\u201cO\u00a0How Great the Plan of Our God!,\u201d Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016,\u00a021).\nHow do these truths affect the way you view the Final Judgment?

He had suffered many trials, including being falsely accused and imprisoned. When he finally saw his brothers again, Joseph was the governor of all Egypt, second only to the pharaoh. He could easily have taken revenge on them, and considering what they had done to Joseph, that might seem understandable. And yet Joseph forgave his brothers. Not only that, but he helped them see divine purpose in his suffering. \u201cGod meant it unto good\u201d (Genesis 50:20), he told them, because it put him in a position to save \u201call his father\u2019s household\u201d (Genesis 47:12) from famine.\nIn many ways, Joseph\u2019s life parallels that of Jesus Christ. Even though our sins caused Him great suffering, the Savior offers forgiveness, delivering all of us from a fate far worse than famine. Whether we need to receive forgiveness or extend it\u2014at some point we all need to do both\u2014Joseph\u2019s example points us to the Savior, the true source of healing and reconciliation.\n\n\nImageIntegrated Curriculum Illustration\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n\n\n\nGenesis 45:1\u20138; 50:20\n  \u201cGod sent me before you to preserve you.\u201d\n\nAs you have read about Joseph, have you noticed any similarities between his story and the atoning mission of Jesus Christ? You might ponder how Joseph\u2019s role in his family is similar to the Savior\u2019s role in God\u2019s family. What parallels do you see between Joseph\u2019s experiences and the mission of the Savior, who was sent \u201cto save [us] by a great deliverance\u201d? (Genesis 45:7).\n\n\n\nGenesis\u00a045; 50:15\u201321\n  Forgiveness brings healing.\n\nReading about Joseph forgiving his brothers for the terrible things they did to him may prompt you to think about someone you are currently struggling to forgive. Or perhaps a difficult test of forgiveness is in your future. Either way, it might help to ponder why Joseph was able to forgive. What clues about Joseph\u2019s character and attitude do you find in Genesis\u00a045; 50:15\u201321? How might his experiences have influenced him to be more forgiving? What does Joseph\u2019s example suggest about how you can become more forgiving with the Savior\u2019s help?\nNotice also the blessings that came to Joseph\u2019s family because of his forgiveness. What blessings have you seen from forgiveness? Do you feel inspired to reach out to someone who has wronged you?\nSee also Genesis 33:1\u20134; Doctrine and Covenants 64:9\u201311; Larry\u00a0J.

Thankfully, the restored gospel gives us some additional understanding. When you read the blessing to Joseph in Genesis 49:22\u201326, read the following verses too, and see what insights they provide: 1\u00a0Nephi 15:12; 2\u00a0Nephi 3:4\u20135; Jacob 2:25; Doctrine and Covenants 50:44.\nAs you read about Judah\u2019s blessing in Genesis 49:8\u201312, remember that both King David and Jesus Christ are descendants of Judah. What words and phrases in these verses remind you of the Savior? When you study Judah\u2019s blessing, it may help to also read Revelation 5:5\u20136,\u00a09; 1\u00a0Nephi 15:14\u201315; Doctrine and Covenants 45:59; 133:46\u201350.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about Jacob\u2019s sons and the tribes of Israel who descended from them, there is an entry for each in the Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n\n\n\nGenesis 50:24\u201325; Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24\u201338 (in the Bible appendix)\n\u201cA seer shall the Lord my God raise up.\u201d\n\nThrough Joseph\u2019s dreams (see Genesis 37:5\u201311) and his interpretations of others\u2019 dreams (see Genesis 40\u201341), the Lord revealed things that would happen days or years in the future. But the Lord also revealed to Joseph what would happen in the coming centuries. Specifically, he learned about the prophetic missions of Moses and Joseph Smith. As you read Joseph\u2019s words in Genesis 50:24\u201325 and in Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24\u201338 (in the Bible appendix), ask yourself how knowing these things might have blessed Joseph and the children of Israel. Why do you think it was important for the Lord to restore this prophecy through Joseph Smith? (see also 2\u00a0Nephi\u00a03).\nHow has Joseph Smith fulfilled the prophecies in Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50: 27\u201328, 30\u201333?

Encourage family members to try to understand the emotions and perspectives of the characters. You might focus especially on the feelings of Joseph toward his brothers and on how they might have felt when he forgave them.

What details from Joseph\u2019s experiences exemplify what the hymn teaches?\n\n\nGenesis 49:9\u201311, 24\u201325.  What do we find in these verses that teaches us about the roles and mission of Jesus Christ?
